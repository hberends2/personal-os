### Market Opportunity & Product Vision

- Hospitality represents 7-8% global real estate value
	- More complex, bespoke property type than multifamily
	- Industry 10 years behind commercial real estate in automation
- Current gaps in hotel analytics:
	- No pipeline management automation
	- No automated communication systems
	- No AVMs (unlike multifamily)
- Target customers: Lenders, owners, brokers, appraisers, managers
	- 30% of US hotel loans coming due next year
	- Loan servicing automation layer opportunity

### Data Product Strategy

- Cap rate information standardization opportunity
	- Currently inconsistent definitions (trailing 12, forward 12, with/without capex)
	- First product with actual, real NOI data
- Three-part data integration:
	- Historical information and projections from underwriting
	- Digitizing closing process (HUD statements with actual purchase prices)
	- Capex module development
- Forward-looking investment data product (industry first)
- Real revenue from data products, not just workflow automation
