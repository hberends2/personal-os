### Business Development Update

- Mark had breakthrough Wednesday after DealPath webinar and friend’s demo of agentic AI
	- First time hearing about AI agents in structured format
	- Friend convinced typing will become obsolete, everything moving to voice
	- Mark now fully aligned on AI strategy and messaging
- Team agreement: need pitch deck before any client conversations
	- Mark and Drew prefer structured approach vs relationship-building style
	- Scheduling 2-hour deck development session today
	- Will incorporate AI content and pricing information
- Upcoming calls being limited until deck finalized
	- Stacy Naldoni (Western Alliance Bank) - afternoon call about job posting alignment
	- Mike Skiba discussion tomorrow - potential fractional CFO and tech stack advisory

### Funding Strategy Tensions

- Critical working capital needs vs Mark’s cautious approach
	- Team cannot survive until March without fundraising
	- Target: $100-150k pre-seed by Labor Day (30-45 days)
	- Mark’s previous bad funding experience creating resistance
- Potential funding sources identified:
	- Carlos Rodriguez Jr. (Driftwood family office) - exploring services/investment trade
	- Peachtree Hotel Group expressed interest in gap funding ($170k mentioned)
	- Goal: 2-3 checks of ~$50k each to bridge to beta phase
- Beta client strategy discussion
	- Consider one beta client per persona vs focusing solely on debt/structured finance
	- Target mix: scale client (Berkadia/CBRE level) plus others

### Pricing Model Refinement

- Subscription model vulnerable to AI disruption
	- Companies like DocuSign at risk from $90 → $9 alternatives
	- Outcome-based pricing can generate 5-10x revenue vs subscriptions
- Need hybrid/outcome-based model before deck finalization
	- Numbers in current pricing document are suggestions only
	- Business model more important than specific rates
	- Cost structure still being determined

### Operational Infrastructure

- LLC documentation needs immediate completion
	- Five equal founders structure under scrutiny from investors
	- Need majority vs unanimous vote designations
	- Attorney consultation required for equity structure guidance
- CRM system development in progress
	- HubSpot/Salesforce too expensive, building custom solution
	- Free tier approach using open-source tools
	- PostHog for user tracking (free up to 1M clicks)
- Engineering progress solid but requires tighter product management oversight
	- Some deviations from POC requirements noted
	- Need InnVestAI emails for offshore team document access
