### RedIQ Shutdown & Job Market Challenges

- Radix acquired RedIQ but made catastrophic decisions in January 2025
	- Pulled all engineers off RedIQ to fix their struggling main product
	- Had promised data integration opportunities that never materialized
	- Sudden Friday layoffs via HR calls with no prior warning to team
	- Only 2 junior engineers retained to maintain basic operations
- Key departures included JPP (VP level), Ben Coleman, Vinod, and entire development team
	- Ben Coleman and Tenzing kept on but reassigned to sell Radix products only
	- One data scientist made progress on AI rent roll processing before shutdown
- Howard’s job search brutal: only 1 response from multiple resumes sent
	- Single interview canceled 30 minutes before start (position already filled)
	- Led to pivot toward entrepreneurship rather than continued employment search

### InnVestAI Startup Formation & Market Opportunity

- Founded after Diane Fox (hospitality consultant) reconnected post-RedIQ shutdown
	- Diane had pitched RedIQ for hotels 2 years ago but Berkadia/Radix rejected non-multifamily focus
	- Market research confirmed zero competition: entire hotel industry still uses Excel for valuations
	- Unlike multifamily real estate, no existing valuation platforms exist in hospitality
- Five co-founder structure with complementary expertise:
	- Howard Berends: Product development and technical leadership
	- Diane Fox: Industry relationships, decades of hospitality experience across all sectors
	- Mark Gordon: Former Cushman & Wakefield national hospitality sales head, hotel development company owner
	- Drew: Hotel asset management background, merging existing Power BI reporting company
	- Vinod: Lead engineer from RedIQ team, recruited by Shoma to Berkadia before joining startup
- Technical progress: Howard built no-code proof of concept, 3 offshore developers now building production MVP
	- Target launch: mid-September 2025 (pushed from post-Labor Day)
	- Vinod has design background beyond engineering, handling UX development
- Target market segments: brokers, investors, consultants, appraisers, lenders, loan servicers
	- Berkadia loan servicing and lending teams previously expressed strong interest
	- Strategy to go deep in hospitality rather than broad across asset classes

### Funding, Beta Testing & Marketing Needs

- Funding pipeline secured: $50k committed investor (patent attorney/board advisor), $100k informal commitment
- Company formation in progress: LLC paperwork under review, no bank account yet
- CBRE (largest commercial real estate firm) committed business analysts for beta testing
	- Strategy: land CBRE as anchor client to simplify future sales (“this is what CBRE uses”)
	- Additional smaller groups interested in testing participation
- Marketing support needed for industry conferences and client meetings:
	- PowerPoint presentations for prospect meetings
	- Conference handouts and materials
	- Website optimization and consultation
	- Mark/Diane will handle sales through personal networks, not formal sales team initially
- Current team working without compensation except offshore developers (funded by Mark/Drew personal investment)
- Howard interested in Carrie joining as growth marketer (hourly consulting transitioning to equity partnership)
