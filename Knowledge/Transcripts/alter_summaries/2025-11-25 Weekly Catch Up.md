### Top of mind

- Need to clarify position on continuing with Mark and Drew in InnVestAI partnership
	- LLC signing deadline is tonight at 5:30 PM call
	- Cannot work with Mark anymore due to trust issues and lack of collaboration
	- Drew also lost trust by supporting Mark’s position to make you non-voting founder
- Mark Woodworth call at 11:00 AM presents major opportunity
	- Could partner on 8,000 hotel data set from CBRE shutdown
	- Potential revenue split arrangement for earlier monetization
	- Need to emphasize 90% success rate on data extraction and Excel model replication in SaaS

### Updates and wins

- Lender model documentation 99% complete
	- Drew and Vinod still reviewing before sending to developers
	- Includes all different inputs and five KPI cards switched to lender-specific
	- Developers have enough to get started on implementation
- Financial runway secured for immediate needs
	- Will deposit full $12,500 next month (keeping couple thousand for living expenses)
	- Enough to cover software engineers, hosting costs, and tools through December
	- Brax credit card option available with $2,500 balance requirement
- Backup funding option through Sherben
	- Still willing to invest $50-60k despite previous issues
	- Would allow paying back Drew and Mark completely
	- Comes with attorney expertise as fractional GC

### Challenges and blockers

- Partnership dissolution imminent
	- Mark accused of fraud via email (clarified as perception issue, not actual accusation)
	- Mark and Drew attempted to make you non-voting founder while retaining equity
	- Drew stopped collaborating and won’t put more expenses on credit card
	- No staff funds available to pay $6,000 December payroll without immediate action
- Mark Woodworth opportunity timing conflict
	- Major partnership discussion happening same day as LLC crisis
	- Need to focus on replicating Excel model success story and 90% data extraction rate
	- Jack Cordial (economist, early 70s) requires Howard to lead presentations due to generational preferences

### Mutual feedback

- You expressed frustration about being pushed out of business decisions
	- “Too many cooks in the kitchen” - want collaborative leadership model
	- Mark and Drew “taking over” instead of collaborating as equals
- Howard confirmed support for your leadership position
	- “This is your company, you’re the CEO”
	- Disagreed with Mark/Drew suggestion to make you non-voting member
	- Both Howard and Vinod aligned on continuing without Mark/Drew if needed
- Acknowledged parenting challenges discussion
	- Generation X vs current parenting styles comparison
	- Importance of teaching self-sufficiency vs always rescuing children

### Next Milestone

- Tonight’s 5:30 PM call strategy
	- State that LLC issues surfaced collaboration problems among founders
	- Decline to sign LLC due to inability to work with Mark and Drew
	- Keep discussion brief, defer settlement negotiations until after Thanksgiving
- Settlement approach planning
	- Propose paying back loans plus 5% interest as starting point
	- Include non-disparagement clause in separation agreement
	- Let Sherben handle legal language and structure
- Mark Woodworth partnership focus
	- Emphasize Excel model replication in SaaS platform
	- Highlight 90% success rate with AI data extraction
	- Position as partnership to save 8,000 hotel “unspun gold” data set
	- Discuss revenue split model and shared engineering costs
