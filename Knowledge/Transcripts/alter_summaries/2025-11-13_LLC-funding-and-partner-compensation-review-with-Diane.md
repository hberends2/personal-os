### Driftwood Investment Terms Clarification

- Howard’s compensation: $8,500/month for 6 months from $75k Driftwood safe note
	- Originally discussed in Drew’s budget presentations (referenced in recordings)
	- Driftwood aware of allocation via prior email documentation
	- Not sufficient for Howard to quit Kroger - survival-level compensation only
- Remaining allocation breakdown:
	- $12,500/month total available
	- $4,000 remainder for other payroll/software engineering costs
	- Leaves $24,000 vs $67,000 working capital depending on interpretation
- Documentation requirements:
	- Team needs written confirmation from Driftwood on fund allocation
	- Email format acceptable (formal agreement not required)
	- Timeline: within 4 weeks during their budget season

### Team Dynamics and Future Structure

- Howard’s position on current partners:
	- Wants Mark removed - “not adding value, making situation worse”
	- No tangible business development or fundraising contributions from Mark
	- Pitch deck incomplete, missing 40% of required content
	- Drew valuable but becoming negatively influenced by Mark’s “dramatics”
- Preferred path forward:
	- Four-person LLC: Howard, team member, Vinod, potentially Drew
	- Mark exit before LLC signing to avoid “divorce” complications
	- Delay LLC execution until December due to budget season timing
- Competitive concerns about Drew’s separate company (Profit Sword):
	- Pilot with Rock Bridge hotel investment company
	- Potential overlap with InnVestAI’s asset management focus
	- Current LLC draft allows competing interests - problematic clause

### Fundraising Strategy Gap

- Critical need for additional safe note investors beyond Driftwood
	- Target: $150k secured for Vinod to feel comfortable leaving current job
	- Mark has contributed nothing to investor pipeline
	- Team lacks coordinated fundraising plan or strategy
- Revenue timeline uncertainty:
	- Customer revenue may take 3-6 months even with current prospects
	- Bootstrap approach was never Howard’s intention
	- Need sustainable funding before operational hiring

### Legal and Operational Concerns

- LLC formation complications:
	- Super majority approval required for all fundraising (bypassed with Driftwood)
	- Potential audit/future investor scrutiny of compensation arrangements
	- Mark’s nine unresolved items mostly non-blocking for LLC execution
- IP and entity considerations:
	- Current InnVestAI entity could continue without LLC if needed
	- Website, name rights secured regardless of LLC status
	- Potential clean start with new EIN if Mark creates legal complications

### Budget Reality and Cash Flow

- Current financial projections show negative $98,644 cash balance by January
- Includes $75k Driftwood investment and $15k from other sources
- Salary deferrals previously agreed by Mark and Drew due to financial constraints
- Monthly burn rate concerns if Howard takes full proposed compensation
