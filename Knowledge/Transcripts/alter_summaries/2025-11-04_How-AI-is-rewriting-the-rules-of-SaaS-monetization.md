### AI’s Impact on SaaS Monetization Evolution

- AI wave represents fundamental shift in software pricing/packaging
- Similar to perpetual → SaaS transition but faster and more strategic
- Every platform epoch requires rethinking value delivery and billing models
- Business model changes cut through entire organization: go-to-market, sales comp, feature valuation

### Why Usage-Based Billing is Strategic for AI

- AI creates 4+ orders of magnitude cost reduction (example: Pixar image creation $100 → 0.01¢)
- Direct value-to-cost alignment unlike seat-based models
- Clear dislocation between traditional pricing and AI capability value
- Enables strategic distribution vs. margin decisions at board level
- Companies can segment profitable enterprise tiers while subsidizing growth tiers

### Customer Acquisition vs. Retention Dynamics

- AI solves customer acquisition problem through inherent product magic
- Users will engage with basic AI implementations because technology is compelling
- Real challenge shifted to retention and defensibility
- Companies moving from acquisition focus to post-purchase expansion
- Brand moats developing faster due to rapid market growth and consumer awareness

### Financial Operations Integration

- Finance pulled into product phase for first time in industry history
- Engineers now have cost dashboards and understand P&L impact
- Feature development includes margin analysis from engineering teams
- CFOs younger, more strategic, managing both upside and downside
- Finance became mini-CEO role rather than traditional risk mitigation

### Enterprise vs. Consumer AI Adoption

- Clear proof points: creative tools, coding assistance, emotional connection products working
- Language reasoning tasks highly successful
- Enterprise implementations often fail due to top-down mandates without user behavior change
- Real adoption remains user-driven, secular phenomenon
- Traditional enterprise buying patterns don’t apply to AI tools

### Organizational Transformation Requirements

- Post-sales teams most in-demand due to expansion economics
- Contract negotiation starts after contract signing (consumption focus)
- Sales compensation, customer success, organizational design all require updates
- Product strategy directly tied to monetization model
- Traditional pre-sales vs. post-sales boundaries blurring

### Incumbent Company Strategy

- Start small but with conviction - don’t boil the ocean
- Launch AI-native products as $0 products, treat like startup within company
- Plan 3-5 year transition timeline for existing revenue streams
- Deputize senior leader with CEO/board backing for transformation
- Avoid zero-sum thinking - AI adds new capabilities rather than replacing everything
