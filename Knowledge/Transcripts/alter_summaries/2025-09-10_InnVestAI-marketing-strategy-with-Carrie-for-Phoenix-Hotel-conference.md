### Meeting Introductions

- Mark Gordon - InnVestAI team
	- 30+ years hotel industry experience
	- 20 years advisory (raising capital for hotels)
	- Hotel developer in New York
	- Active hotel/hotel tech investor
	- Working with team for ~6 months
- Carrie (former redIQ intern) brought in part-time for marketing support
	- Strong marketing/go-to-market background
	- Familiar with real estate terminology from redIQ experience

### InnVestAI Positioning Challenge

- Platform does 10-15 different functions (eventually)
	- All-encompassing solution vs. competitors who do 1-2 things
	- Difficult to explain comprehensive scope in comparisons
- Target audience spans 40+ year age range
	- Need message for both junior analysts and senior decision-makers
	- Industry historically averse to new technology
	- Still using same analytics methods from late 90s
- Challenge: Getting people comfortable changing familiar processes
	- Like convincing people to try Uber vs. traditional taxi

### Phoenix Hotel Conference Preparation

- October 6-8, Mark attending solo
- 3,000 attendees: users, investors, cross-section of industry
- Immediate needs:
	- One-pager explaining current product + 36-month vision
	- Follow-up email template for post-conversation outreach
	- Business cards (traditional approach preferred)
- Conference strategy: dozens of conversations, immediate follow-up emails to maintain momentum

- One-pager creation pending:
	- Team summary deck (10-12 pages) ready by Tuesday/Wednesday
