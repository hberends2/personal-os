### Project Status and Acceleration Strategy

- Team is moving slower than desired on development
- Howard and colleague exploring options to accelerate development pace
- Considered intern option but decided against it due to:
	- Current lack of organization
	- Would require more supervision time than value added
	- Cannot offer payment currently

### Potential Technical Partner Discussion

- Identified Somya Saha from Arcadia as potential technical partner
	- Strong architect with full-stack capabilities (data, tech, coding)
	- Previous successful collaboration with Howard on deal accelerator project
	- Known for thorough questioning and quality deliverables
- Next steps:
	- Have initial discussion between current partners before approaching Somya
	- Explore partnership structure since paid position not currently possible
	- Consider timing of approach

### POC Development Updates

- Current state:
	- UI prototype functional with accurate calculations
	- Using browser storage (non-persistent)
	- No authentication system in place
	- Need to add: taxes, insurance, penetration metrics
	- Drew suggested adding capital expenditure section
- Implementation plan:
	- Will use GitHub + Superbase connection
	- Can deploy current version for demo purposes
	- No immediate need for data persistence during testing phase
	- Will create universal test user for demos

### Administrative Planning

- NDA Development:
	- Howard drafted standard NDA under personal name
	- Temporary solution until InvestAI becomes legal entity
	- Critical for protecting IP during client advisory board discussions
- Outstanding Items:
	- Pricing strategy needed
	- Sales process definition
	- Client service structure
	- Feature planning and prioritization
	- Using Jira idea board (free version) for feature tracking
