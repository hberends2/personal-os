### Product Development Status & Priorities

- POC status: Currently functional but requires fine-tuning
- MVP requirements identified:
	- User signup with terms/conditions (NDA acceptable for friends/family testing)
	- Document processing system integration with Drew’s existing system
	- Data persistence and basic database functionality
	- User/account management structure similar to Procadia model
- Disagreement on SSO requirement:
	- Not required for MVP
	- Will be needed for Version 1 release
- Meeting scheduled with Vinod and Drew at 5pm to discuss document routing

### Technology & AI Strategy

- Current AI positioning challenges:
	- Mark wants extensive AI features before investor demos
	- Team perspective: AI should be invisible/backend focused
	- Recommendation: Position AI features as add-ons
- Key selling points to emphasize:
	- Speed improvements over Excel
	- Accuracy and reliability
	- Automated processing vs. chat interface
- Procadia consideration: Will not use external AI systems
