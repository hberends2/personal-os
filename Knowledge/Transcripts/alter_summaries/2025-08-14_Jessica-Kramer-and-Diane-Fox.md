	- Bridge to best-in-class tech solutions development
	- Bridge to hospitality industry for customer testing and partnerships
- “Put our hand on the scale” for founders through network access
- Consulting business prioritizes early-stage founders over well-funded larger players

	- Document processing expertise: drag-and-drop financial statements/rent roll extraction

### Market Problem & Red IQ Lessons

- Howard’s Red IQ dominated multifamily AVM market with 60% share
	- Clients included Walker & Dunlop, CBRE, JLL, major brokerages
	- Robust document processing: handled Yardi, MRI, Trata, RealPage formats
	- Berkadia acquisition 2017 for internal teams and broker valuations
	- “Worst kept secret” - competitors still used despite Berkadia ownership
- Red IQ’s downfall: Radix acquisition and pivot disaster
	- Radix caught in RealPage class action suit, pulled engineers off Red IQ
	- January decision to keep only 2 engineers, mass layoffs
	- Competitors leapfrogged with AI while Red IQ stayed rules-based
- Howard’s hotel industry revelation: “I could not find anything like this in hospitality”
	- More standardization in hotel financials vs. multifamily
	- Unique forward-looking data opportunity vs. historical-only competitors

### Technology Architecture & Data Strategy

- Drew’s standardized data aggregation across 50+ operators using USALI framework
	- Very granular P&L data: line-item costs, housekeeping hours
	- Actual/budget/forecast/pro forma integration
	- Side-by-side comparison across brands (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt) and operators (Aimbridge, HEI, Davidson)
- Howard’s Gen AI experimentation: Costa Mesa hotel case study
	- Accurate historical data extraction from minimal input
	- Tax information, previous ownership history, public records aggregation
- MVP design philosophy: replicate Excel workflows exactly
	- Demo feedback: “this is exactly what we do in Excel” - intentional success
	- No learning curve for underwriters familiar with market penetration analysis
- Forward-looking data advantage: underwriting deals vs. competitors’ historical focus

### Business Model Three-Phase Strategy

- Phase 1: Workflow automation
	- Pipeline management and AVM software (75% complete MVP)
	- Target: debt/structured finance (high volume, 30% hotel loans due 2026)
- Phase 2: Data monetization
	- Aggregation and anonymization of forward-looking market data
	- Hot markets identification, cap rate trends, property type demand
	- Unique dataset: users underwriting future deals vs. historical financials
- Phase 3: Marketplace development
	- Following VTS playbook (CBRE’s $25M investment choice over Costar)
	- Platform where hotels transact, not just analyze
- Target: $100M ARR over 5-7 years in $2B annual fee industry

### Go-to-Market & Customer Strategy

- Debt/structured finance entry point rationale:
	- High-level underwriting, high volumes
	- 30% of hotel loans maturing 2026 creating immediate demand
	- 2-3 leading lenders already in conversation
- Multi-persona approach: brokers, lenders, asset managers, owners, appraisers
	- Mark’s network advantage: decades of industry relationships
	- “Very incestuous little club” - relationships = 75% of adoption battle
- Design partner strategy over traditional sales approach
	- Deep 6-month working relationships with key personas
	- Real usage feedback vs. superficial “this is cool” responses

### Fundraising Strategy & Capital Structure

- Friends & family raise: 4-10 people writing small checks for working capital
	- Team working unpaid for 9 months, need “livable wage” not industry-standard salaries
	- Build-by-partner strategy minimizes hiring needs
- Planned hires: fractional CFO, AI partnerships, minimal additional engineering
	- Mark/Diane handle sales internally
	- Drew covers data requirements
	- Possible marketing hire and adjacent consulting business
- Jessica’s venture capital concerns:
	- Senior team burn rate will face VC pushback
	- Need financial modeling: customers needed for profitability vs. capital for scaling
	- Industry capital (Art Adler, Bob Webster, asset managers) may be better fit than generalist VC

### Jessica’s Strategic Recommendations

- Design partnerships priority: 2-3 committed companies across different personas
	- 6-month working relationships, not just advisory feedback
	- Free software in exchange for deep customization input
	- Howard’s role: ensure customizations are universally applicable
- Community-led growth for junior analysts/associates
	- Free access creating internal advocates who push bosses to purchase
	- Engineering-led growth model reference (Twilio text messaging integration)
- Board vs. advisory committee distinction:
	- Senior advisory: Bob Webster, Mitchell, Steve Angels, Ellen Brown types
	- Board: committed people reporting results, guiding business decisions
	- Junior community: actual end-users providing evangelism
