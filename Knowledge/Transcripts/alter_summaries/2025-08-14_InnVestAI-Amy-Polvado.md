### Diane’s Background & InnVestAI Vision

- 25 years commercial real estate experience specializing in hospitality
	- Institutional investments, acquisitions, asset management, portfolio management
	- Worked with Jalil McCor on BI platforms at two companies (now runs Inhovate in Middle East)
	- 2 years at CBRE developing proposal for digital hospitality investment platform
		- Collaborated with Global Valuations software engineer and business analytics lead
		- Learned transition from closed to open systems requiring data integration
		- CBRE made $125M investment in VTS but hospitality wasn’t large enough sector
- Current founding team of 5:
	- Howard: Product management (ex-Red IQ/Berkadia)
	- Vinod: CTO (ex-Red IQ/Berkadia)
	- Mark Gordon: Hotel broker (Son of Looking Goldman, Cushman Wakefield), developer, tech investor
	- Drew Wallace: Management company data mapping specialist
- Product development: 25% through MVP on AWS, completed security sign-on, working on front-end AVM components
- Hospitality acquisition models unchanged since HVS in 1980s - desperately needs modernization

### Market Strategy & Customer Approach

- Entry strategy: Debt and structured finance (faster underwriting cycles, speed critical)
- Beta clients identified:
	- Peachtree Hotel Group (confirmed beta partner)
	- Access Point Financial (interested in beta)
- Revenue model: Target $2B annual fee industry across brokers, owners, lenders, appraisers, consultants
	- Goal: 30-50M ARR, potentially higher with solid workflows
- Unique positioning: Real estate investment focus vs operations-heavy existing hospitality tech
- 5-year vision: Virtual marketplace platform with automated data workflows, brokers retain relationship role

### Amy’s PropTech Council & Background

- Founded after frustration with lack of building performance data for investment alpha
- Started as commercial contractor, then private equity real estate (mixed use, some hospitality)
- Founded US PropTech Council - 450+ members (startups, universities, real estate companies, investors)
- Pivoted from multifamily to data centers due to better cash flow and faster adoption
- Digital twin technology: Data source requiring functionality layers for non-technical users
- Current products: Site selection tools, commercial transaction portal (contract to close)
- Bootstrap approach: 6 years, ~$50-60K total spend through partnerships and intern labor

### AI & Competitive Landscape

- AI disruption threat: Customers using ChatGPT/Claude for financial analysis
	- ChatGPT-5 increasingly powerful for workflows previously requiring custom development
	- Customer objection: “Why do we need you when we can do this ourselves?”
- Defensive strategies:
	- Proprietary data that AI models can’t access
	- Superior algorithms vs generic AI responses
	- Target regional players (Patels, smaller operators) vs institutional giants with analyst teams
- Hospitality data complexity: Getting to NOI line requires specialized industry knowledge
- Current competitors lack underwriting capabilities (focused on CRM/pipeline management)
- Integration recommendation: Build LLM integrations now rather than custom development

### Fundraising Reality & Business Development

- September pre-seed target: $300-400K for 6-8 months runway
- VC landscape changed dramatically: Revenue/contracts required, no more idea-stage funding
- Contract strategy critical:
	- Sign beta customers to actual contracts (paper = gold)
	- Structure as full annual value ($100K) with discount line items for early customers
	- Accounting trick: Show full contract value as revenue, discount as separate line
- Bootstrap recommendation: Extend runway another year for better valuation/investor environment
- Collaboration opportunities:
	- InnVestAI join PropTech Council ($49/month or $499/year)
	- Amy champion hospitality sector within council (currently missing vertical)
	- Digital twin applications for hotel brand development (dormant now due to interest rates)
	- Carbon footprint tracking integration (meeting planners making decisions based on sustainability)
- Partnership potential: Amy’s contact Mike (fractional CTO consultant) for tech stack connectivity vision
