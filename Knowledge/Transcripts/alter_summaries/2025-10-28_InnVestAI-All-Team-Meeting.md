### Challenges and Adjustments Needed

- Feedback tracking system inadequate

	- Team members unsure if previously reported bugs were addressed
	- Risk of duplicate reporting and missing critical fixes
- Year zero timing complexity for end-of-year acquisitions
	- Properties purchased in January/February create “year zero” confusion
	- Need to address partial year calculations vs full year projections
- Demo preparation requires field requirement adjustments
	- Deal details form needs non-required fields for smoother demo flow
