### LLC Operating Agreement Review

- Drew reviewed operating agreement with Mike Sherbin’s (attorney/patent engineer) initial feedback
- Key areas identified for clarification:
	- Hotel business carve-out language needs strengthening
		- Current wording too broad for competing business protections
		- Added Drew’s HotelBiz specifically as carved-out existing business
		- Need additional clause prohibiting new competitive businesses post-formation
	- Competing business protections require refinement
		- Existing carve-out only protects current businesses
		- Missing protection against starting/joining new competitive ventures
	- Major decision thresholds need restructuring
		- Conflicting language between meeting requirements and action thresholds
		- Some items listed under both supermajority and unanimous consent

### Capital Contributions & Accounting

- No separate bank accounts required for capital contributions
- Individual capital accounts tracked through QuickBooks GL accounts
	- Each founder gets separate GL capital account for tracking
	- All contributions flow into single corporate bank account
- Capital tracking only relevant for eventual sale/capital gains calculations
	- Tracks individual investment vs. gains on exit

### Vesting Schedule Discussion

- Current draft applies vesting to all founders equally
- Mike recommends vesting schedules to maintain founder engagement
	- Prevents scenarios where inactive founders retain full equity
	- Example: founder leaves early but retains full 20% in $100M company
	- Tool to keep founders participating over time
- Howard suggested alternative: front-loading approach
	- 40% vesting year one, extend to year five total
	- More founder-friendly than traditional linear vesting
- Open question: apply to all founders or just new members

### Management Structure & Decision Making

- Current agreement has conflicting language between supermajority and unanimous consent requirements
- Mike’s recommended structure:
	- Quorum: majority of members (3 of 5) for meetings
	- Most major decisions: supermajority (4 of 5)
	- Avoid unanimous requirements to prevent single-person vetoes
	- Bankruptcy decisions may resolve automatically based on cash flow
- Delegation authority policy needed for operational decisions
	- Similar to corporate policies: CFO authority up to $300K, CEO up to $1M
	- Prevents need for board approval on routine purchases (laptops, software)
	- Contract signing authority and dollar limits need definition
	- Howard joked: “Product team requires Aston Martin”
- Founder roles schedule to be added as exhibit
	- Clear delineation of responsibilities and decision-making authority
	- Reduce administrative burden as company scales

### Founder Compensation Framework

- Different economic circumstances creating internal tension
	- Some founders have full-time jobs, others don’t
	- Some need immediate income, others can defer
	- Contentious issue requiring resolution
- Mike’s recommended approach:
	- Pay working founders as 1099 contractors (not W2 employees initially)
	- Avoids payroll complications, workers comp, withholding taxes
	- Company pays gross amount, contractor handles own taxes
	- Compensation separate from equity ownership - no dilution
- Compensation philosophy:
	- Low baseline salaries focused on allowing full-time focus
	- Enable faster company growth benefiting all equity holders
	- Working founders still receive equal owner draws when available
	- Raises tied to revenue generation, not arbitrary increases
- Compensation decisions require supermajority approval
- Alternative loan structure mentioned but not recommended

### Current Founder Work Distribution

- Howard: 40+ hours/week for nearly a year (unpaid)
	- Working full-time without other job
	- Needs compensation to continue focus
- Drew: Significant time while balancing two jobs
	- Approximately 10-15 hours/week on InnVestAI
	- Currently doesn’t need salary
- Diane: 5+ years development, substantial current contribution
	- Working without other full-time commitment
	- Emotional about compensation equity given investment
- Vinod: Limited by full-time job, critical for MVP completion
	- Burning out managing software team in India plus full-time job
	- Company stalling without his full-time focus
	- Key bottleneck for MVP completion
- Mark: Least contribution but valuable industry connections
	- Has own company, works nearly full-time on that
	- Critical for customer introductions and growth
	- Most resistant to founder compensation

### Fundraising Strategy & Valuation Tensions

- Proposed SAFE notes with $5M post-money valuation cap
- Mike’s perspective: $5M too high for pre-revenue company
	- Referenced Apple’s initial $750K valuation (Mike Markkula invested $250K for 1/3)
	- Y Combinator winners typically valued at $1.5M
	- As potential investor, wouldn’t invest at $5M valuation
	- Early investors should get better terms than later rounds
- Diane’s counter-argument:
	- Hospitality tech companies like Paraview achieved $30-50M Series A valuations
	- Comparable company (Drew’s partner) currently at $82M ARR
	- $5M cap prevents excessive dilution in early rounds
	- Example: $50K investments at lower caps could dilute 50% for only $250K raised
- SAFE note mechanics clarified:
	- No immediate dilution - converts at future valuation round
	- If Series A valuation lower than cap, SAFE investors get more equity
	- Valuation caps can vary between different SAFE note investors
- Strategic approach: multiple SAFE rounds with increasing valuation caps

### Tax Implications & Owner Draws

- LLC taxation explained: pass-through entity
- Founders taxed on company profits regardless of distributions
	- Example: $100K profit = $20K taxable income per 20% owner
	- Must pay estimated quarterly taxes even if no money drawn
- Owner draws vs. compensation distinction:
	- Owner draws: equal distribution of profits, not tax deductible
	- Compensation: payment for work, reduces company taxable income
- ESOP example: owners can be both equity holders and W2 employees

### Strategic Vision Alignment Needed

- Critical discussion required on exit strategy and growth ambitions
- Mike’s key question: Would team accept $20M buyout offer?
	- Tests alignment on growth vs. quick exit preferences
	- Predicts future fundraising vs. bootstrapping decisions
- Growth philosophy tensions:
	- Diane: Aims for $100M ARR over 5 years, multiple funding rounds
	- Howard: Prefers bootstrapping, views fundraising as “getting a loan”
	- Mike: Recommends stop at Series A, grow with revenue
- Risk of misaligned visions:
	- Investors may view as red flag
	- Could attract predatory buyouts exploiting founder disagreements
- Exit strategy mechanisms needed:
	- Right of first refusal if founder wants to sell
	- Buyout provisions for different growth preferences
	- Independent valuation process for disputes

### Additional Legal Protections

- Right of first refusal clause needed
	- Prevents founders from selling to external parties without offering to team
	- Protects against unwanted third-party involvement
- Divorce/death protections suggested
	- Family members get economic benefit but not voting rights
	- Company option to buy out inherited/divorced stakes
- Drag-along rights for future consideration
	- Prevents minority shareholders from blocking major sales
	- Typically added during Series A with institutional investors
