### Budget Overview for MVP Development

- Monthly costs breakdown provided
	- Fixed subscriptions: minimal compared to development costs
	- Variable costs: offshore development team ($800/month for 2 developers)
	- Total estimated: ~$12,000 over 6 months to reach MVP
- Current timeline: MVP ready by September (not December as initially implied)
	- December timeline was monthly cost projection, not development duration
	- Labor Day target discussed as aggressive goal (6 weeks from current date)

### Development Team Scaling

- Two Indian developers identified and ready to start Monday
	- Both available full-time at $400/month each
	- One has 2+ years experience, other close to 2 years
	- Both known personally by Vinod, proven capabilities
- Third senior developer being sourced
	- Would accelerate timeline from 2-3 months to potentially 1.5 months
	- Additional $400-800/month for more experienced resource
- Team structure: Vinod to manage and onboard developers over weekend

### MVP Feature Scope (Drew’s Email Requirements)

- Core features locked in:
	- Deal summary generation (PDF export, email-ready format)
	- AI market research (competitive analysis, demand generators, area overview)
	- P&L data extraction from uploaded documents
	- Non-financial document processing (contracts, permits, licenses)
- Additional consideration: Future supply analysis in markets
	- New construction tracking
	- Demand generation monitoring
	- Could integrate with market research feature

### Infrastructure & Operations Setup

	- Basic $10/month licenses sufficient for developers
	- Howard to check existing subscription capacity
- Banking setup (Vinod leading)
	- Novo bank account to be established Monday
	- Mark to get access for deposits
	- Remitly for international payments to developers
- Azure account setup required
	- Drew’s credit card for initial setup
	- Company account transition planned

### Lark Data Partnership Discussion

- Ryan/Dan Lesser relationship strategy
	- Two-level approach: Drew contacts Ryan, Mark contacts Dan
	- Dan Lesser must be included (decision maker)
	- Potential for free data access for existing Lark customers
- Customer overlap identified
	- Lark customer list includes: First Hospitality, KFL, Stockdale, Electra, Park Hotels, Davidson, Hilton, Ashford, Remington, and many others
	- Pay-per-use model preferred over markup approach
	- Small transaction fees ($199) easier to approve than $30k annual subscriptions

### Peachtree Hotel Group Opportunity

- Brian lunch meeting outcome (Drew’s contact)
	- Interested in debt and structured finance pilot
	- $150k budget mentioned (6-month timeline)
	- Greg has industry influence and LinkedIn presence
- Requirements for Peachtree engagement
	- Need accurate IRR and return calculations
	- Debt metrics essential (LTV, debt service coverage)
	- Market data critical for their process
- Positioning advantages
	- No current underwriting solutions pitched to them
	- Prefer in-house systems over existing asset management tools
	- Data transfer easier for refinancing vs. sales

### Strategic Focus & Timeline Pressure

- Competitive concerns raised
	- Team actively discussing ideas with industry contacts
	- Risk of building competition through idea sharing
	- Urgency to deliver product before ideas spread
- Market timing considerations
	- Capital markets return after Labor Day
	- Six-week window to Labor Day identified as key milestone
	- August typically slow period for industry
