### Announcements

- Diane expects to receive LLC document review feedback by this weekend, with simultaneous team review as backup if she cannot complete it
- Carlos meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 5:00 PM (he is traveling this week)
- Safe note documentation has been received and filed with November 1st date

### Review of Progress

- Year Zero development work is in progress and expected completion by end of this week
- Map functionality should be completed by tomorrow or day after
- Staging environment testing is ongoing with active formulas now implemented
- EBITDA and NOI calculation testing still needed for input sections
- Demo preparation timeline established for week of November 17th for outreach to schedule early December meetings

### Key Achievements

- Active formulas are now working in the system for calculation cards
- Basic loan monitoring framework has been developed with debt service coverage ratio and debt yield calculations
- Investment assumptions modal interface completed, providing more intuitive user flow than previous navigation system
- Loan portfolio summary view capability identified as key differentiator from competitors

### Challenges and Adjustments Needed

- Competitive pressure from Michelle Russo’s single pane platform, which has secured major clients including Trinity and KS with approximately 20 customers
- Single pane pricing model ($400-500 per hotel per month) creates cost barrier for Access Point Financial’s 200-300 hotel portfolio (approximately $1.5M annually)
- Need to distinguish InnVestAI from monitoring-only competitors by offering both underwriting and monitoring capabilities
- Technical challenge of integrating appraisal data and processes into the platform while maintaining appraiser independence requirements
- Time management constraint requiring focus on monitoring functionality first, then underwriting module within 60 days

### Action Items and Accountability for the Week Ahead

- Howard: Complete testing of input sections and EBITDA/NOI calculations in staging environment
- Howard: Continue addressing feedback items provided Tuesday for system improvements
- Mark: Share customer outreach list early next week for December demo scheduling
- Team: Develop demo script and conduct practice runs during week of November 17th
- Team: Decide on demo format (live vs. pre-recorded video) and participant structure for customer presentations
- Diane: Complete LLC document review this weekend or notify team for simultaneous review process
- Consider implementing borrower loan request submission directly through InnVestAI platform to attract new customers and improve lender efficiency
