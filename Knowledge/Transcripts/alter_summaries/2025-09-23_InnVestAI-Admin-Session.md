### Product Development & Canvas Tool Success

- First successful use of Gemini AI canvas tool for creating sales infographic
	- Generated comprehensive one-page visual from Mark’s outline
	- Not designed for printing but for web embedding/email links
	- Potential for feature-specific infographics with clickable elements
- Roadmap updated with cleaner, short-term focus through end of 2027
	- Color-coded by phase for clarity
	- Ready to share with Carlos Rodriguez Jr. alongside safe note

### Fundraising Strategy & Investor Relations

- Mark’s October 6th conference presentation as key milestone
	- First public “coming out” moment for the company
	- Need for more proactive collaboration on customer targeting and fundraising approach
- Mike Sherman investment discussions
	- $50k investment at $5M pre-money valuation preferred
	- 10% equity for $50k considered unacceptable given team’s work investment
	- 3-5% equity range more appropriate for that investment level
- Friends and family funding pool as potential solution
- Target: $1M raised over next 12-18 months
- Industry connections valuable for initial funding, but Series A will require broader investor base
	- Marriott/Hilton could provide $500k+ given minimal impact to their budgets
	- Focus on proving product value before approaching major hotel chains

### Equity Structure & Team Dynamics Concerns

- Current 5-person equal 20% split facing challenges
	- Drew working 10-15 hours/week, stating “more than I wanted to”
	- Mark not incentivized for fundraising despite industry connections
	- Questioning fairness of equal equity for unequal time commitment
- Potential restructuring options discussed
	- Convert some founders to paid employees to enable salary payments
	- Performance-based equity with commission structure for Mark on funds raised (10% suggested)
	- Springing equity tied to full-time commitment
- Drew’s HotelBIS business considerations
	- Has key man provision requiring full-time work at Actus
	- Risk of COO title conflict with existing obligations
	- Merger possibility if HotelBIS integrates with InnVestAI
- LLC documentation still pending, allowing for structure modifications
- Major decision-making process needs clarification to prevent single-person vetoes
