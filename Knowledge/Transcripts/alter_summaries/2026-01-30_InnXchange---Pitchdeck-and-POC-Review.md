### Pitch Deck Development

- Diane completed first draft using Pop AI framework
	- Built from scratch, avoided previous Drew/Mark work
	- Positioned as “AI-powered operating system for hotel real estate investments”
	- Combines DealPath + RedIQ + Paraview functionality
- Market sizing: $57.4B global transaction volume (2024), projected $178B by 2034
- Competitive analysis includes Bridge (debt-focused), single-point solutions
- Four-phase revenue model: SaaS → Enterprise → Marketplace → Transaction management

### Key Pitch Deck Feedback

- Remove Claude/Excel references entirely
	- Not direct threat to core platform value
	- Avoid drawing attention to well-funded competitors
- Adjust user projections from 6 to 4 users per client (based on Archer data)
- Add 24-month revenue projection to show $1M+ ARR milestone
- Increase font sizes, fix layout spacing issues
- Add marketplace component before transaction management phase

### Missing Marketplace Strategy

- Critical gap identified: marketplace must precede transaction management
- Functionality requirements:
	- Investor profiles with investment criteria
	- Automated deal matching and notifications
	- Embedded confidentiality agreements and LOI templates
	- Direct broker-investor interaction within platform
- Significant automated revenue potential
- Eliminates manual email processes for deal distribution

### Revenue Model Refinements

- Lighthouse client approach: 3 clients by month 9, 10 by month 18
- Pricing: $14K per user annually (4 users average per client)
- Enterprise path: 30 users at $20K each = $600K ARR
- Transaction management: 10 bips on AUM, 10% market share = $5-10M ARR potential

### Strategic Partnerships & Fundraising

- Sloan Dean call Feb 3: networking for industry introductions
- Target: Ben Rafter introduction (Hotel Equities CEO, startup background)
	- Hotel Equities uses Otellier (potential data partnership)
- Funding ask: $1.2M over 18 months
	- $520K people/payroll
	- Focus on strategic partnerships vs building everything in-house
- Uncle providing SaaS GTM expertise and deck refinement
