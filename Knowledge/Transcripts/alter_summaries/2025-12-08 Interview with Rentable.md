### Howard’s Career Journey

- 25+ year relationship with Jerry Davis, former ConService client before joining product side
- Asset management foundation at BH Management Services (VP level)
	- Implemented largest national utility management system with Jerry Davis/NWP
	- Strong analytical reputation in budgeting and financial review
- RealPage central reporting project: first consolidated database across acquired products
	- Addressed siloed data from growth-through-acquisition business model
	- “Got bit by the tech bug” during this transition
- AUM multi-year tenure: energy management analytics, consolidated custom reports
	- Forced departure due to Chicago relocation ultimatum and new COO’s anti-remote stance
	- Team that hired Howard was eliminated, Howard survived 18 months longer
- ConService brief return (pandemic hire): individual contributor role, significant pay cut
- RedIQ 2+ years as Senior Director of Product Management
	- Direct reports: product owners and dotted-line product managers
	- Major achievement: Lifecycle Management Suite (2-year project, 1.5 years development)
		- Expanded RedIQ from acquisition-only to full asset lifecycle usage

	- Led expansion into single family rentals and student housing
	- Demographic and risk data integration with Berkadia data science team
		- Fire risk, earthquake risk, employment data for investment decisions
		- Available throughout asset lifecycle, not just acquisition
- Berkadia organizational influence: introduced product-led growth process replacing Safe Agile
- January 2024 Radix acquisition circumstances:
	- Initially promising for data integration (acquisition data + operational data)
	- RealPage lawsuit complications diverted engineering resources to Radix pivot
	- Howard left with “skeleton crew” keeping lights on, no backlog development
	- CEO (Kosovo founder) shut down most RedIQ operations, offshored remaining development
	- January layoffs: 9 of 15-16 RedIQ employees eliminated, kept minimal staff
- Current consulting: hospitality valuation model project ending December 2024

### Product Management Philosophy & Approach

- Core definition: work with internal/external stakeholders to identify pain points, create solutions, identify complementary revenue-aligned product lines
- PM reputation management:
	- Common perception as roadblock to sales requests (especially when “Graystar asks, Graystar gets”)
	- Success through clear communication about feature applicability (single client vs all clients)
	- Never experienced contentious relationships with sales/stakeholders through honest prioritization explanations
- Last shipped features at RedIQ:
	- Student housing expansion
	- Demographic data integration (fire/earthquake risk, employment data)
	- Both completed in final sprint before shutdown
- “Four Horsemen” process innovation at Berkadia:
	- Early collaboration: PM, designer, architect, lead engineer
	- Surfaced and solved problems earlier than traditional handoff approach
	- Increased ticket output in shorter timeframes
	- Adopted organization-wide replacing Safe Agile linear processes
- Ideal role preference: Senior-level individual contributor with small team mentorship
	- Specifically wants to avoid VP-level administrative overhead
	- References RedIQ role as “perfect position” - senior director with direct reports but hands-on project leadership
- Technical capabilities expansion during consulting year:
	- Deep dive into no-code tools: Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Claude CLI
	- Built full-stack CRM (HubSpot knockoff) and roadmap product for current client
	- 24-hour prototype capability for various tools
	- Subscribes to 10+ daily AI newsletters, describes self as “AI fanboy”
	- Clear understanding of AI limitations alongside capabilities

### Technical & Process Details

- Apartment IQ technical environment:
	- Stack: Ruby, AWS, PostgreSQL, Redshift, React/React Native
	- Tools: Linear project management, AI tools (Granola note-taking, Gong)
	- Heavy prototyping culture using Lovable and other AI tools
- Howard’s process preferences:
	- Comfortable with ticket writing, acceptance criteria, Sprint planning involvement
	- Previous experience with product owners managing backlog/JIRA directly
	- Prefers Scrum-ban for smaller teams over strict Agile ceremonies
	- “Now, next, later” approach without story points/poker administrative overhead
- Apartment IQ process characteristics:
	- No traditional sprints, maintains standups and flexible planning meetings
	- Engineering team described as “fastest ever worked with”
	- Product team currently bottleneck (unusual vs typical engineering bottleneck)
	- Prioritization: impact and effort based, no formal ICE framework
	- Revenue-focused prioritization aligned with “lofty revenue goals”
- Howard’s anti-Safe Agile stance based on Berkadia experience with linear box-checking approach
