### Top of mind

- Mark and Drew are attempting to control customer calls and sales processes, excluding Diane from scheduling or joining calls
- LLC paperwork remains stalled with Diane citing being “too busy” to complete it until weekend, blocking company formation and ability to deposit revenue
- Need immediate clarification on Mark’s role - he expects to run sales team and have VP of sales report to him, which Howard strongly opposes
- Product model currently doesn’t work for lenders and needs immediate feedback from lender conversations to build proper output

### Updates and wins

- Driftwood client work progressing with Diane already working on their budgets
- UI/UX work largely completed and should be live on staging soon, including dashboard completion
- Resolved confusion with team member about year zero financial forecasting approach
- Made progress on monthly extraction requirements for partial-year financial statements

### Challenges and blockers

- Mark and Drew setting unauthorized rules about customer call participation without consulting team
- Offshore team lacks proper legal structure - no company registration, official pay accounts, benefits, or employment documentation
- Current product model sits between lender and investor needs but serves neither effectively
- Mark’s lack of software/SaaS knowledge makes him unsuitable for solo product demos
- Drew’s investor experience may not be typical - his harsh communication style based on “asshole investors” he worked with

### Mutual feedback

- Vinod reinforced previous advice that Mark is replaceable and shouldn’t have been included initially in decision-making roles
- Diane finally acknowledged that “there’s plenty of people that could replace Mark”
- Howard emphasized need to hire full-time VP of sales rather than rely on part-time employees controlling sales
- Team agreed Drew brings value through connections and partnerships, but Mark’s role should be limited to introductions and door-opening

### Next Milestone

- Howard to create two separate employee equity pools:
	- Early employees (Raj, Shiva, etc.): 0.3-0.75% equity
	- Senior hires (VP of sales, department leads): 3-5% equity
- Vinod to register private limited company in India as consultancy to provide proper legal structure for offshore team
- Howard finishing PRD updates today including:
	- Year-to-date clarification for financial statement columns
	- Adding Google Maps integration for pipeline deals and individual property locations
- Diane to schedule lender feedback calls despite Mark/Drew objections - positioned as product development need, not fundraising
- Address Mark’s role limitations before LLC signing - must agree to consultant role rather than management position
- VP of sales hire requirements: SaaS background, preferably SaaS + PropTech experience, direct report to Diane not Mark
