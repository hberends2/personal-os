### AI Strategy and Fundraising Insights

Diane’s Feedback Session

- Validated workflow approach - mirrors hospitality industry processes
- Strong endorsement for Excel-like workflow in cloud platform
- Key recommendations:
	- Focus on unstructured data opportunities
	- Web scraping for market intelligence (podcasts, reports)

Fundraising Approach

- Get angel investors first for POC completion
- Don’t need full AI implementation for Series A - roadmap sufficient
- Speed and automation are key selling points

### Upcoming Demo and Client Strategy

Tuesday Demo Preparation

- 10 AM Eastern with Ellen (Fulcrum)
- Ellen: ~60 years old, 35+ years hotel industry experience
- Focus on efficiency gains, not hotel basics
- Asset management pain points: fee compression, analyst-heavy processes
- Potential value prop: manage 10 hotels instead of 7

Presentation Strategy Differences

- Steve Angel (owner): focus on cost savings/profit impact
- Ellen (asset manager): focus on efficiency and career advancement
- Need different presentations based on audience level
