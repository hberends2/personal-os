### Company Status & Tech Stack

- Working with co-founders to define tech stack for MVP
- Balancing speed vs. foundation stability
	- Engineers want perfect foundation
	- Need to move fast and get customer feedback quickly
	- Accepting they’ll “trash” early versions to iterate faster
- Building something new that doesn’t exist in market
	- Solving existing problem with novel approach
	- Requires experimentation on property manager adoption

### Role Discussion & Expectations

- Jean seeking product co-founder/right-hand person
	- Not alone on product decisions
	- Has engineering team with financial platform background
	- Retired Treasury Manager (30 years real estate) as advisor
- Looking for complementary skills and cultural fit
	- Early stage requires comfort with chaos/uncertainty
	- 25% of 4-person team can’t be wrong fit
- Howard’s background aligns well
	- Rolling forecast experience at Bell Partners (top 10-50 property manager)
	- Zero-to-one startup comfort
	- VBA/Excel automation expertise directly applicable
- Compensation structure
	- Equity-only until seed funding (2-4 months timeline)
	- Market-rate salaries post-funding
	- Fair equity distribution for early contributors
	- 5-year commitment expectation

### Next Steps

- Jean will connect Howard with co-founder next week
- Howard to validate concept with former colleagues
	- Reach out to John Tomlinson (former CFO at Bell Partners)
	- Test 4-pillar solution: daily cash position, forecasting, liquidity risk, working capital optimization
	- Get 2-3 customer validation conversations
- Timeline: MVP in 1-2 months, seed round by month 4
