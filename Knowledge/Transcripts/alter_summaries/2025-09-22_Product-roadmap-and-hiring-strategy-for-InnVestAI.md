### Family & Work Balance

- Colleague’s 2-year-old son hospitalized with breathing difficulties
	- Required urgent care visit for respiratory issues
	- Diagnosed with cold in lungs, prescribed steroids and inhaler
	- Taking time off work to care for sick child
- Howard relates from personal experience with children’s respiratory issues
	- Both his children had similar group-type infections requiring rescue inhalers

### Product Development Status

- Multi-tab file processing currently unsupported
	- Single tab files now processing successfully according to feedback from team
	- Behind schedule due to family illness situation
	- Testing required for additional file formats
- Howard to finish roadmap (from original notes)
	- Shifted from 3-5 year planning to 1-year focus after leadership feedback
	- Mark sent draft one-pager for review
	- PowerPoint format temporary solution until proper roadmap tools implemented
- Platform technical details discussed
	- Save button functionality needed across all valuation tabs
	- Room count override capability required for hotel expansion scenarios
	- JIRA implementation pending access resolution through AWS migration
- 90-day development progress noted as strong given product complexity

### Hiring & Financial Priorities

- Product Manager role (Rajesh) timeline accelerated
	- Originally January 2026, moved to November 2025, potentially October 2025
	- Salary research revealed $52K annually (previously overestimated)
	- Howard’s concern about paying external hire before founders receive compensation
- Offshore team payment urgency
	- 3 developers at $400/month each ($1,200 total monthly)
	- Payment delays causing team retention risk
- Founder compensation debate
	- Strong preference to pay Howard before external product manager
	- Suggested title changes (SVP roles) to enable founder salaries while preserving equity
	- $75K investment from Diane’s consulting trade nearly confirmed
	- $50K from Mike under negotiation (pushing for lower valuation/higher equity)
- Decision to slow Rajesh hiring process until funding secured
