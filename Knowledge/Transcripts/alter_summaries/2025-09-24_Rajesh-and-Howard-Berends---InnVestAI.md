### Hotel Valuation Product Strategy

- Three-phase rollout approach
	- Lenders/appraisers - basic annual data only
	- Brokers/investors - detailed financial breakdowns
	- Asset managers - full monthly detail requirements
- Hotels use yearly analysis vs monthly (unlike multifamily)
	- Historical: 2022, 2023, 2024 data
	- Current: YTD statements with prorated projections
	- Forecasting: 2026+ based on holding period
- Market opportunity: no existing hotel valuation models in industry
	- Current tools equivalent to property management systems
	- Third-party data providers more cooperative than multifamily sector
- Competitive advantages over CoStar
	- Real-time data vs 3-5 day PDF delivery
	- $4,000 per report vs subscription model
	- Hotels are “drop in bucket” for CoStar - can fly under radar

### AI Development Timeline & Capabilities

- Agentic AI implementation moved up from 12-18 months to 6-12 months
- Planned AI agents for automated data collection:
	- Previous sale history
	- Tax records
	- Market data
	- Interest rates/loan terms
- Reverse engineering approach: input investment requirements first, then AI optimizes deal structure
- AI extraction progress ahead of schedule
	- 90 days of development = 9-12 months traditional timeline
	- Node team exceeded expectations on data extraction

### Product Management Role Discussion

- Position involves ground-floor involvement across entire product
- Competitive salary at upper range + equity position
- Independent contractor structure with unlimited PTO
- Async work environment, no formal benefits package
- Start date dependent on investor funding completion
	- Originally December/January timeframe
	- Could accelerate if recent investor commitments finalize
- Next steps: schedule POC walkthrough early next week
