### POC Demo & Technical Updates

- Demonstrated updated InnXchange POC with improved interface
	- Added search functionality and column customization
	- Streamlined property addition workflow with 4-page modal
	- Enhanced valuation calculations with real-time updates
	- Fixed equity percentage validation (must total 100%)
- Visual improvements to match Excel-like interface
	- Cleaner penetration/revenue analysis displays
	- Collapsible sections for better navigation
	- Consistent column alignment throughout
- Terminology adjustments needed for hotel industry
	- Change “Revenue” tab to “Penetration Analysis”
	- Separate occupancy, ADR, RevPAR metrics (hotels view these together, not independently)
	- Hotel cap rates typically 7-8% range vs multifamily 4% range

### Partnership Strategy & Market Approach

- Four target partnership options prioritized:
- Marketplace integration planned similar to DealPath’s CBRE/JLL model
	- Brokers can share deals publicly or privately
	- Built-in confidentiality agreements and LOI generation
	- Commission structure: $2,000 flat fee or $2,000 + 5 bps on purchase price
- Seeking experienced startup advisor with hotel tech background
	- Ben Rafter (Hotel Equities) - built 2 successful exits, tech-oriented
	- Sloan - COO/CEO level, capital markets + operations experience

### Vinod & Technical Team Discussion

- Vinod willing to handle GitHub transfer process when agreements signed
	- No current contact with Drew, unlikely to return immediately
	- Would consider returning only with salary (not equity-only arrangement)
- Claude Code development more enterprise-ready than Lovable/Bold alternatives
	- Current POC needs security enhancements for SOC2 compliance
	- Single sign-on and multi-user capabilities required for production
