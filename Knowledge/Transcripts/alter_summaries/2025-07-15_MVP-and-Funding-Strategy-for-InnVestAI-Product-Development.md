### Product Development MVP vs POC Strategy

- POC sufficient for early investor meetings
	- Strong reception from Nir Liebling (Waterton) and Kara Munn (CBRE)
	- Demonstrates clear value proposition for financial analysis AI
	- Mock-up reports acceptable for investment conversations
- MVP requirements for Labor Day deadline
	- Same POC functionality plus document processing
	- Pipeline page (DealPath-style interface)
	- Database and authentication system
	- AI-generated report button (market overview/deal analysis)
	- Cash flow summary with IRR, cash-on-cash metrics

### Funding Strategy & Timeline

- Immediate funding needs: $10k for next 8 weeks
	- Infrastructure setup and cloud hosting
	- Junior developer support ($500-800/month)
	- Mark and Drew to contribute initially
- Target $100k for 6-month runway post-Labor Day
	- Industry sponsor approach (4 companies × $25k each)
	- Driftwood as potential lead sponsor (backed Revere similarly)
	- Additional prospects: Ryman, Fulcrum, Peachtree Group
- Two-year budget framework needed for serious investors
	- Current budget overcalculated by $96k on salaries
	- Focus on essential features, defer marketing/sales costs

### Industry Outreach & Partnerships

- Potential sponsor companies identified
	- Driftwood - strong existing relationship
	- Ryman - Fifth Wall investor, tech-focused
	- Fulcrum - industry solution precedent
	- Davidson - property management angle
- Highgate approach delayed per Mark’s recommendation
	- Product not sufficiently polished for Rick’s standards
	- Too important as industry player to risk early rejection
- Steve Marble meeting rescheduled (family conflict)
	- Seeking buy-in beyond Tom Deshay referral

### Technical Infrastructure Requirements

- Monthly cost structure preferred over upfront payments
- Cloud hosting and database setup priority
- Credit card needed for infrastructure deployment
- AI functionality essential for credibility
	- Document processing and standardized P&L uploads
	- Focus on practical utility over pure AI showcase
