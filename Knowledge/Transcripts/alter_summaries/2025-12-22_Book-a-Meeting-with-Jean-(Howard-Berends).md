### Project Overview & Background

- Financial platform for mid-large property managers (1,000-5,000 units)
- Focus on cash flow and risk management under one roof
- 3 co-founders: Jean (product), 2 engineers with financial platform experience
- Jean’s background: 5+ years fintech/product, previously sold rent payment company, left 3 months ago to focus full-time
- No real competition exists - existing solutions either look backward (PMS/accounting) or aren’t real estate-specific (treasury management systems)
- Strategy to partner with existing PMS providers (Yardi, RealPage) rather than compete

### Pain Points & Solution

- Daily cash visibility across multiple bank accounts and properties
	- Real-time visibility vs static reports from existing PMS
	- Bank reconciliation automation
	- Particularly challenging when operators use different PMS (Yardi + RealPage)
- Forward-looking cash flow forecasting
	- Current manual Excel-based forecasting is inaccurate and time-consuming
	- Risk management incorporating resident payment behavior, delinquencies
- Working capital optimization
	- Once you know future cash position, can optimize cash flow decisions
- My relevant experience noted:
	- My cashflow management app for personal finance with forward-looking budgeting
	- “Managing from the back of the boat” white paper on historical vs forward-looking financial management
	- 90-day rolling forecasting model developed at Bell Partners

### Howard’s Background & Fit

- 30+ years commercial real estate/multifamily experience
- Recent RedIQ role: expanded valuation platform to lifecycle management suite
- Experience with data normalization across multiple PMS systems
- AI coding expertise using Claude - built CRM, project management tools, underwriting POCs
- Available immediately after current consulting project ends (end of month)
- Comfortable with sweat equity model pre-funding
