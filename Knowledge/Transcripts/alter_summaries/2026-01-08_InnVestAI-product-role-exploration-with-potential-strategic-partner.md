### Stealth Startup Property Management Platform Overview

- Core problems being solved for mid-size property managers (1K-50K units):
	- Manual cash flow management using Excel - takes 1-2 resources several weeks monthly
	- Time-consuming, error-prone bank reconciliation process
	- Urgent need for real-time visibility on cash position for owner payments (due 10th-15th monthly)
	- Property managers collect rent, deduct fees, must pay owners quickly without clear cash picture
	- No systematic risk assessment or future forecasting capabilities across 3-6 month horizons
	- Missing revenue optimization opportunities from idle cash sitting in low-yield accounts
	- Largest portion of property management industry affected (mid-size operators)
- Key differentiators vs existing treasury platforms:
	- Real estate-specific vs horizontal solutions that lack property management focus
	- Full scope coverage addressing entire cash management lifecycle (none currently exist)
	- Real-time bank reconciliation and cash flow visibility replacing manual processes
	- Quantifiable cost savings: ~$70K annual accountant salary replacement per property manager
	- Risk management inspired by sophisticated bank financial asset models, adapted for real estate
- Revenue model evolution creating complexity:
	- Beyond rent: amenities, EV charging, internet services, parking fees
	- Cash optimization strategies between collection and owner payment periods
	- Risk-based resident profiling system (green/yellow/red buckets based on payment history)
	- Delinquency management and turnover rate forecasting integration

### Product Development Status & Technical Approach

- Current phase: Defining comprehensive technical stack and infrastructure design
- MVP timeline: ~3 months (conservative estimate from experienced product leader)
- Team composition: 3 full-time engineers + 2 advisory roles (including former real estate company treasurer)
- Technical integration challenges and requirements:
	- APIs with multiple property management systems (Yardi, RealPage, MRI)
	- Standardized financial data format across different PMS platforms to eliminate copy-paste workflows
	- Real-time bank reconciliation capabilities with automated error detection
	- Lease expiration and rent roll data ingestion for accurate cash flow forecasting
	- Traffic and leasing report integration for turnover predictions
	- Seasonality modeling based on historical occupancy and renewal patterns
- Data sources and analytics:
	- Internal PMS financial statements, rent rolls, lease expiration reports
	- Third-party market data for long-term projections (demographics, employer changes)
	- Risk assessment data (earthquake, fire, wind hazards affecting insurance)
	- School ratings, tax rates, and other location-specific factors
- AI/automation focus:
	- Prompt-based development approach rather than traditional specifications
	- Automated QA systems and testing frameworks
	- Machine learning for resident risk profiling and payment prediction

### Partnership Discussion & Potential Role Definition

- Specific role expectations for Howard as product partner:
	- Day-to-day product management as founder’s “wing partner” and sparring partner
	- Hands-on development lifecycle management working directly with engineering team

	- Fundraising activities and investor relationship management
	- Beta customer and pilot program acquisition

	- Asset management module development for ongoing property operations
	- Multi-PMS data standardization expertise (Yardi, RealPage, MRI integration experience)
	- Third-party market data integration (demographics, risk factors, school ratings)
	- Cash flow forecasting methodologies and seasonality modeling for multifamily properties
	- Drag-and-drop financial statement processing and data extraction capabilities
	- API development experience for institutional investors managing multiple properties
- Outstanding discussion items for follow-up meeting:
	- Compensation structure options (equity vs cash vs hybrid arrangement)

	- Partnership terms and strategic consulting role formalization
	- Integration with Howard’s other potential projects (hotel acquisition model on hold)
	- Start date flexibility and onboarding timeline
