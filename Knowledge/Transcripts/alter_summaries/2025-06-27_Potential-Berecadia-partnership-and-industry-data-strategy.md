### Berecadia Update

- Jared Kelso (Berecadia) shared that all hotel groups at Berecadia operate on different servers
- Currently no way to aggregate deals/data onto one central server
- Manual process required for pulling comps
- Berecadia has been supportive of Jared’s team’s needs
- Potential opportunity to help Berecadia consolidate data across servers into cloud solution
- Could structure as ~$200k consulting engagement to aggregate data
- Consulting fee could potentially convert to pre-seed investment

### Lesser & Wise Intelligence

- Lesser & Wise are actively shopping themselves
- Dan and Evan (L&W principals) may separate from LARC division
- Could be approaching Berecadia about acquisition
- L&W principals are highly compensated ($700k+ annual for Evan)
- InnVestAI could be more cost-effective alternative vs L&W acquisition
- L&W primarily focuses on appraisal work and expert witness services
- Dan Lesser previously discussed need for technology in valuations

### HPIS Data Strategy

- Current limitation: HPIS covers small portion of market
- New proposed data flow: Clients → InnVestAI → HPIS (for processing)
- Benefits:
	- Simplified client experience
	- No required HPIS subscription for clients
	- Revenue share opportunity with HPIS
	- Upsell opportunity for HPIS
- Davidson Hotel Group offered to test data transmission process

### Product Development Updates

- Proof of concept progressing well
- Incorporated HPIS market data templates
- Current technical limitations with proof of concept tools
- Need to split valuation model into:
	- Operations/pro forma section
	- Financial/valuation section
- Changed terminology from “valuation” to “pro forma” in sidebar
