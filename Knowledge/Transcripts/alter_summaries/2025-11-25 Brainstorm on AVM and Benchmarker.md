### CoStar/STR Data Disruption Impact

- CoStar changed export data structure without notice
	- New models built for CoStar exports no longer work
	- Jeremy troubleshooting this morning to identify what changed
	- Affects client deliverables and operational stress
	- No flexibility to change back, no communication from CoStar
- Reflects broader industry consolidation with CoStar’s STR acquisition

### Diane’s Personal Motivation and Disruption Philosophy

- Family disruption experience during 1978-79 auto industry crisis
	- Father laid off from Ford for years due to Japanese automaker disruption
	- Family forced to sell house, experienced unemployment hardship
	- Japanese made better, more fuel-efficient products consumers wanted
	- US automakers chose not to disrupt themselves and were disrupted instead
- Inflation at 18% during 1978-1988 period compounded difficulties
- Father eventually returned to Ford, worked into his 70s
- Core belief: “We need to decide what side of disruption we’re going to be on”
	- Don’t want to be sitting in three years saying “we didn’t try”
	- Hotel investment industry currently in disruption phase
	- Partnership approach needed to get ahead of changes

### InnVestAI Valuation Model and Strategic Vision

- AI-powered valuation model as market entry point
	- Uses machine learning for document processing and P&L mapping
	- Handles variations in line item naming (F&B vs food and beverage)
	- Trained on thousands of operating statements for accurate mapping
	- Currently 90%+ success rate on annual extraction, testing monthly
- Marketplace vision for buyers/sellers
	- Brokers input property data, share complete model via email/link
	- Investors access model, adjust for specific IRR requirements
	- AI assistant can suggest changes to hit IRR hurdles via voice commands
	- Process compressed from weeks/months to hours/days
- Deal lifecycle approach vs asset management focus
	- Transaction-focused entry: acquisition → asset management → disposition
	- Differentiation from competitors focusing only on asset management slice
	- Six personas: investor, lender, appraiser, broker, management company, brand
- Future marketplace capabilities
	- PIP data and capex renovation digitization
	- Closing process automation (operating prorations, HUD statements)
	- First accurate cap rate data (NOI + actual purchase price)
	- Integration with Harvey legal platform for P&S and JV agreements
	- Agentic AI relationships across deal ecosystem

### Data Partnership Opportunity with Woodworth Core

- Mark’s perspective: “Whoever wins data wins AI” - repeated industry mantra
- CBRE Trends database situation
	- ~7,000 annual P&Ls plus 3,000 monthly submissions
	- Current leadership doesn’t understand value (“that data’s crap” - Therese Rose)
	- Robert Mandelbaum leaving January 1st, only 2 people remaining to manage
	- New leadership transition creates opportunity
- Historical industry evolution context
	- 1985: Hotel appraisals cost $35K ($115K in today’s dollars)
	- Now: Bank appraisals done efficiently for $4,500-5,000
	- Evolution from manual car counting → AI-powered intelligence
	- Institutional knowledge now convertible to “bits and bytes”
- Woodworth Core’s untapped data assets
	- Thousands of PDFs, offering memorandums, STR reports in database
	- Currently not searchable or extractable - manual process only
	- Huge opportunity for AI-powered data extraction

### Technical Processing and Competitive Landscape

- Current industry processing methods
	- Large clients (Marriott, Omni) use automated APIs
	- Smaller clients require manual processing - major cost center
	- Calibre example: 20+ people doing data processing vs 4-5 building platform
	- CBRE likely faces similar expense structure
- Competitive positioning analysis
	- Michelle Russo’s Single Pane: asset management focus, close relationship with Cindy
	- CHMWarnick: building tech platform, asset management focused
	- Calibri: only serves large companies, can’t efficiently onboard smaller clients
	- Harvey: legal platform being adopted by major real estate law firms
- InnVestAI’s unique positioning
	- Deal enablement vs pure asset management
	- CRE fintech specializing in hospitality niche
	- “Wide open, blue ocean space” - no one has figured out hotel-specific solutions
	- Technology + real estate expertise combination (Howard’s multifamily background)

### Market Entry Strategy and Use Case Discussion

- Jeremy’s recommendations based on Calibri experience
	- Start with economy/midscale properties for data strength and simplicity
	- Avoid complex full-service hotels initially
	- Focus on providing unique data rather than chasing specific use cases
- Jeremy’s cautionary tales from Calibri
	- “Focus too much on use case, not enough on what we were actually doing”
	- Mark Lomano’s STR approach: recreate same format/output for easy client integration
	- Became $1M business in 1.5 years with just Excel output, no coding needed
	- Clients wanted raw data, not customized products for each segment
- Alternative entry strategies discussed
	- Debt/structured finance: high volume underwriting environment
	- Select service focus: simpler underwriting, revenue opportunities in CMBS
	- AI-augmented underwriting tool that collects data while providing immediate value

### Partnership Framework and Validation

- Diane’s partnership vision with Woodworth Core
	- Mark’s industry branding and trust brings validation
	- InnVestAI provides technology, security, legal compliance (SOC 2)
	- Holistic data partnership beyond just P&Ls: capex, closing, legal integrations
- Howard’s multifamily expertise advantage
	- Brings CRE fintech perspective vs pure hospitality focus
	- Understanding of real estate as asset class, not isolated hotel island
	- Technology experience from rediq with data aggregation and anonymization

### Next Steps

- Mark: Contact Robert Mandelbaum immediately
	- Understand current CBRE data processing methods
	- Learn about data partner relationships and submission formats
	- Explore partnership opportunities before January 1st leadership transition
	- Potentially arrange follow-up call for Robert to explain directly to team
- Jeremy: Coordinate call between Howard, John Richter, and himself
	- Review Woodworth Core’s data formats and warehousing systems
	- Assess utility of existing database for partnership potential
	- Include Mark if available for technical discussion
- Team follow-up call scheduled December 5th after 11am ET
	- Review findings from Robert and John conversations
	- Continue partnership framework discussions
	- Explore tactical collaboration opportunities based on initial findings
