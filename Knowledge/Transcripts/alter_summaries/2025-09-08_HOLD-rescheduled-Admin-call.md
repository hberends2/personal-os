### Pitch Deck and Fundraising Strategy

- Budget updates being finalized for Drew and Mark by tomorrow
- Mark taking ownership of pitch book development
- TAM slide included without specific numbers - just market size reasoning
- ARR slide included despite Drew’s pushback
- Pricing structure developed:
	- High-level SaaS pricing for hotel complexity
	- T-shirt sizing (small/medium/large)
	- Future AI-driven module pricing premium
- No dollar amounts included in pricing slides
- AI pricing research shows need for usage-based model
	- Deep research queries cost more resources
	- API intermediary position creates cost variability
	- Popular model: fixed rate up to X queries, overage charges
- Long-term vision (3-7 years): transaction platform charging on AUM
- Fundraising phases planned:
	- $550k for 6 months (through March)
	- $1.5M second round
	- Additional $1M third round
	- Total $4.5M pre-seed before Series A
- Pitch deck completion target: end of week
- Need structured fundraising outreach plan with specific names and dates

### Product Development and Demo Strategy

- Pulse demo scheduled (Thursday or Tuesday) - interactive deck concept with photos/visuals
- Data platform discussion - HB to reach out to Delve for SOC2 compliance
	- Delve can accelerate SOC2 process from months to weeks
	- Cost unknown, timing likely late 2026/early 2027
- Demo readiness concerns for Mark’s comfort level
- Options for October 6th Phoenix lodging conference:
	- Use current PoC with updated design matching MVP
	- Screenshot-based presentation of future functionality
	- Real-time data upload demo using existing infrastructure
- Vinod making good progress on data extraction
- One-pager/infographic needed for conference networking

### Market Feedback and Operational Updates

	- Hotel management companies showed strong interest and vision alignment

	- Meeting with Megan Kochi (hotel attorney) Thursday
	- Exploring API integrations and AI agent workflows
	- Legal workflow expansion beyond AVM capabilities
- Team member taking retail job for financial necessity

	- $30/hour rate (unexpectedly low)
	- 5-10 hours/week cap ($150-300 weekly)
	- Logo finalization and infographic creation priorities
- Drew’s Actus partnership concerns:
	- Promissory note restrictions (not safe note)
	- Database control questions for future digital feeds
