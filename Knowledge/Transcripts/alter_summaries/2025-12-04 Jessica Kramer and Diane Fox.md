## Enhanced Notes

### Team Transition & Leadership

- Drew departure: minimal data/analytics impact since he functioned more as consultant than active founder
	- Mark and Drew described as “more consultants than they were active founders”
	- Drew’s main contributions: asset management perspective for valuation model, QA testing
	- Howard’s reaction as product manager: “that rubbed me the wrong way”
- Howard transitioning from pure product role to co-leadership with Diane
	- Background in real estate analytics, business intelligence - also serving as “the data guy”
	- Overseeing product development while helping with operations
	- “We’re not going to be staying in our lanes by any means”
	- Supporting operations as Diane focuses on fundraising and other initiatives
- Friends and family contact now specializes in ESOP setup/maintenance
	- Will help with cap table management going forward
	- Additional capability Diane may have missed mentioning earlier

### Product Strategy Pivot

- Original proof of concept too general - mixed broker/investor/lender features without serving any persona perfectly
	- “Kind of a mix of what a broker or an investor or a lender may want to see, but didn’t really fit any one of those personas perfectly”
- Decided to focus on lender market first based on positive conversations with Diane’s contacts in lender/lender servicing groups
	- Lenders use simpler underwriting approach
		- Example: view “food and beverage in total” vs. breaking into subcategories
		- Don’t get into the minutia that brokers and investors require
	- Process advantages: “a little bit easier and quicker” with faster turnaround times
	- Strategic rationale: easier entry point before expanding to more complex broker/investor markets

### Technical Modifications for Lenders

- Metric card overhaul from investor-focused to lender-focused KPIs
	- Removing: IRR, ROI, cash-on-cash returns (metrics lenders don’t pay attention to)
	- Adding: debt service coverage ratio, yield, and other lender-specific metrics
	- Implementation: “just simply have to swap out the formulas and change those cards”
- Consolidating deal setup into comprehensive one-stop modal
	- Current process: input property name/address, then add assumptions in different model locations
	- New approach: consolidated input for loan balance, required debt service, lender parameters/caveats/hurdles
	- Users can modify inputs as needed, but goal is streamlined initial setup
- Financial data extraction modifications for lender preferences
	- Current capability: extract annual data (2024 annual, 2025 year to date)
	- Lender requirement: monthly or quarterly basis vs. annual for investors/brokers
	- Technical solution: add logic to parse monthly formats (“2025 January, 2025 February”)
	- Assessment: “not that we have to reinvent anything, it’s just that we have to fine tune it”

### Advisory Partnership & Development Timeline

- Jessica’s advisory services: $1500/month + equity percentage, 2 calls/month
	- Focus on introductions and guidance
	- Approach: “how can I be helpful?”
	- Scope includes both product advisory and startup fundamentals
	- Howard’s question: advisory covers “dotting I’s and crossing T’s” for startup operations
	- Jessica’s expertise spans building startups, growth, investment, hospitality connections
- Current development status and timeline
	- Near completion: input modal and related functionality
	- Strong progress: successful financial statement data extraction
	- Beta testing target: early Q1 2025 (January to early February timeframe)
	- Holiday work dependency: timeline depends on progress over holiday period
- Future AI automation roadmap
	- Next phase: automated document processing
	- Capability: extract debt service requirements from uploaded loan documents
	- Current limitation: manual input required for loan parameters
	- Expansion plan: same automation approach for brokers and investors after lender market success

### Next Steps

- Schedule follow-up meeting for next week
	- Jessica in Paris first half of week
	- Preferred timing: Friday (vs Thursday due to potential jet lag)
	- Alternative: Tuesday or Thursday afternoon after 2pm the week of December 15th
	- Purpose: continue discussion after team has time to process current conversation
