## Summary

The meeting focused on the design of the hotel market data model and strategies for data sourcing. It was decided to change the term 'growth rate' to 'YoY' and to include both a Market and Comp set in the model. There was a discussion on whether the data should be user input or automated, and the sources for market data and comp set data were identified.
