### Howard’s Background & Experience

- 30+ years commercial real estate, exclusively multifamily
- Started in operations, moved to asset management
- Strong analytics background, worked with RealPage 15 years ago on first consolidated data warehouse
- Last 15 years in prop tech space focused on multifamily BI and analytics
- Joined Rediq in 2021 (leading automated valuation model for multifamily acquisitions)
	- Rediq got leapfrogged by AI-focused competitors
	- Company sold to another firm caught up in RealPage class action lawsuit
	- Engineering resources moved to core product, Rediq stagnated
- Currently Chief Product Manager at InnVestAI
	- Writes technical specifications for software engineers
	- Creates prototypes in no-code environments

### Mike’s Background & Current Focus

- Construction PM background, nearly a decade in hospitality
- Father runs owner’s rep PM shop, major client Oxford (large class A assets in Chicago/Midwest)
- Handled draw and financial work, Excel-based workflows
- Joined Rabbit (budget workflow tool, asset agnostic) on sales team
- Worked with Taylor Bird (multifamily-focused capex and acquisitions facilitator)
	- Tool models entire buildings with just rent roll and address
	- Had trouble generating clear value narrative
- Started fractional CFO shop ~8 months ago
	- Focus on outsourced accounting for real estate businesses
	- Has 2 serious bookkeeping clients plus tech consulting work

### Mike’s Advisory Vision

- Believes traditional SaaS model struggling due to AI disruption
- Proposes bespoke consulting model for real estate tech stacks
	- Focus on outcomes rather than software features
	- Act as concierge/liaison for business owners
- Hospitality as target market
	- Smaller sector where everyone knows each other
	- Easier infiltration than larger multifamily market
	- 10-20 investment companies could form stable client base
- Examples of potential hospitality targets from Juniper Square podcast
	- Mitch from Noble, Greg Freeman from Peachtree, Eric from KSL, Trinity guys, Carlos from Driftwood

### InnVestAI Current Status & Challenges

- Recently lost 2 of 5 co-founders due to disagreements
	- 20/20/20/20/20 split didn’t work well
	- One founder opposed raising capital, wanted perfect MVP, caused gatekeeping
	- Founder departures actually positive for moving forward
- Has first anchor safe note investor: $75k from Driftwood
	- Diane also consulting on their technology initiatives
	- They use NorthSpire for construction workflows
- Need to raise additional $425k in Q1-Q2 (3-5 more safe notes)
	- Target: customer-investors like other hospitality investment firms
	- Total $500k would fund Howard, CTO, plus Mike’s involvement

### Product Development Status

- Core underwriting platform mostly built
	- Recreated hotel underwriting Excel model in SaaS format
	- 90%+ accuracy on data extraction from hotel P&Ls (annual level, not monthly yet)
	- All hotel-specific calculations (occupancy, ADR, RevPAR penetration analysis) working
	- Built to feel exactly like Excel to reduce adoption friction
- Current limitations
	- Generic model, not customized for specific user types (investor vs lender vs appraiser)
	- Missing lender-specific UI and metrics
	- Lender module components built but need assembly for testing
- Potential partnership with Mark Woodworth to revive Benchmarker for data enhancement

### Market Opportunity & Strategy

- Hotel investment space has zero valuation tools (unlike multifamily with multiple options)
- Targeting deal-focused leaders rather than asset managers
	- Deal guys are A players who run companies, asset managers are B players
	- Focus on speed and winning deals rather than perfect asset management tools
- Go-to-market approach
	- Customer-investor model (like Elise AI in multifamily)
	- Early customers become investors and provide real feedback
	- Iterate product based on actual usage rather than theoretical requirements

### Potential Collaboration Areas

- Fractional CFO services for InnVestAI
	- Need to “button up” financial processes as lean startup
	- Not full-time role but regular engagement needed
- Capex/renovation module development
	- Mike’s Rabbit/Taylor Bird experience valuable for workflow design
	- Hotel renovations completely manual, major pain point
	- Touches multiple personas: owners, lenders, appraisers, management companies
- Partnership opportunity with Mind Click
	- Led by Andrea Foster (strong hospitality networker) and Joanna Abrams
	- Already tracking sustainable renovation products
	- Existing relationships with brand A&C departments that issue PIPs
	- Could accelerate renovation product development by 2 years
- Advisory practice development
	- Use InnVestAI data warehouse as foundation
	- Target hospitality investors struggling with tech stack decisions
	- Mike’s dad’s PM expertise adds practitioner credibility
