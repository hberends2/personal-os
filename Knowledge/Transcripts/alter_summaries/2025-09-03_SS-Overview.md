### Social Security Overview

- Webinar by Hillary Hatch from Social Security Administration Grand Rapids
- Part 3 of quarterly series by Alex Goodwin, Blue Way Financial Partners/Raymond James
- Recording will be distributed to attendees
- Focus on timing decisions for Social Security filing - no single “best age” for everyone
- Policy subject to change - current information at SSA.gov

### Benefit Qualification & Credits System

- Need 40 credits (10 years work) to qualify for retirement benefits
- Must be 62+ years old to collect
- 2024 credit thresholds:
	- $1,810 gross earnings = 1 credit
	- Maximum 4 credits/year = $7,240 total earnings needed
	- Timing irrelevant - can earn all credits in one month or spread across year
- Credits never lost once earned
	- Example: Career gaps for childcare/eldercare don’t erase previous credits
	- Re-entering workforce later preserves all prior credits

### Benefit Calculation Methodology

- Three-step computation process using lifetime earnings:
	- Wages adjusted for inflation through indexing
	- Monthly average of 35 highest earning years calculated
	- Results in Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)
- Indexing example (birth year dependent):
	- 1991 earnings: $10,000 actual × 2.55 index factor = $25,504 indexed
	- Index factor decreases over time, becomes 1.0 at age 60+
- 35-year requirement crucial:
	- Missing years filled with zeros
	- Additional work year only increases benefit if it’s among top 35 years
	- Example: 25 work years = 25 years + 10 zeros in calculation

### Retirement Age Impact on Benefits

- Full Retirement Age (FRA): 67 for those born 1960 or later
- Benefit percentages by filing age:
	- Age 62: 70% of full benefit
	- Age 67 (FRA): 100% of full benefit
	- Age 70: 124% of full benefit (maximum possible)
- Example with $1,000 FRA benefit:
	- Age 62 filing: $700/month
	- Age 67 filing: $1,000/month
	- Age 70 filing: $1,240/month
- Monthly increases for each month delayed between ages 62-70
- No benefit increase after age 70 - no point in further delay
- Permanent decision: once filed, locked into that percentage forever
- Annual cost-of-living adjustments still apply regardless of filing age

### Spousal & Divorced Spouse Benefits

- Spousal benefits structure:
	- Maximum 50% of worker’s unreduced FRA benefit
	- Reduced if spouse claims before their own FRA
	- Combined with own benefit if spouse’s own benefit < 50% of worker’s
	- No reduction to worker’s benefit amount
	- Cannot collect until worker files and starts collecting
- Example scenario:
	- Husband’s FRA benefit: $2,000
	- Wife’s maximum spousal: $1,000 (at her FRA)
	- If wife’s own benefit is $700, gets $700 + $300 spousal = $1,000 total
	- If wife’s own benefit is $1,200, no spousal benefit (own benefit higher)
- Special exception: unreduced spousal benefits when caring for child under 16 or disabled child
- Divorced spouse benefits:
	- Same 50% maximum of ex-spouse’s FRA benefit
	- Requirements: 10+ year marriage, currently unmarried, both 62+, ex-spouse eligible for benefits
	- Key advantage: can collect even if ex-spouse hasn’t filed yet
	- No impact on ex-spouse’s benefit or current spouse’s benefits
	- Must call local office for divorced spousal information (not available online)
- Benefit calculation always based on worker’s FRA amount:
	- If worker files early at $700, divorced spouse still gets 50% of $1,000 FRA amount
	- If worker delays to $1,240, divorced spouse still gets 50% of $1,000 FRA amount

### Survivor Benefits Structure

- Children eligible if unmarried and:
	- Under 18, or
	- Up to 19 if in high school full-time, or
	- 18+ and disabled before age 22
- Widow/widower benefits:
	- 100% of deceased worker’s unreduced benefit at survivor’s FRA
	- As early as age 60 at 71.5% of deceased worker’s full benefit
	- As early as age 50 if disabled
	- Any age if caring for child under 16 or disabled child
- Remarriage after age 60 doesn’t affect survivor benefits
- Strategic filing example:
	- Husband receiving $2,000/month, wife receiving $1,500/month
	- If husband dies first: wife drops $1,500, receives $2,000 (higher amount)
	- If wife dies first: husband continues $2,000 (already higher)
- Dual entitlement strategy:
	- Can start survivor benefits at 60, switch to own retirement at 62-70
	- Or start own retirement at 62, switch to survivor benefits later
	- Choose timing based on which maximizes lifetime benefits

### Working While Collecting Benefits

- Earnings limits apply to all benefit types before FRA
- 2024 thresholds:
	- Under FRA all year: $23,400 annual limit
	- Year reaching FRA: $62,160 limit
	- After FRA: no limit
- Penalty structure:
	- $1 withheld for every $2 over limit (under FRA)
	- $1 withheld for every $3 over limit (FRA year)
- Special first-year rule:
	- Monthly limit: $1,950 (under FRA)
	- Only applies to months actually collecting benefits
	- Example: file in October, only October-December earnings count toward monthly limits
- Important exclusions:
	- Only wages/self-employment income count
	- Pensions, 401k, IRA distributions don’t count
- Withheld benefits recovery:
	- No direct repayment of withheld amounts
	- Benefit recalculation at FRA provides credit for withheld months
	- Results in higher monthly payments going forward

### Benefit Taxation

- Combined income formula: AGI + non-taxable interest + 50% of Social Security benefits
- Tax liability thresholds:
	- Joint filers: 50% of benefits taxable at $32,000-$44,000 combined income
	- Joint filers: 85% of benefits taxable above $44,000 combined income
	- Single filers: 50% of benefits taxable at $25,000-$34,000 combined income
	- Single filers: 85% of benefits taxable above $34,000 combined income
- Voluntary withholding available:
	- Four percentage options (approximately 7%, 10%, 12%, 15%)
	- Must elect this option, not automatic

### Medicare Enrollment Details

- Eligibility begins at 65 regardless of Social Security claiming
- Automatic enrollment:
	- Only if already receiving Social Security benefits before 65
	- Covers Part A (free) and Part B ($185/month standard premium)
- Manual enrollment required if not collecting Social Security:
	- Initial enrollment period: 3 months before through 3 months after 65th birthday
	- Can delay without penalty if covered by current employer group plan
- Premium structure for higher earners (based on tax return from 2 years prior):
	- Standard: $185/month for individuals under $106k, couples under $212k MAGI
	- Higher tiers: additional $74/month per person for next income bracket
- Penalty for late enrollment:
	- 10% penalty per 12-month period delayed
	- Penalty permanent for entire duration of Medicare coverage
	- Exception: special enrollment period for those with qualifying employer coverage
- HSA consideration: cannot contribute to HSA once Medicare Part A begins
