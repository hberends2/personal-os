### Howard’s Current Consulting Work

- Focusing on consulting with couple of startups
- Hotel valuation startup
	- Rediq-style valuation model for hospitality industry
	- No existing solutions for hotels (unlike other asset classes)
	- Simpler than expected - standardized financial statements
	- Targeting lenders first (basic cash flow analysis)
	- Plans to expand to brokers, investors, appraisers, asset managers
	- Founded by consultant (30 years hospitality, 5 years trying to build this)
	- Recent founder conflict resolved, back on track
- Fintech startup for multifamily cash management
	- Very early stage
	- Experienced founders (25 years, multiple startups)
- Third startup discussion ongoing
	- Direct Rediq competitor
	- Ahead technologically but behind on product offerings

### Development Approach & Tools

- Using Claude Code in terminal for development
	- Switched from other tools (Bolt, Replit, Lovable) due to doom loops
	- Claude connects directly to computer, retrieves files
	- 80% complete on live proof of concept
- Full Stack engineer from Rediq converting POCs to production-level MVPs
- Development timeline: days/weeks vs months
- Funding remains primary constraint

### Job Search Challenges

- Age discrimination in interviews
	- Great phone interviews, rejection after video calls
	- Hiring managers half his age
- Shifted focus to fractional/consulting work
- Updated LinkedIn profile accordingly
- Seven-stage interview processes not worth time investment

### David’s Job Search Context

- Looking for Series A+ companies
- $150K+ salary requirement
- Interested in RealPage opportunities
	- Company hiring again after DOJ issues and Tomo Bravo downsizing
	- Dirk now CEO (formerly #2 under Steve Winn)
	- Howard has contacts but most C-suite departed

### RealPage Cultural Insights

- Historically very siloed organization
- Growth through acquisition, no product origination
- Internal teams treat each other as external clients
- Even internal API access requires payment
- Each department P&L responsible, creates business relationships internally
- Culture change could be “game changer” for company
