### Product Creation & Satisfaction

- Question: Describe a product that gave you satisfaction - what did it do and why was it fulfilling?
- Response: RedIQ Lifecycle Management System (zero-to-one platform)
	- Problem: Original RedIQ only handled acquisition underwriting, then users were done until next deal
	- Innovation: Extended platform through entire ownership lifecycle (3-10 years)
	- Suite included: Asset management budgeting, pro formas, demographic data, location analytics
	- Value delivered: Single platform for ongoing data analysis vs acquisition-only tool
	- Customer benefit: Portfolio-wide analysis regardless of management company (Yardi, OneSite, etc.)
	- Pro forma vs actual tool: Up to 3 scenario modeling for buy/sell analysis
	- Popular with owners managing properties across multiple management companies

### Product Manager Success Qualities

- Question: Top three qualities for successful product managers with examples
- Response:
	- Curiosity
		- Currently building AI proof of concepts, learning coding/databases
		- ADHD drives need for constant change vs “watching paint dry” in traditional real estate
		- Team of 3 can now do what used to take team of 15
	- Patience
		- Can’t jump on features just because they sound good or largest client wants them
		- Must align with business needs while avoiding shiny object syndrome
		- Balance patience with not dragging feet
	- Being a learner
		- Early mistake: “All I gotta do is get these people to do it the way I do it”
		- Discovery: Smaller companies often outperform large REITs
		- Example: East Coast company’s hurricane preparedness with strategically located appliance inventory

### Product vs Business Strategy

- Question: How does product strategy differ from business strategy?
- Response: “I don’t think it does”
	- Product strategy is way to carry out business strategy
	- Product team doesn’t have all answers - job is knowing where to get answers
	- Business interest drives the product
	- Product opportunities must align with business interests

### Innovation from Inception to Launch

- Question: Describe innovative product from 0 to 1
- Response: RedIQ Lifecycle Management Suite
	- Challenge: Nobody else in organization had experience with it
	- Innovation: No competition existed - different from owner-focused asset management tools
	- Targeted operators and smaller teams at individual asset level vs accounting-style tools
- Alternative example: Conservus ESG/Sustainability dashboards (2001)
	- Post-Paris Accord sustainability comparison tool
	- Compare user carbon footprint reductions to Paris Initiative goals (2025, 2030, 2035)
	- Left before full launch when poached by RedIQ

### Challenging Status Quo

- Question: Situation where you challenged beliefs and standard thinking
- Response: Berkadia SDLC transformation
	- Problem: Linear waterfall process (PM → architect → design → development)
	- Innovation: “Four Horsemen” approach - product, engineering, architecture, design together from step one
	- Result: Shortened development cycles by months
	- Applied to entire organization, not just RedIQ
	- No fighting - “honest, open, candid conversation” approach

### Data Analytics Techniques

- Question: Go-to analytics techniques for large datasets
- Response:
	- Tools: Power BI, Excel mastery, partners with data architects/engineers
	- Key skill: Separating vanity metrics from revenue-driving metrics
	- Vanity metrics: Volume-based (document count, customer count) - “looking in rear view mirror”
	- Business metrics: Predictive measures explaining customer acquisition/retention patterns
	- Focus: “Finding needle in haystack” - data that tells actionable story

### Real Estate Inefficiencies & Solutions

- Question: Observed inefficiencies in real estate and improvement ideas
- Response:
	- Main inefficiency: Slow technology adoption
	- Pandemic forced some adoption (revenue management, self-service leasing, smart apartments)
	- Office buildings adopt faster than other asset classes
	- Solution strategy: Bottom-up selling to site staff vs top-down to C-suite
		- C-suite too removed from daily operations
		- Site staff understand pain points better
		- “Sell your way up the chain rather than starting at the top”

### Difficult Customer Management

- Question: Managing very difficult customer situation
- Response: Graystar sustainability dashboard project
	- Challenge: Hand-drawn dashboard request with non-existent data requirements
	- Approach: Education rather than rejection
	- Strategy: Explain why certain metrics impossible, offer suitable alternatives
	- Often provided better solutions than originally requested
	- Philosophy: “Don’t just say we can’t do it - say we can’t do it this way, but we can do that”
	- Contrast with RealPage: Refused to promise undeliverable features like salespeople did

### Howard’s Questions to Interviewer

- Market conditions since March: Political climate challenging ESG/sustainability funding
- International offset opportunities: Europe also seeing some pushback, though less than US
- AI integration: Measurable using AI for data extraction (building internal capabilities)
- Current consulting work: Similar to RedIQ but different asset class, focusing on financial statement data extraction
