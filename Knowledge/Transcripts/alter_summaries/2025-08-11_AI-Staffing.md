### Budget and Pitch Deck Planning

- AI resource allocation needs defined for budget and pitch deck preparation
	- Two-page limit for investor presentation to technically adept groups
	- Investors evaluate tech investments regularly, need clear explanation of AI strategy
	- Original question: AI engineer coding vs junior product manager focused on AI
	- Previous Friday call shifted direction after discussing third engineer priority
	- Vinod made offer to third engineer, but AI position still needs definition
- Financial placeholder required showing thoughtful consideration of AI impact
	- Need to demonstrate understanding of costs for investor credibility
	- Choice between hiring another body vs other resource types (API integrations)
	- Domestic vs offshore resource cost implications significant

### AI Staffing Strategy and Resource Decisions

- Product Manager vs AI Engineer comparison detailed:
	- PM: domestic hire, very high demand position currently, significantly more expensive
	- AI Engineer: offshore preferred, $35-40k annual budget allocation
	- Howard comfortable managing AI product development internally
- Howard’s capacity assessment:
	- AI tools dramatically reduced administrative workload (week to 10 minutes)
	- Years ago would have needed specialized PM, but AI automation changed requirements
	- Confident staying ahead of engineering team with current bandwidth
	- No anticipated need to expand product management staff in first 1-2 years
- Data scientist role evaluation:
	- Cherry shared AI data scientist job posting for reference
	- Julius AI tool highlighted for financial projections and predictive analytics
	- Data science field being disrupted by AI algorithms and analysis automation
	- Five years ago was hottest tech job, now “on chopping block”
	- Full-time data scientist difficult to justify currently
	- Consultant relationships available if needed for specific projects
- Offshore engineering preference confirmed for AI role
	- No requirement for same time zone collaboration
	- Howard comfortable with offshore AI engineer arrangement
	- Cost-effective solution for specialized technical needs

### Technical Infrastructure and Integration Challenges

- API integration cost analysis:
	- Multiple platform connections required: Procore, Harvey, others
	- Real Page and Yardi “extremely expensive” - strategy to limit data sharing
	- API costs generally decreasing but varies significantly by provider
	- Drew to research specific costs on tomorrow’s all-teams call
- Property management industry connection opportunities:
	- Goal to be first property type connecting data end-to-end across commercial assets
	- Niche industry advantage - no dominant giant controlling everything
	- Potential for mutual benefit partnerships and cross-selling opportunities
	- Client must authorize data provider to share via API (account details required)
- Infrastructure and monitoring considerations:
	- Production support engineer needed (~$35-40k offshore)
	- Infrastructure monitoring costs separate from personnel (included in infrastructure budget)
	- 25% contingency for unknowns and wild card expenses
	- Automated QA and feature flags discussion deferred for separate conversation

### Quality Control and Process Improvements

- Website functionality incident with Mark’s Phoenix panel:
	- Mark moderating high-profile panel, included InnVestAI in bio
	- Website not working when tested, credibility concern with industry contacts
	- Mark has friendly rivalry with panel contacts, embarrassment factor high
	- Immediate fix promised by Vinod for today
- Enhanced process control requirements:
	- Mark’s experience from previous proptech startup emphasized early quality checks
	- Risk of multiplying mistakes without proper monitoring
	- Monitoring dashboards and alerts needed for production environment
	- Mobile notifications for system issues to enable immediate response
- Development vs production environment protocols:
	- Current dev environment frequently broken during active development
	- Staging environment notifications before updates required
	- Clear communication needed before demos (“don’t touch this environment/feature”)
	- Feature flags and automated testing to be implemented later
- Client support infrastructure planning:
	- Chatbot customer service as first line of defense (industry standard)
	- Howard to compile thorough user guides and step-by-step documentation
	- Initial escalations handled directly by Howard and Vinod for learning
	- Client service representative needed “down the line” based on client volume growth
	- Production support person needed for technical issue resolution
