- Data Ingestion Requirements:
	- Need ability to process Excel and PDF financial statements
	- AI will assist with document processing and data standardization
	- 70-30 split between Excel vs PDF format from clients
	- Will use Hotel BIS API for structured data where available
- Development Resources:
	- Howard working full-time
	- Vinod part-time with potential offshore junior developer ($500/month)
	- Need to determine Vinod’s available bandwidth for MVP development

### MVP Definition & Scope
