### Top of mind

- Year zero proof of concept completed and ready for documentation
	- Creating separate PRD rather than modifying existing ones since it touches revenue, expense, and AVM formulas
	- Siobhan requested documentation over the weekend - needs to be completed urgently
- Demo preparation critical for upcoming investor meetings
	- Need to finalize staging environment for MVP demo
	- Goal: 10-15 minute demo covering deal creation, document upload, data population, pro forma tweaks, and AI summary
	- Expecting pushback from Mark about completeness but aligned with Drew and Diane on minimum viable demo approach

### Updates and wins

- Financial statement processing accuracy very strong
	- Processing most formats Drew provided successfully
	- Using GPT-4.5 with good live testing results
- Team progress on staging environment
	- UI very close to POC design
	- Good momentum on MVP features
- Driftwood check expected this week
	- Additional $50k potential from Mike (Diane’s husband’s friend) still interested
	- Diane focusing on female-led founder organizations for fundraising

### Challenges and blockers

- LLC formation still not closed after months of delays
	- No banking account to deposit incoming checks
	- Drew has stretched personal account situation too long
	- Mark hasn’t engaged much on LLC discussions, possibly working through Drew
- Payment process issues affecting team morale in India
	- Salaries consistently 5+ days late creating negative impression
	- Need proper payroll structure and benefits to attract quality candidates
	- Considering registering Indian entity for seamless full-time arrangements vs. contractor model
- Limited financial statement format diversity in testing
	- Current tests from limited number of companies with similar formats
	- Risk of client uploading document that fails processing from smaller companies with different formats

### Mutual feedback

- No direct feedback exchanged during this meeting
- Discussion about improving team structure and payment processes to support growth

### Next Milestone

- Howard to complete year zero PRD documentation within next few days
- Howard to review staging environment and provide UI feedback
- Vinod to focus team on Drew’s feedback for MVP completion
- Vinod to explore Excel export functionality for automated testing comparison
- Vinod to investigate costs and process for Indian entity registration
- Team to migrate CRM from personal domain to InnVestAI domain (lower priority)
- Explore partnerships with hotel industry organizations (American Asian Hotels) for marketing and sales funnel opportunities
