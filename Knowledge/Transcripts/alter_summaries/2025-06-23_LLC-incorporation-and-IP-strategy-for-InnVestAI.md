### Business Structure & Legal Updates

- Decided to form multi-member LLC rather than C-Corp
- Will incorporate in Delaware following industry standard practice
- Converting from LLC to C-Corp later is possible if investors require it
- Sam to work on LLC formation this week
- Initial copyright costs: $250 ($350 with assistance)
- Will pause on trademark until logo is finalized

### Patent & IP Strategy

- Need to evaluate patenting opportunities around data validation and information storage processes
- CoStar Group has 107 patents globally (39 granted)
- VTS has patents for marketplace and data modeling tools
- Sam’s attorney to join next meeting to discuss IP protection options
- Will focus on copyright protection initially for product names/features

### Partnership Development

- Close to finalizing official partnership with ProfitSord/Actable
- Partnership would provide:
	- API access
	- Trusted affiliate status
	- Access to broader data sets
- M3 recently partnered with Blackstone Ventures - potential future opportunity
- McKibbin family (M3 owners) identified as potential strategic partner

### Data Validation Strategy

- Two-level validation approach:
	- Data from Hotel BIS with existing validation
	- Match between Hotel BIS data and database
- Focus on key metrics:
	- Revenue matching
	- GOP (Gross Operating Profit) matching
	- NOI (Net Operating Income) where available
- Validation challenges with smaller operators (e.g., Canna Hotels) not reporting fixed expenses

### CBRE Opportunity

- Met with Therese Rose, COO of CBRE Hotels
- Received names of 5 CBRE analysts for proof of concept feedback
- CBRE facing data integrity issues with benchmarking product
- Strategic opportunity: Help solve CBRE’s data validation challenges
- CBRE’s venture arm differs from traditional VCs - focuses on strategic relationships

### Market Position & Validation

- Need GOP to NOI conversion capability for automated valuation model
- Will focus on GOP benchmarking initially due to data reliability
- Real estate taxes/insurance data varies significantly by operator
- Target 4% standard rate for FF&E

### Fundraising Strategy

- Industry standard: $2M raise for 10-15% equity
- Implies $10M pre-money valuation
- VCs seeking “unicorn” potential (targeting 10,000% IRR)
- Strategic investors (like CBRE) may value partnership over pure financial returns
- Need clean data validation story for investor pitches
