### Team Dynamics & Communication Issues

- Post-Monday meeting frustration with Mark's disconnect from team direction
- Core disagreement: Mark focused on Excel/existing processes vs broader AI positioning
- Diane experiencing difficulty managing Mark's "know-it-all" tendencies and gender dynamics from brokerage culture
- Mark enlisted Drew in criticizing approach but hasn't contributed to fundraising efforts
- Need for clearer role definitions and boundaries between CEO/CCO responsibilities

### Safe Note vs Equity Investment Confusion

- Clarified safe notes function as convertible loans, not immediate equity
- Key mechanics:
	- No valuation required at issuance
	- Converts to equity only when Series A fundraising occurs (typically at $2.5-3.5M ARR)
	- Includes interest protection if company fails
	- Provides discount when converting to equity
- Mike Sherman situation: wants $50k for 10% equity (incompatible with safe note structure)
- Proposed solution: separate equity grant (1-2%) for legal services + safe note investment

### Pitch Deck Strategy & Development

- Two distinct decks needed for different audiences:
	- Investor deck (Diane's version) - AI opportunity focus
	- Customer deck (Mark/Drew's version) - Excel/workflow focus
- Current investor deck needs PowerPoint cleanup and design improvements
- Timeline corrections needed: quarters instead of months, proper 2025-2027 progression
- Key investor messaging: focus on measurable AI value, not "shiny objects"

### Fundraising Timeline & Pressure

- Urgent need for $550k in next couple months
- Mark waiting for "perfect product" before approaching contacts like Dan Lesser
- Diane carrying full fundraising load with women's network and limited male contacts
- Deck must be finalized by Tuesday for upcoming investor presentations
- Cannot continue restarting deck development process

### Product Vision & Modules

- Comprehensive platform roadmap spanning 5+ years:
	- AVM (first module)
	- Transaction marketplace with AUM-based pricing
	- Debt/structured finance tools
	- Management company workflows
	- Legal, PIP, loan servicing modules
	- Investment management and ESG collaboration
- Pricing evolution: SaaS → T-shirt sizing → AI-enhanced → transaction marketplace
- Network effect opportunity through brand connections and international scaling

### Technical AI Positioning

- Four core AI components visualization needs simplification:
	- AI Agents (automated workflows)
	- Agentic AI (deep research)
	- LLM integration
	- RAG implementation
- TAM approach: 6-7% of US commercial real estate volume
- Emphasis on solving complex hotel data fragmentation vs general Excel problems
