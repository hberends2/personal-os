### Cash Flow Problem Context

- Jean’s 5+ year journey understanding property management payment digitization
	- Initially providing payment services, curious about measuring digitization value
	- 30% of tenants still pay rent by check (down from 70% five years ago)
	- Digital payments (ACH, credit/debit) improve cash flow timing vs. checks
- Problem discovery across property managers
	- Heard same feedback from top 5 PMs (MRI, etc.)
	- No existing treasury management platform addresses property management specific needs
	- Large companies (top 10-20 US property managers) use custom solutions mixing different platforms

### Market Validation Through Steve (Ex-CFO Belt Partners)

- Confirmed widespread dissatisfaction with existing solutions (Yari, Real Page)
- Steve consulting with other CFOs on cash management challenges
	- Not speaking individually but representing peer group feedback
	- Problem spans from small ($1k) to large ($1M+) property managers
- Validated that pain point exists across company sizes

### AI Integration Strategy

- Two-pronged AI approach identified:
- Development timeline impact: reduced from 15-person, 6-month team to 2-person, 2-month MVP
- AI value proposition for cash flow management:
	- Integration still required with financials and property operating systems
	- AI excels at forward extrapolation, seasonality analysis, market insights
	- “How can I get X dollars by specific date?” scenario planning
	- Edge case identification and suggestions Howard hadn’t considered
