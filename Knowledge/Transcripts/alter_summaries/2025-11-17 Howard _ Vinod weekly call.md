### Top of mind

- LLC signing on hold until Diane situation resolved
	- Partners refusing to move forward without absolute clarity on Diane’s role
	- Concern about being legally bound while partnership dynamics remain uncertain
	- Mark and Andrew pushing hard for immediate signing, creating tension
- Team dynamics fracturing between different factions
	- Diane not agreeing with Mark and Andrew’s direction
	- Mark and Andrew rejecting Diane’s input
	- Vinod questioning motivations behind urgency to sign LLC

### Updates and wins

- Shiva created functional chatbot for document queries
	- Working with both single and multiple documents
	- Providing good responses, needs UI improvements
	- Could potentially be integrated into product roadmap
- Indian company registration progressing
	- Initial name registration completed
	- Still need tax ID and bank account setup
	- Will enable direct international transfers from company account
- Development team completing map implementation and Drew’s feedback items

### Challenges and blockers

- Payment processing issues with current setup
	- Drew’s personal Remitly transfers experiencing delays/problems
	- Monthly payments uncertain going forward
	- Need corporate banking infrastructure in place
- Visa dependency limiting job flexibility for Vinod
	- Current role neither high-paying nor motivating
	- Repetitive data pipeline work after initial learning curve
	- Team aware of his partnership status
- Mark’s communication style creating friction
	- Claims exclusive business experience, unwilling to explain decisions
	- Takes questions as personal challenges to his authority
	- “Just do whatever I’m saying” approach without knowledge sharing

### Mutual feedback

- Vinod expressing demotivation that development team can sense
	- Concerned about losing talented developers who are outperforming senior hires
	- Team has been waiting 3-4 months for clarity on company direction
- Need to secure development team before they seek other opportunities
	- Already communicated payroll requirements via email
	- Junior developers producing better work than experienced seniors

### Next milestone

- Wait for Diane’s availability (1-2 weeks) before any LLC signing
	- Diane must be final signatory to ensure her protection
	- No agreements until all partnership voting rights clarified
- Secure next month’s payroll funding
	- Amount already communicated via email
	- Critical to retain development team
- Demo chatbot functionality to Howard
- Continue SSO login development (challenging for RA)
- Address environment-related technical issues
