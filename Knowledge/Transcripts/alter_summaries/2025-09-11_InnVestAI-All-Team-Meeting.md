### Interactive Deck Technology Overview

- Problem: Commercial real estate stuck using PDFs since 1993 for investor presentations
	- 75-page PDFs with complex spreadsheets create investor fatigue
	- Most investors read only 7.5 minutes of text daily vs 2.5 hours on social media
- Solution: Apply social media principles to deal presentations
	- Attention: Movement, animation, vibrant visuals
	- Access: Collapsible information - summary view with “read more” options
	- Action: Interactive elements force engagement, move info to long-term memory
- Demo highlights:
	- Live typing animations, embedded videos
	- Expandable sections for detailed financial data
	- Interactive maps with Street View integration
	- Real-time number updates from backend changes
	- Mobile-responsive with QR code sharing

### Business Model & Pricing

- Current pricing: ~$5k per deck (vs traditional broker OM at $10-15k)
- Two service options:
	- Client provides ready content → Avi’s team “interactifies” it
