### Product Roadmap Overview

- 3-year roadmap extending through 2028 with color-coded phases
	- MVP (light purple): Current development focus through end 2025
	- Version 1 (light green): Debt model release Q1 2026, equity model Q2-Q3 2026
	- Asset management: Q4 2026 or sooner depending on earlier project success
- Conservative timeline allows flexibility to shift left if progress accelerates

	- Lower complexity: Deal summary, loan packages, OM extraction
	- Higher complexity: Predictive analytics, real-time market intelligence
- Added discovery boxes for legal workflow and renovation workflow per Drew’s request

### Investor Preparation Strategy

- Focus on next 12 months rather than full 3-year vision for investor meetings
- Mark attending Phoenix conference October 6th - needs concise presentation materials
	- iPad/tablet demo capability preferred over live demos
	- Print materials as backup for networking
- LARC data visualization priority for Dan Lesser meeting
	- Power BI dashboard showing dynamic market data
	- Proof of concept integration rather than full development derail

### Development Environment Status

- Staging environment destroyed due to lack of usage and infrastructure costs
- Dev environment functional with key pages built
	- Investment summary and valuation pages mapped and ready for data population
	- UI improvements needed: sidebar navigation instead of top buttons
- Team review scheduled for Tuesday with Mark, Diane, and Howard
	- Focus on layout and organization feedback
	- Avoid major disruptions to existing POC work

### Fundraising Strategy and Valuation

- Safe note template targeting $5M pre-money valuation cap
- Mike Sherman pushback on valuation ($500K suggested, rejected as unreasonable)
	- 10% ownership for $50K investment deemed excessive
	- Potential alternative: Higher valuation + equity participation for legal services
- Consistency across all safe notes critical for future Series A
	- Avoid special deals that complicate investor presentations
	- Most favored nation clauses could force matching best terms
- Target: $250-350K initial raise to reach March 2026, then additional rounds at higher valuations

### Budget and Resource Planning

- Monthly expenses reaching $66K by March 2026
- Contractor 1099 payments legally prohibited for self-payment
- Payroll service (Gusto) needed for proper salary structure
- Additional development resources needed
	- 2 more Indian developers could accelerate timeline
	- Offshore product manager ($140K/year) to reduce Vinod’s workload
	- Product owner role combining PM duties with developer scheduling

### Revenue Timeline and Market Strategy

- First monetization milestone: Lender clients by end Q1 2026
- Large addressable market in lending sector requiring this functionality
- Every debt deal requires appraisal - dual revenue stream opportunity
- Strategic partnership potential with Carlos’s Domino project
	- Internal tech deployment against investment analysis
	- Mutual benefit: Their Domino work helps investment management, our AVM helps them
