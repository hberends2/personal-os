### Meeting Background & Context

- Prep conversation for upcoming call with John Ricker from Woodworth Core
- Diane providing strategic background on competitive landscape
- Diane will stay in background during actual call, available as “lifeline” if needed

### Competitive Threat Analysis

- Drew reached out to Mark Woodworth after cease and desist
	- Likely pitched HotelBiz as better solution for CBRE data processing
	- Drew has strategic partnership with Profit Sword (now Actable)
	- Real risk Mark might prefer working with Drew over InnVestAI
- Profit Sword/Actable capabilities:
	- Processes data for 8,000 hotels (15 years in business, owned by Alpine Investors)
	- Strong technical infrastructure but zero real estate understanding
	- Focus only on hotel operations, not trading/investment side
	- Significant technical debt with management company clients
	- Limited attention available for owner-side business

### John Ricker & Woodworth Core Profile

- John merged with Mark Woodworth ~18 months ago
- Background as scrappy appraiser doing select service work with regional banks
	- Strong Southeast presence
	- Partner was Daniel Riley pre-merger
	- Built robust database through manual “call around” data collection
	- Pride themselves on proprietary deal/trade information
- Team composition mix of old PKF veterans and new talent
	- Mark sold PKF to CBRE in 2014, regrets the decision
	- Jack Cordial is economist who built AVM product (prefers not working with women)
	- Jeremy from Caliber represents “new blood”

### Technology Capabilities Assessment

- Howard’s confidence in competitive position vs Actable:
	- Actable only offers basic data aggregation and Power BI reporting
	- No AI capabilities identified on their platform
	- InnVestAI already ahead with integrated AI functionality
	- Can demonstrate superior chat-based database querying similar to Driftwood’s system
- Driftwood’s Mission Control platform shows advanced AI integration
	- Chat interface for financial queries (built by data scientist Kenny)
	- Real-time NOI performance analysis with budget comparisons
	- Potential model for industry-wide deployment

### Strategic Opportunities

- Positioning advantage: InnVestAI understands real estate unlike Profit Sword
- Potential partnership with Otellier (rebranded from My Digital Office)
	- Processes 10,000+ hotels with strong API integrations
	- Executive Chairman Ali Malu interested in capital markets module
	- MCR as potential second anchor client (similar to Driftwood)
- Driftwood valuation model testing opportunity in January
	- Build track record and statistics for future pitches
