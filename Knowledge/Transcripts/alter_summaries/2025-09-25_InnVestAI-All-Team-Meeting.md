### Operations & Investor Relations Update

- SAFE note sent to Carlos on Tuesday night, followed up to check for questions
	- Note was about a week delayed, allowing adequate review time
- Budget review for 2026 balance still pending from Mark
- Pitch deck reviewed with Mark yesterday, minor updates planned today/tomorrow
- One-pager development in progress with Carrie, questions addressed today
- Logo feedback deadline: 10pm Pacific tomorrow (all team input required)

### Strategic Partnership Opportunities

- Bridge Group introduction potential through Chelsea (VP at VC firm)
	- Bridge coordinates with Berends on select service debt placement
	- Strong relationships with Marriott/Hilton franchise development teams
	- Waiting for marketing materials before introduction
	- Strategic partnership focus rather than funding opportunity
- Mohari Hospitality connection discovered
	- Drew’s existing customer (luxury global portfolio)
	- Properties include: Four Seasons Toronto/Madrid/Costa Rica, Ritz Costa Rica
	- Asset management emergency situation - coffee meeting scheduled 9:30am tomorrow
	- Gencom also partnered with Mohari (noted as “controlling” partner)
	- Potential services-for-equity opportunity identified

### Logo Design Iteration Discussion

- Current building logo concerns:
	- Generic commercial property appearance (not hotel-specific)
	- Building dominates text, poor balance
	- Font spacing too wide, needs compression like Elise AI
- Alternative concepts explored:
	- Hotel key imagery (leveraging “key to AI” concept)
	- Traditional hotel bell
	- Bed/pillow design (AI on pillow, InnVest on bed)
- Color scheme decisions:
	- Blue/green base colors from research (financial trust/security)
	- AI text changed from green to gold/orange to match pitch deck
	- Need unified style guide development
- Interim approach: Focus on font improvements, compress letter spacing, lighter feel

### Phoenix Conference Strategy & SOC 2 Compliance

- Conference expectations clarified:
	- 3rd largest hotel conference in US (~3,000 attendees)
	- Target: 5 key conversations for potential $100k SAFE investments
	- Follow-up approach: Screenshots via email, then demos/pitch meetings
	- Network effect focus within small hospitality industry (few hundred key decision makers)
- SOC 2 compliance discussion:
	- Not 6-month roadmap priority
	- May not apply since no PII handling planned
	- Vanta tool referenced from previous experience
	- Further research needed on requirements for financial institution partnerships
