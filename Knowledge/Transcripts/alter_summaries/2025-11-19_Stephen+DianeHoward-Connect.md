### Their background

- Stephen is from Robert Douglas, described as “probably one of the best hotel debt brokers in the country”
- Specializes in higher end luxury, bigger placements with partner Rob Styles
- Previously worked at Sonnenblick Goldman together, created hotel evaluation model that became industry standard
- Team composition: 7 senior professionals, 13 total employees, 4 junior line-level professionals handling data input
- Current pipeline: 30 transactions (“frankly a pretty good number”), each junior member staffed on 5-8 deals (up to 10)
- Deal timelines vary: shortest 6 months, often 9-12 months for mandates
- Current tech stack includes:
	- Ascendix CRM (third-party Salesforce interface for CRE)
	- CoStar (Star Report data, 3-year forecasts down from 5 years)
	- Real Capital Analytics (private market loan data, owned by MSCI)
	- Capitalize (AI-powered LLC piercing, VC-backed, 24-hour turnaround)
	- Henry AI (5th customer, Series A, regular development calls for OM production)

### Pain points and needs

- Manual data entry is extremely time-consuming
	- “It’s just such a painful process to input all that data. It’s exhausting”
	- Analysts working late nights (“up at midnight or 1:00”) re-keying monthly data for trailing twelve updates
	- Initial underwriting takes analysts “a day or a day and a half” currently
- Data validation and quality control challenges
	- Wide client sophistication disparity: “sometimes it’s an export out of QuickBooks, sometimes just getting a PDF of a summary file”
	- Need validation against “gross incompetence” and fraud - ensuring line items sum to totals
	- Must reshape client data to conform with constantly changing USALI standards
	- Marriott forms “wildly different from everyone else’s”
- Excel workflow vulnerabilities
	- “Excel is a minefield of danger” - formulas get overridden or changed for specific situations
	- Previously had two separate East Coast vs West Coast valuation models, now unified with toggle
- Technology fragmentation
	- Current tools don’t integrate: “they’re also not talking to each other”
	- Manual CRM input required despite having multiple data sources
- Missing industry-specific solutions
	- No comprehensive benchmarking since CBRE shut down Benchmarkr
	- HotStats “never complete” for expense benchmarking

### Questions or concerns

- Intellectual property protection of proprietary underwriting model
	- “I’m a little wary about handing over our model” due to Sonnenblick Goldman DNA
	- Model includes sophisticated fixed/variable expense components, POR/PAR drivers
	- East Coast vs West Coast valuation toggle (input value vs input returns)
	- Tranche-level debt pricing (0-40%, 40-50%, 50-60%, 60-65% LTV tranches)
- Data validation methodology
	- “Does it validate that the math… that the line item shown are meeting the total?”
	- Preference for extracting line items vs totals to maintain formula integrity
	- Need confidence that validation occurs (currently through manual process)
- Advanced underwriting capabilities
	- Segmentation analysis and monthly seasonality modeling
	- RevPAR forecasting with supply addition dynamics
	- Fixed vs variable expense component toggles for nuanced profit modeling
- Integration complexity with existing workflows
	- Henry AI handles OM production but receives outputs from their model, not raw data
	- Need to maintain value-add on cash flow/pro forma creation

### Budget and timeline

- No specific budget discussed
- Timeline expectations:
	- Monthly model updates standard practice
	- Mandates typically 6-12 months duration
	- Seeking to reduce underwriting time from “day or day and a half” to “half hour”
	- InnVestAI indicated 3-6 month timeline to usable product with customer feedback
- Current InnVestAI status: MVP phase with 90-95% accuracy on annual data extraction
