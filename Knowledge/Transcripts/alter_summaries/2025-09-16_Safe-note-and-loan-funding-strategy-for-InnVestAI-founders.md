### Safe Note Investment Structure

- Safe note vs convertible note distinction clarified
	- Safe note: agreement for future shares when valuation determined
	- For Mike Sherman and Cartwheel investor conversations
	- Pre-money vs post-money calculation methods available
- Valuation cap mechanics
	- Cap = maximum value for equity conversion, not current company valuation
	- Example: $10M company valuation with $5M cap = investor gets 2x shares
	- Provides investor protection if company value exceeds cap

### Founder Compensation Framework

- Distribution model issues identified
	- Current operating agreement requires equal distributions to all founders
	- $12,500 individual withdrawal allowance problematic for investors
	- Administrative complexity with escrow/interest tracking across 5 founders
- Loan structure recommendation (attorney-advised)
	- Individual loan agreements outside operating agreement
	- 1% interest rate, flexible repayment terms
	- Repayment options: owner distributions, future payroll, or equity conversion
	- Avoids state payroll tax complications until CFO hired
- Equity conversion mechanics
	- Requires company valuation (suggested $5M baseline)
	- $50,000 loan = ~1% equity at $5M valuation
	- Converted shares come from options pool, not founder dilution

### Budget and Development Timeline

- Funding requirements clarification
	- $250,000 needed through Q1 2026 (corrected from Diane’s typo)
	- Additional $250,000 for Q2-Q4 2026 ($500,000 total through Dec 2026)
- Product roadmap structure
	- MVP/V1 development tracks parallel, not sequential
	- Budget expenses overlay monthly but not directly tied to development milestones
	- Need more granular feature definitions for investor discussions
- Framework implementation
	- Shared document system needed (OneNote/Teams vs individual Excel files)
	- Business plan foundation: mission, problems, solutions, target audience, roles
	- Should have been established in March - addressing 6-7 month delay
