### Logo Design & Brand Direction

- Logo iteration needed - currently reviewing 7 options
	- Personal preference for #3 (building incorporated)
	- Need more colorful options vs. current monotone designs
	- Consider breaking up “InnVestAI” with 2-3 different colors
	- Add building element similar to existing samples
- Domain considerations
	- Own both InnVestAI.com and .ai domains
	- Prefer .ai but emails set up on .com (expensive to migrate)
	- Will switch after first investor funding

### Conference Preparation & One-Pager

- Mark heading to Phoenix lodging conference next week
	- Need one-pager ready before departure
	- Unclear if targeting investors vs. potential clients
	- Drew doing 70-80% of pitch deck work currently
- Carrie requirements for one-pager creation:
	- Industry conference examples for design reference
	- Key buzzwords and product features to highlight
	- Clarification on target audience (investors vs. clients)
- Pitch deck confusion
	- Diane and Mark/Drew created separate decks
	- Need two distinct versions: investor deck vs. sales deck
