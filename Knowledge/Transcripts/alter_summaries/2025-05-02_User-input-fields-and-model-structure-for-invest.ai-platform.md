### UI Design Review & Navigation Structure

- Demonstrated mock-up of property input page with specific hotel category selection
- Designed left navigation pane to allow direct access to different sections
- Showed example workflow for entering hotel details (name, address, etc.)
- Integration capabilities with Drew’s database and Google API for auto-population
- Ability to skip through sections as needed vs. linear progression

### Data Input Categories & Organization

- Revised expense categorization:
	- Changed “Operating Expenses” to “Departmental Expenses” and “Undistributed Expenses”
	- Established “Non-Operating Expenses” category (formerly Fixed Expenses)
	- Created separate categories for Management/Franchise Fees
	- Added FF&E Reserve and Owner-Funded CapEx distinctions
- Revenue categorization:
	- Maintained Operating Revenue classification
	- Included Food & Beverage, Other Operated, and Miscellaneous Revenue subcategories

### Data Integration Opportunities

- Discussed potential $50,000 one-time purchase of STR database
- Identified Cvent as valuable data source for:
	- Meeting space information
	- Property photos
	- Hotel amenities
	- Competitive set details
- Explored possibility of direct data feeds from operators (similar to Drew’s current setup)

### Market Intelligence Strategy

- Outlined approach for competitive set analysis
- Discussed STR report integration without violating CoStar terms
- Proposed building proprietary database through direct operator submissions
- Identified opportunity to become alternative to CoStar for specific report types
