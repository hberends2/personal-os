### Project Status & MVP Discussion

- Discussed distinction between POC and MVP approaches
	- POC: Internal use and demos only
	- MVP: External users, requires funding
	- Mark and Diane have differing views on funding timeline
	- Mark wants MVP before seeking funding
	- Diane and Howard align on needing funding first
- Infrastructure costs lower than expected
	- Initial estimate: $700-1000/month
	- Annual infrastructure cost estimate: ~$10,000
	- Additional costs only if implementing ML training
- Need clear feature prioritization
	- Focus on core valuation model functionality first
	- Simple AI integration possible via ChatGPT/Claude API for investment summaries
	- Must define specific ML/AI features that will drive sales

### Technical Implementation Plan

- GitHub codebase strategy:
	- Will use existing code as UX/logical guide
	- Can reuse some React components if clearly written
	- Calculations can be referenced but not directly copied
	- Database schema can be leveraged
- Development priorities:
	- Core infrastructure setup (AWS/Azure)
	- Database implementation
	- CI/CD pipeline
	- Security scanning
	- Can disable certain features (monitoring, logging) in development
- Document extraction approach:
	- Summary page extraction straightforward
	- Detailed breakdowns (food/beverage, misc.) planned for future
	- Will need AI mapping for varying financial statement terms

### Funding & Resource Needs

- Immediate funding needs:
	- Infrastructure costs (~$700/month initially)
	- Team discussing $150/person monthly contribution
	- Need company credit card/bank account setup
- Additional resource requirements:
	- One additional engineer needed to accelerate development
	- Looking for experienced developer who is cost-effective
	- 3-month timeline for initial development
- Potential funding sources:
	- Consulting arrangement with first client
	- Client payments could apply to future subscription
	- Using paying clients to attract additional funding

### Administrative Updates

- LLC filing in progress
	- Awaiting personal information from team members
	- Need CPA for:
		- Bank account setup
		- Profit distribution structure
		- Tax planning
- Ownership structure:
	- Each member has 20% stake
	- Need to determine distribution method (stock options vs annual distribution)
- Team agreed: cannot work without compensation long-term
	- 3-month initial development period
	- Need funding/revenue stream after that period
