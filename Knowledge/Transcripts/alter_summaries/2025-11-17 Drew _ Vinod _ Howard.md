### Company Financial Crisis

- Diane’s personal financial situation affecting judgment
	- November mortgage delinquent
	- Desperately needs money
	- Clouding business decisions
- Driftwood $75k safe note agreement problematic
	- Diane signed unilaterally without circulating to partners
	- Agreement structured wrong - consulting vs safe note confusion
	- She plans to take $8.5k monthly for 6 months = $51k personal
	- Leaves only $24k for actual operations
	- Written approval from Driftwood exists but legally irrelevant

### Partnership Breakdown

- Relationship dynamics and concerns
	- Diane vs. Mark: Communication style clash; Mark is often blunt, but is viewed as directionally correct on most operational/governance points
	- Diane vs. Drew: Drew’s frustration growing due to repeated unilateral actions and delays; empathy for Diane’s situation but sees her actions as impediments to the business
	- Ownership mindset: Diane positions InnVestAI as “her company,” creating misalignment with current equal-partner structure (5 equal founders)
	- Explicit disagreement history: Team discussed compensation-from-safe approach multiple times; majority clearly opposed, but Diane moved ahead anyway
- Consequences of unilateral actions
	- Driftwood SAFE signed and structured without partner review; consulting vs SAFE consideration conflated
	- Use-of-funds expectation mismatch: Diane intends $8.5k/month for six months ($51k personal), leaving ~$24k for operations
	- Governance risk: Sets precedent of acting without approvals; undermines trust and decision-making norms
	- Operational friction: Diane skipping/joining late to group calls; prefers 1:1 conversations that create misalignment or false sense of consensus
- Accounting, legal, and third‑party impacts
	- Distributions issue: Personal draws would require equivalent partner distributions on the books; not feasible for an early-stage company
	- Tax/compliance risk: Potential penalties and adverse accounting treatment if treated as distributions instead of payroll or loans
	- Remitly flagged payments: Hold placed due to lack of operating agreement; short-term workaround succeeded, but India payments at risk next month without OA

### Governance Solutions Needed

- Titles and roles
	- Remove CEO titles entirely; maintain “Co‑founders” with defined areas of focus (product, engineering, finance, partnerships, ops)
	- Clarify that titles confer no unilateral authority; execution follows governance rules below
- Decision rights and approvals
	- Supermajority (4/5) for: fundraising, debt, equity grants, major vendor commitments, bank changes, budget approval
	- Majority (3/5) for: routine vendor spend within approved budget, minor contract changes, marketing spend over threshold
	- Two‑signature rule: Any SAFE/convertible/debt instrument or binding term sheet requires at least two founder signatories (Diane may be one, but needs one additional founder)
	- Dual‑attendance norm: For external partner/investor meetings, strive for two founders present or same‑day written recap to all founders
- Operating agreement (OA) updates (immediate)
	- Incorporate the nine already-agreed points (vesting, fundraising cadence, governance, budget/use of funds, exhibits for employment/comp)
	- Add explicit authority matrix and two‑signature requirements into OA
	- Counsel to implement edits (~2 hours) and circulate final; target 24‑48h signature window
	- Blockers: Diane’s insistence on line‑by‑line review is delaying payments and operations; group intends to proceed on deadline
- Compensation/finance mechanics
	- Use loan mechanism temporarily: up to $8.5k/month to Diane recorded as company loan (not distribution)
	- Stand up payroll (W‑2) for future founder compensation; loans netted against future distributions/bonuses so no out‑of‑pocket check expected
	- Track SAFE proceeds in a designated ledger account; maintain sources/uses and monthly reporting

### Next Steps

- Governance and documentation
	- Finalize OA with nine points, authority matrix, two‑signature rule, vesting, employment exhibits; attorney to draft within ~2 hours
	- Circulate OA for signatures with 24–48h deadline; failure to sign triggers alternate path below
	- Set up company bank account and designate ledger sub‑account for Driftwood SAFE proceeds
- Communication to Diane
	- Drew to send email (cc: all founders) stating consensus on the nine points, the OA timeline, and the two‑signature policy going forward
	- Provide 24 hours for questions; absent substantive changes, proceed to signatures
	- Shift away from 1:1s on governance/finance matters; use group calls or written threads to avoid misalignment
- Financial operations
	- Upon OA execution: deposit full $75k into InnVestAI account; immediately record up to $8.5k/month to Diane as company loan until payroll starts
	- Stand up payroll/W‑2 process; define founder comp policy tied to budget and runway
	- Maintain sources/uses and monthly reporting; ensure compliance for international payments (India team)
- If Diane refuses or misses deadline
	- Proceed with four operating members; convert Diane to non‑voting member with economic interest only (no operational authority)
	- Remove her signature requirement from OA; update cap table/economic terms accordingly
	- Continue operations, budgeting, and vendor payments under new governance
- Personal comms protocol
	- Howard to decline unilateral governance/finance discussions; redirect to group forum to prevent false consensus
