### Top of mind

- InnVestAI LLC structure remains incomplete after months of delays
	- Diane has been over-complicating the legal document instead of letting attorney handle changes
	- Cannot open business bank account without executed LLC agreement
	- Five partners need alignment on voting mechanisms before moving forward
- Driftwood payment arrangement poorly communicated and executed
	- $75,000 total payment split into monthly installments ($12,500 November/December)
	- Diane unilaterally decided on fund distribution without partner consultation
	- Creates precedent concerns about decision-making authority

### Updates and wins

- LLC roadblocks finally addressed in morning conversation with Diane
	- She acknowledged over-engineering approach was wrong
	- Agreed to simplify document with attorney assistance rather than DIY legal work
	- Found online startup bank (Brex) that accepts applications with EIN before LLC execution
- Business banking solution identified and applied
	- Brex application submitted, account expected within 1-3 business days
	- Will provide credit cards and expense management for all partners
	- Eliminates need for personal account transfers going forward
- Strong networking progress through Diane’s connections
	- Former Radisson CEO meeting scheduled for 4:00 PM today
	- Multiple potential investors and partners in pipeline through her contacts
- Development team making solid progress
	- UI/UX nearly complete on both pages
	- Addressing Drew’s feedback points from recent review

### Challenges and blockers

- Offshore development team payment and structure issues
	- No formal payroll, benefits, or timely payments currently
	- Risk of losing talented developers due to lack of proper employment structure
	- Need to establish Indian private company for formal operations in 2026
- Mark and Drew salary expectations misaligned with contribution levels
	- Both expecting $8,500/month despite not working full-time hours
	- Mark’s actual contribution limited to pitch deck and Excel spreadsheets
	- Need pro-rata compensation based on actual hours worked
- Decision-making authority unclear among five equal partners
	- Recent Driftwood situation exposed lack of consultation protocols
	- Need defined supermajority vs majority voting requirements
	- Partners making unilateral decisions without group input

### Mutual feedback

- Vinod expressed concerns about Diane’s organizational capabilities as CEO
	- Questions whether she can handle major decisions if struggling with smaller issues
	- Emphasized need for collaborative decision-making rather than unilateral choices
- Agreement that Mark’s sales role needs clarification
	- His network valuable but SaaS technical sales requires different skillset than real estate
	- Should focus on introductions and relationship facilitation rather than closing deals
	- Consider commission-based compensation instead of salary for his capital markets role
- Shared concern about losing development team momentum
	- Current informal arrangement unsustainable long-term
	- Need formal company structure and benefits in India by 2026

### Next Milestone

- Today’s LLC discussion priorities:
	- Define supermajority voting requirements (everything else becomes majority)
	- Address partner succession planning (what happens if someone “gets hit by a bus”)
	- Finalize salary structure based on actual time commitment
	- Clarify roles and responsibilities for each partner
- Immediate financial actions:
	- Reimburse Howard’s $900 out-of-pocket expenses from first Driftwood payment
	- Set up automatic payments to development team once Brex account active
	- Establish formal expense tracking and reimbursement processes
- Create online tracking system in CRM
	- Move Drew’s spreadsheet to Google Sheets with full audit logging
	- Include fundraising, revenue, and expense sections with monthly tracking
	- Provide visibility into all partner activities and financial movements
- Establish three equity pools in LLC structure:
	- Employee pool (0.2-0.5% typical)
	- Key employee pool (2-5% for CFO, sales roles)
	- Investor pool (with Drew/Mark participating as investors, not getting extra ownership)
