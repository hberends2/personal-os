- Diane expects to receive LLC document review feedback by this weekend, with simultaneous team review as backup if she cannot complete it
- Carlos meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 5:00 PM (he is traveling this week)
- Safe note documentation has been received and filed with November 1st date

### Review of Progress

- Year Zero development work is in progress and expected completion by end of this week
- Map functionality should be completed by tomorrow or day after
- Staging environment testing is ongoing with active formulas now implemented
- EBITDA and NOI calculation testing still needed for input sections
- Demo preparation timeline established for week of November 17th for outreach to schedule early December meetings

### Key Achievements

- Active formulas are now working in the system for calculation cards
- Basic loan monitoring framework has been developed with debt service coverage ratio and debt yield calculations
- Investment assumptions modal interface completed, providing more intuitive user flow than previous navigation system
- Loan portfolio summary view capability identified as key differentiator from competitors

### Challenges and Adjustments Needed

- Competitive pressure from Michelle Russo’s single pane platform, which has secured major clients including Trinity and KS with approximately 20 customers
- Single pane pricing model ($400-500 per hotel per month) creates cost barrier for Access Point Financial’s 200-300 hotel portfolio (approximately $1.5M annually)
- Need to distinguish InnVestAI from monitoring-only competitors by offering both underwriting and monitoring capabilities
- Technical challenge of integrating appraisal data and processes into the platform while maintaining appraiser independence requirements
- Time management constraint requiring focus on monitoring functionality first, then underwriting module within 60 days
