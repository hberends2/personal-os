### Strategic Partnerships & Opportunities

- Mike Skiba discussion (tomorrow 10:30am)
	- Potential fractional CFO role for QuickBooks setup and fund management
	- Primary value: CapEx expertise linking renovation costs to underwriting
	- Has built similar technology solutions previously
	- Consulting approach: advising customers on complete tech stacks (us + Yardi + MRI + Juniper)
	- Strategy prevents software commoditization through integrated consulting
- Mike Tanner call (Thursday)
	- Howard’s uncle, fractional marketing executive for SaaS companies
	- Extensive prop tech experience (Fifth Wall’s Lesser - repair/maintenance platform)
	- Will help develop go-to-market strategy
	- Advantage: outside perspective, can help articulate product clearly
- Mark Woodworth meeting (Friday)
	- Discovery/pitch hybrid call
	- Drew raised concerns about engineering team cease and desist
	- Howard confident legal threats don’t apply - only consulting work done, no proprietary contributions
	- Plan to maintain call despite legal intimidation

### Legal Settlement Strategy

- Current situation analysis
	- Drew contributed ~$9,000 in actual expenses (hosting, legal, offshore development)
	- Mark contributed $0 despite budget showing $7,500 commitment
	- Cease and desist claims intellectual property theft - Howard dismisses as baseless
	- Settlement discussions requested in attorney letter
- Sherben’s involvement (complex offer)
	- Willing to invest $50-60k but wants equal equity with Howard and Vinod
	- Wants to pay Drew back immediately as part of settlement
	- Suggesting $25k settlements each for Drew and Mark (Howard strongly opposes)
	- Also proposing company dissolution and Safe Note cancellation
	- Howard prefers minimal settlement: Drew gets expenses back with generous interest, Mark gets consulting fees only
- Recommended approach
	- Draft response letter but have Mike review before sending
	- No rush to respond immediately
	- Consider Delaware attorney for proper legal jurisdiction
	- Howard’s experience: 30+ years finance, built dashboards since 2012, Director of Business Intelligence at Bell Partners and AUM/RealPage

### Company Structure & Funding

- Ownership restructuring needed
	- Howard wants 51% to prevent partner coup scenarios
	- Previous 20/20/20/20/20 split acknowledged as problematic
	- Jessica consultation Thursday to determine investor-attractive structure
- Sherben equity considerations
	- Split legal services equity (vesting over 5 years) from investment equity
	- Both would be non-voting shares
	- Concerns about overreach given his demands
- Additional funding prospects
	- Howard’s brother-in-law expressed investment interest (potentially six figures)
	- Won’t pursue until current legal situation resolved
	- European company acquisition experience, understands strategic value

### Driftwood Relationship & Revenue

- Current consulting arrangement
	- $12,500/month in arrears, paid 15th of each month
	- $7,500 already in bank account, second payment clearing this week
	- Direct deposit to company account going forward
	- 6-month agreement with extension potential
- Strategic value beyond revenue
	- Access to multiple personas: lender, management company, investor
	- Howard building relationships across organization (Ian - Debt/Structured Finance, Prana)
	- Potential internal customer for AI-augmented valuation model
	- Supports their retail investment product requiring frequent valuations
	- CapEx use case as they’re also developers
- Protection priority
	- Avoid disrupting customer/investor/advisor relationship
	- Maintain quiet, professional approach
	- Don’t want dissolution to damage Driftwood connection
