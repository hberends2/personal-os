### Budget Framework & Funding Strategy

- Monthly costs estimated at $560 in subscriptions plus engineering/founder costs
- 6-month budget targets $500-550k total
- Framework designed for prioritized funding discussions:
	- Get Vinod off full-time job (highest ROI)
	- Founder survival pay for Drew/Diane
	- Marketing assistance (Carrie)
	- AI engineering costs (Feb/March timeframe)
- Pre-seed funding goal: $4-4.5M over 3 years before Series A

### Expense Management

- Howard needs $100/month subscription (not urgent, can delay)
- $25/month GenSpark subscription not immediately needed
- Drew will handle payment method transitions when ready

### Pitch Deck Development

- Mission: “Creating hotel industry standard for AI-driven analytics by hotel people for hotel people”
- Key messaging shift: Focus on AI implementation challenges vs Excel replacement
- Structure includes problem, solution, features, team, roadmap
- USALI (Uniform System of Accounts for Lodging Industry) integration highlighted
- Data partner slide needs “Prospective” label (not actual partnerships)
	- RealPage, NetSuite corrections needed
	- Procore discussions active for PIP cost tracking

### Competitive Intelligence & Pricing Research

- SymmetRE (multifamily to hotel pivot): $1-2 per key per month
	- Target: 1500+ key portfolios ($18k annually)
	- Uses ETL connections vs APIs due to vendor resistance
	- Customer: Midas Hospitality (Midwest owner-operator)
- Pricing strategy considerations:
	- Per-deal vs per-key models: Per-deal pricing preferred to avoid fixed costs during market downturns
	- Market volatility impact: redIQ lost clients when multifamily market dropped 60% but maintained same fixed pricing
	- Four-phase pricing evolution:
		- High-end SaaS pricing initially due to hotel complexity
		- T-shirt sizing (small/medium/large) similar to Juniper Square
		- $/deal pricing strategy
		- AI feature markup as capabilities expand
		- Future AUM-based pricing (5+ years) when becoming full transaction platform
	- Beta client strategy: 6-month window with beta pricing discovery across user types (appraiser, lender, owner, broker)
	- Revenue model considerations:
		- Base "lights on" revenue from loan servicers at affordable rates
		- Variable pricing for AI features with cost tracking (1.3 cents to generate, charge $1)
		- Transaction volume-based pricing to align with market cycles
	- Competitive benchmarking: Present competitor pricing as framework without committing to specific numbers

### Product Demo Progress

- Document upload and data extraction functioning
- AI-generated summaries operational (1.3 cents cost, could charge $1)
- 60% data readiness score with mapping gaps identified
- Valuation model framework complete
- Infrastructure supports usage-based billing tracking
- Production environment will be significantly faster
- LARC data integration planned (structured file, no AI needed)
