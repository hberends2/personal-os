### Mark’s Position on LLC

- Refuses to sign LLC in current state
- Demands all issues resolved before any funds deposited
- Proposed 3-hour call to hash out remaining issues
- Wants job descriptions finalized first, then agreement on all terms

### Partnership Breakdown

- Diane no longer wants to deal with Mark
- Mark blamed everything on Diane during Howard’s call with him
- Mark made false claims about past discussions
	- Denied consulting arrangement for $75k that was discussed weekly
	- Rejected responsibility for delays
- Relationship deteriorating beyond repair

### Potential Solutions Discussed

- Rip up current LLC, restart with 4 partners
- Offer Mark 5% equity like key employee instead of founder stake
- Uncertainty whether Drew would stay without Mark
	- Drew may be caught in middle vs. loyal to Mark
	- 80% chance Drew leaves if Mark exits

### Alternative Talent Pipeline

- Diane consulted friends/mentors - all excited about product
- Two strong candidates identified from disbanded CBI team
	- One built entire real estate analytics system in 90s
	- Led team that created product sold by CBI this year
	- Both asking to partner immediately
- Risk: Mark could bad-mouth company, but talent available to replace

### Immediate Financial Pressure

- Diane facing mortgage delinquency, needs money now
- Estimated need: $2-3k for mortgage, possibly up to $8.5k total
- Howard and partner willing to personally help with $2-3k
- IP ownership: Howard and partner own all development work
	- No formal InnVestAI entity exists yet
	- Could restart with different team if needed

### Next Steps

- Wait and observe situation before major decisions
- Howard to message Drew privately about Diane’s financial needs
- Possible quick call with Drew to discuss options
- Avoid including Mark or Diane in financial discussion thread
