### Project Development Status

- Howard has completed revenue modeling down to total revenue, including:
	- Rooms revenue
	- Food and beverage revenue
	- Navigation pane implementation for easy access
	- Only two user inputs needed: occupancy and ADR
- Next development priorities:
	- Complete expenses section
	- Add financing components
	- Fix current technical issues
	- Create rough proof of concept within 1-2 weeks

### Legal & Visa Considerations

- Current visa situation:
	- Vinod has visa from different company, legally restricted to work there
	- Janet (Vinod’s wife) has H4-EAD visa allowing unrestricted work
- Proposed structure:
	- Janet to be listed as partner/on paper
	- Need to avoid documenting specific work arrangements in email
	- May need H1B visa sponsorship eventually when company is in position to do so

### Funding Strategy Options

- Angel Investment route:
	- Target: $300K-400K initial raise
	- Could approach 2-3 investors for smaller chunks
	- Family offices identified as viable funding source
	- Don’t need perfect pitch deck according to some sources
- Strategic Partnership possibilities:
	- CBRE incubator program opportunity exists
	- Berkadia BeEngage program potential
	- Could partner with multiple brokers simultaneously
	- Would require giving up some ownership but maintain control
- Bootstrapping alternative:
	- Continue working without salary
	- Maintain full control
	- Could take significantly longer

### Competitive Landscape

- Recent market development:
	- Calibri Labs entering profit product space
	- Creates direct competition for Drew
	- Could make Drew more interested in joining as fifth partner
	- Could serve as potential data provider if Drew partnership doesn’t materialize
- Market positioning:
	- Only solution truly targeted at capital markets
	- Competitors focusing on asset management side
	- Unique combination of hospitality and multifamily technology expertise

### Timeline Considerations

- Summer typically slow for business decisions
- Target end of summer for either:
	- Securing funding
	- Generating bootstrap revenue
	- Beginning to pay team members
- Labor Day identified as key milestone for market activity resuming
