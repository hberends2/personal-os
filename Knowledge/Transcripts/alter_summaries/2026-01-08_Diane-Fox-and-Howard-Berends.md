	- Both hiring managers ~31-32 years old
	- Phone interviews went well, video interviews led to rejections
- Pivoting to consulting/advising focus
	- Revised LinkedIn profile for consulting
	- 3 consulting opportunities in pipeline
	- No longer applying for traditional employment roles

### New Business Opportunities

	- Need API for asset management lifecycle suite
	- Technology ahead of RedIQ but product behind
	- ~1/3 of RedIQ’s client base
	- Potential full-time or consulting partnership

	- Challenge: breaking news to strategic investor
- Second fintech opportunity
	- AI-powered cash flow tool for multifamily
	- Entrepreneur has funding, looking for product leader
	- Pre-seed stage but well-funded

### InnVestAI Status & Strategy

- Product development progress
	- Howard rebuilt the InnVestAI underwriting/valuation model after Q4
	- Current flow: create a deal → input property and financial data → go to valuation page → input underwriting assumptions → outputs flow into investment summary
	- Investment summary page now calculates IRR, cash-on-cash return, and other core metrics
	- Remaining work: refine some calculations/edge cases and polish a few pages to reach a fully functional MVP-ready model
- Howard’s role and time allocation
	- Howard wants to stay involved with InnVestAI but is rethinking his formal role (e.g., strategic consultant vs. managing/non‑voting partner vs. product-only role)
	- Open to taking a smaller equity stake in exchange for a lighter governance/decision‑making role
	- Believes he can support InnVestAI in a part‑time product role while also pursuing 2–3 other consulting/product opportunities
- Multiple income stream approach
	- Plan is to pursue three parallel opportunities (Archer, fintech cash‑flow tool, InnVestAI) for the next ~6 months
	- Will reassess and rebalance time commitment if one opportunity becomes a major time sink or clear winner
	- Sees equity positions (including InnVestAI) as key to longer‑term post‑W2 income; weighing trade‑offs between larger equity with heavier involvement (e.g., ~20%) vs. smaller equity with a lighter role (e.g., ~5%)

### Partnership & Go-to-Market Plans

- Otelier (formerly My Digital Office) strategy
	- Diane reconnected with Matt Curry (former Head of Sales & Marketing at My Digital Office / now Otelier) from her CBRE days
	- Otelier currently pulls and structures data from operators and already holds ~10,000 P&Ls in a very structured format
	- They also have a budgeting platform (fixed vs. variable expenses) and an existing security/CISO function, plus a ~100-person technical team in Sri Lanka
	- Diane believes Otelier could serve as a direct replacement for what was originally expected from ProfitSword/Drew: data ingestion, normalization, and budgeting backbone
	- Concept: expand Otelier’s current stack into an underwriting + financial analysis platform (InnVestAI) layered on top of their data
	- Matt indicated Ali (Otelier’s founder/chairman) is “one of the best humans on the face of the planet” and likely open to the idea; Matt is willing to help with reconnaissance and framing
	- Goal with Otelier: start with a small, concrete ask around data extraction/structuring and operator connections, with potential to evolve into a deeper strategic partnership or co‑build
- Strategic networking & sequencing
	- Diane is prioritizing careful partner vetting after prior co‑founder issues; wants to avoid “another Mark” situation
	- Step 1: leverage relationship with Sloan Dean (former COO of Ashford Hotels; has a tech focus and runs the “Not Done” podcast)
		- Ask Sloan for: light mentoring on the refreshed InnVestAI concept, feedback on the new pitch deck, and at least one strategic introduction
	- Step 2: Hotel Equities
		- Sloan to ideally intro InnVestAI to the CEO of Hotel Equities (tech background, multiple successful exits, mentioned he might have “one more startup” in him) and/or other leaders
		- Hotel Equities runs a tech “lab” platform and is already an Otelier client, making them a logical design/launch partner
		- Potential path: position Hotel Equities and Driftwood as initial pilot customers whose data and workflows help shape the product
	- Step 3: Otelier
		- After validating the story with Sloan/Hotel Equities, approach Ali/Otelier with: a sharpened pitch, evidence of operator demand, and a modest initial ask around data plumbing and security
- Driftwood Capital integration potential
	- Diane is working with Driftwood, who are building their own valuation model (currently likely in Excel) and running sophisticated mission control dashboards in Sigma
	- Driftwood has broad hospitality relationships and could:
		- Serve as an early adopter/pilot for the InnVestAI valuation and asset management model
		- Provide product feedback and domain expertise
		- Potentially help identify a technical co‑founder or senior technical leader through their network
	- Diane has $10k from Driftwood already sitting in an InnVestAI account and wants to honor/roll that into any rebooted structure
- Appraisers vs. lenders focus
	- Diane and Howard discussed whether to pursue CBRE/Appraisal workflows as a primary wedge
	- Howard’s view: appraisers are a smaller and more highly regulated market with heavy customization needs; pursuing them too early risks large tech debt and distraction
	- Agreed priority: focus first on lenders, investors, and operators (e.g., Driftwood, Hotel Equities) as initial high‑value customer segments; appraisers are a lower‑priority, later‑phase market
- Technical partnership considerations
	- Critical lesson from v1: data extraction and normalization took far longer than expected and became the main bottleneck
	- Howard emphasized that restarting data extraction from scratch could add 6–9+ months; solving this through Otelier or another specialized partner is key
	- Several possible technical structures:
		- Strategic partnership with Otelier for data ingestion + security
		- Three‑way partnership between InnVestAI, Otelier (data), and a group like Driftwood/Hotel Equities (design partners/pilots)
		- Contract or hire a separate data/ML team if Otelier path doesn’t materialize

	- Drew paying attorney costs out of pocket
	- Hoping post-holiday settlement discussions
	- May need to disband InnVestAI entity if required
- Operational preferences
	- Google Workspace over Microsoft for collaboration
