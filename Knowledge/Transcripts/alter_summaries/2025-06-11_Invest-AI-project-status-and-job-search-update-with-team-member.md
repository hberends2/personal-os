### Project Updates

- Cloud project approaching go-live date causing increased workload pressure
- InvestAI project getting less attention due to cloud project demands
- Need to clarify ADR/POR calculations with Diane and Drew
	- Howard has correct calculations but wrong abbreviation
	- Drew indicated ADR and POR are nearly identical (both for occupied rooms)
	- POR likely excludes comped rooms, but data only shows total rooms vs rented rooms
- Development environment sufficient for demos - no need for investai.com URL yet

### Technical Implementation Details

- Created dropdown box for ADR/revenue selection
- Frontend development progress:
	- Landing page in development
	- Deal details/pipeline page in progress
	- Can link demo environment through pipeline listing
- Howard sent UI screenshots via email for reference/inspiration
- Need to determine hosting solution eventually

### Payment Issues

- Team member experiencing delayed payments (2-month payment policy)
- Visa-holding company not receiving payments
- Issue raised during last week’s meeting with Diane
- Impact on personal finances (rent, groceries, transportation)

### Personal Updates

- Howard at cottage (45 minutes from home)
	- Property currently for sale
	- Had open house on Saturday with some visitors
	- Potential for Airbnb (technically not allowed but not enforced)
- Job search update:
	- Focusing specifically on Product Manager roles in real estate
	- Limited opportunities (1-2 relevant postings per day)
	- Meeting scheduled tomorrow at 11am with Nancy Reddy’s contact in commercial real estate
