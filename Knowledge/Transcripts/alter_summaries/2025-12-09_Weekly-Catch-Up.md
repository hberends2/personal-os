### Current Status & Transition Plans

- Howard stepping back during holidays but not dropping out completely
	- Surprised by Vinod’s sudden “I’m done” email after previous conversations about waiting through holidays
	- Will remain available for calls with Mike, Jessica, Mark Woodworth
	- Currently interviewing for two positions (one 4-day work week, one more intensive)
- Vinod appears definitively out
	- Used exact cease & desist language about “erasing Howard’s name”
	- Possibly contacted directly by Drew/Mark to join their effort instead
	- Risk-averse about legal involvement, concerned about visa implications
	- Howard disabled Vinod’s Teams access along with all other former partners

### Potential Technology Partners

- Ali Malu / Otelier as primary option
	- Has existing data processing, security infrastructure, CISO
	- Wife’s family in hotel ownership - understands real estate
	- Already built budgeting platform using drivers (penetration analysis, etc.)
	- Could adapt budgeting module to underwriting use case within one month
	- Would need strong pitch deck showing clear MVP path and sizeable long-term opportunity
- David B as possible partner for operating statement extraction
	- Howard’s contact who created Radix competitor
	- Processes complex multifamily operating statements
	- Potential partnership/client relationship rather than internal development
	- Cross-selling opportunities possible
- Driftwood connections as backup option
	- Could potentially source software engineer through their network
	- Would require paying Vinod for source code transfer

### Source Code & IP Situation

- Howard retains proof of concept on his computer
	- Sufficiently different from Vinod’s work to avoid ownership disputes
	- Contains the core mathematical model
	- Only valuable Vinod contribution was data extraction setup
- Teams access locked down
	- Disabled Vinod, Raj, Drew access to protect PRD documentation
	- Will restore if legally required by settlement
- Monthly payments to Indian engineering team
	- Vinod confirmed no November/December payments needed
	- Possible Drew is covering costs to maintain relationship

### Settlement & Legal Concerns

- Week since response letter sent with no attorney reply
- Concern Drew may be delaying while recruiting Vinod
- Howard complied with all cease & desist requests
- Plans to directly ask Vinod about any Drew contact
- Settlement resolution needed before major forward movement
