### Product Management Process & Workflow Clarification

- Discussed process when stakeholders bypass product management to directly engage engineers
	- Drew’s email with redesign of POC prompted discussion
	- Howard explained product management workflow to maintain structure
		- Internal/external stakeholders (including Vinod) provide ideas
		- Product works with engineering to prioritize features
		- Engineers build based on prioritized requirements
- Product documentation process already established
	- PRD exists for every feature in InnVestAI AVM
	- Documentation includes detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, screenshots
	- Documentation critical for future maintenance and engineering transitions
	- Located in InnVestAI folder under development/product/AVM PRDs
- Howard clarified roles
	- Product focuses on “what and why”
	- Engineering focuses on “how”
	- Both work collaboratively, not individually

### Team Dynamics

- Discussed technical knowledge spectrum within team
	- Mark: Business-focused, less technical
	- Renee: Business processes, underwriting knowledge
	- Drew: Middle ground with data expertise, documentation-oriented
	- Howard: Most technical, product management
	- Vinod/Engineering: Most technical side
- Drew’s documentation orientation stems from past experiences
	- Had failures with his own company’s CTO
	- No one on team has worked with a product manager before
	- Howard will show Drew existing documentation process

### Development Timeline & Testing

- Current timeline discussion
	- Vinod believes Labor Day is achievable for MVP
	- Howard initially thought mid-September
	- Team can begin testing individual features as they’re completed
	- Plan for August: “Build and test, build and test”
	- Early testing helps identify issues before final delivery

### AI Implementation Strategy

- Discussed AI capabilities and implementation timeline
	- Need to set realistic expectations about AI features
	- Can extract text from OMs now with high confidence
	- Financial data extraction accuracy around 93-95% currently
	- Within 6-12 months could auto-populate ~80% of AVM
	- Users would just verify and adjust as needed
	- Need to balance costs against revenue potential for features

### Feature Considerations

- Incentive fee calculations need to be addressed
	- Various calculation methods exist (5-10 standard ways plus custom)
	- Especially important for large brand-managed hotels
	- Could be handled through document upload and GPT analysis
	- Need to consider implementation costs vs. revenue potential

### Dashboard Design

- Discussed dashboard approach
	- Entry dashboard should show broad, informational metrics
	- Dashboard should be its own destination with user-customizable widgets
	- Different user types (asset managers, lenders) need different views
	- Avoid “vanity metrics” that create noise without user value
