	- 13 years on technical side starting with RealPage centralized data warehouse
	- Product manager at RedIQ (Berkadia’s multifamily underwriting tool)

### Industry Analysis - Why No Hotel AVM Exists

- Hospitality operates as isolated sector despite being commercial real estate
	- “Island of Granola” mentality - feels superior due to data complexity
	- Forgets connection to broader CRE asset class
	- Other sectors built sophisticated tools while hotels remained behind
- Market size limitations create chicken-and-egg problem
	- “Hospitality too small for CBRE to care about”
	- “Too small for DealPath to care about”
	- Major real estate technology companies won’t prioritize hotel solutions
	- Creates opportunity for specialized players but limits resources
- Structural and operational barriers to technology adoption
	- Hotel industry traditionally slow to adopt new technology
	- Quick volatility and complexity make people nervous about new tools
	- Different financial statement structure vs other CRE (no rent rolls equivalent)
	- Retail-like aspects with short-term stays create unique challenges
	- Labor-intensive data extraction discourages innovation in other asset classes
- Technology comfort zone issues
	- Industry extremely comfortable with Excel despite known error risks
	- Excel formulas get overridden and forgotten, creating hidden calculation errors
	- Manual copy/paste workflows accepted as normal despite inefficiency
	- Resistance to moving away from familiar tools even when better options exist

### Technical Product Overview - InnVestAI Architecture

- Core MVP functionality combining two proven concepts
	- Pipeline management system (like DealPath)
	- Automated valuation model (like RedIQ approach for multifamily)
	- AI-driven data extraction eliminates manual copy/paste workflows
- Data processing and extraction capabilities
	- Drop spreadsheets/financial statements directly into platform
	- AI extracts and processes all relevant data points automatically
	- Populates underwriting models without manual formula copying
	- Reduces underwriting time from days to fractions of original time
	- Success rate improving weekly, exceeding initial expectations
- Software architecture and user experience
	- Browser-based platform moving away from Excel dependence
	- Version control and collaboration features unavailable in spreadsheet workflows
	- Migration strategy: Start with Excel inputs/outputs, transition to full in-software work
	- Ready for client demos beginning December or early January 2025
- Advanced AI and integration roadmap
	- Howard developing separate valuation engine in spare time
	- Agentic AI relationships with operational software providers
	- Forward-looking forecasting capabilities beyond basic AVM formulas
	- Machine learning improving accuracy with each data point processed

### Market Approach & Competitive Strategy

- Tiered approach starting with volume-friendly segments
	- Initial focus: Select service hotels requiring high-level underwriting
	- Target users who underwrite 100+ deals quickly vs detailed analysis
	- Select service easier to value using ~10 comparables efficiently
	- Build market penetration before tackling complex repositioning deals
- Advanced capabilities for sophisticated underwriting
	- Deep segmentation analysis breaking apart transient/group/corporate rates
	- Integration with revenue management platforms (Lighthouse, Demand360)
	- Seasonal modeling and compression month analysis
	- Market penetration analysis using tools like Noland data for group strategy validation
- Addressing “secret sauce” concerns in luxury/repositioning deals
	- Bill’s insight: Luxury deals more predictable than full-service
	- Complex repositioning requires understanding future customer mix changes
	- Value-add acquisitions need deeper dive into operational possibilities
	- Software speeds data aggregation so analysts can focus on complex analysis
- Management company partnership strategy
	- Target underwriting teams at major management companies
	- Integrate comparable data from multiple management company platforms
	- Provide unified underwriting environment with integrated comp access
	- Address current pain point of scattered data across different systems

### Data Integration & Forecasting Framework

- Market forecasting data relationships critical for accuracy
	- Mark’s original model: 80% of hotel performance tied to overall market behavior
	- Covered 65 largest MSAs with 600 sub-markets at peak
	- Current data partnerships: LARC interested, CBRE Horizons being discontinued
	- Need credible third-party validation for deal completion
- Three-attribute framework for forecasting credibility (Mark’s criteria)
	- Must be understandable - simple structure, not overly complicated
	- Must be believable - achievable claims, not overselling capabilities
	- Must provide third-party validation sophisticated users can rely on
- Revenue management and operational data integration
	- Agentic AI relationships with Lighthouse, Demand360 platforms
	- Segment-level forecasting (bar rates, discount rates, group potential)
	- Integration with PMS and revenue management systems for forward-looking data
	- Concern about AI disruption changing booking patterns over next 5 years
- Granularity vs usability balance lessons from Jeremy’s Caliber experience
	- 19 rate categories proved 14 too many for underwriters
	- Detailed segmentation valuable but overwhelming for acquisition analysis
	- Bad data more exposed at granular levels, hurting credibility
	- Need to balance operational detail with underwriting practicality

### Benchmarker Revival & Comprehensive Workflow Vision

- Strategic opportunity with CBRE’s abandoned Benchmarker product
	- Mark created original product, now orphaned by CBRE research division closure
	- Potential partnership to resurrect with AI-powered data extraction
	- Management companies need integrated benchmarking in underwriting workflow
	- Robert Mandelbaum relationship status unclear, Will Webster conversations initiated
- End-to-end deal workflow automation vision
	- Pipeline management + valuation (current focus)
	- Renovation/capex workflow integration targeting Procore, NorthSpray users
	- Legal workflow digitization through Harvey platform partnerships
	- Closing statement integration for HUD/title company workflows
- Revolutionary cap rate database potential
	- HUD statements contain actual purchase prices (not adjusted/estimated)
	- Combined with underwriting NOI data provides true cap rate calculations
	- First honest, comprehensive actual cap rate database for hospitality
	- Current cap rate information often adjusted/unreliable when shared informally
- Management company integration benefits
	- Unified underwriting environment across multiple management platforms
	- Integrated comparable data access eliminating platform switching
	- Collaborative workflows with version control
	- Training programs for improved revenue underwriting skills
