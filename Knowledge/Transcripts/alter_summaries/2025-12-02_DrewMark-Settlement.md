### Legal Strategy & Settlement Planning

- Mike Sherman (attorney) advising on cease & desist letter response
	- Remove “not making legal conclusions” paragraph opening
	- Start directly with “without admitting” language
	- Send revised letter to attorney only, avoid direct contact with Drew/Mark
- Settlement negotiation approach
	- Let opposing party make first offer
	- Preserve all data on external drive before database deletion
	- Database purging in process (Drew’s uploaded spreadsheets need removal)

### Data Management & IP Concerns

- Current data status
	- Drew’s client data only in Excel spreadsheets + test uploads to model
	- Mark contributed zero financial data (confirmed in Drew’s budget spreadsheet)
	- No formal IP agreements exist between parties
- IP ownership clarification
	- Code authors retain ownership without written assignments
	- Vinod’s team created the source code
	- Drew potentially violated client confidentiality by sharing hotel data without consent

### Settlement Financial Framework

- Proposed baseline: $75K safe note ÷ 5 = $15K each maximum
	- Drew deserves reimbursement for actual contributions ($7,500 confirmed)
	- Mark contributed $0 but still entitled to settlement to avoid litigation costs
	- Bankruptcy protection for company essential in any LLC structure
- Negotiation leverage
	- Drew’s unauthorized use of client data creates liability exposure
	- Mark’s non-participation weakens his position
	- Litigation costs would exceed settlement amounts

### Mark Woodworth Communication

- Drew contacted Mark Woodworth, causing business concerns
- Mike explained situation to Mark, who remains supportive but worried
- Howard to send reassurance email to Mark confirming resolution plan
- Critical to prevent fraud allegations from spreading in industry

### Vinod Protection Strategy

- Keep Vinod completely out of legal proceedings
- His wife may be technical LLC owner due to visa considerations
- Drew/Mark aware of this arrangement from LLC drafting discussions
- Settlement agreement must include waiver of all claims against Vinod

### New LLC Structure Planning

- Cannot execute until Drew/Mark settlement complete
- Simplified approach needed (previous version too complex)
- Key provisions required:
- Mike’s role: non-voting economic interest focused on legal/financial operations
