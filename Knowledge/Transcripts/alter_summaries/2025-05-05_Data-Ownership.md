### Key Discussion Topics with Drew’s Data Integration

- Drew currently owns 2,500 hotel property records in his database (only ~3.7% of 68,000 total market)
- Drew currently positions himself as a vendor rather than partner
- Drew gets data through partnerships with operational BI companies and direct from hotel brands
- Need to clearly establish data ownership when Drew’s data enters InvestAI database
- Team wants to approach Drew about deeper partnership/integration but timing is strategic

### Technical Integration & Alternative Options

- Team can replicate Drew’s data mapping capabilities if needed
- Alternative data sources identified:
	- Direct from hotel operators/brands (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etc.)
- Hotel management companies typically have:
	- Full P&L data if they manage property
	- Only top-line revenue data if just franchising
- Only ~120 institutional-level management companies to potentially integrate with
- Need to develop API connections for automated data collection

### Business Model & Market Opportunity

- Platform serves multiple user personas:
	- Acquisition teams
	- Lenders
	- Asset managers
	- Appraisers
	- Brokers
- Brokers represent key initial marketing target because:
	- Can create and share models with multiple investors
	- Would be incentivized to use platform
	- Could create “Zillow of hotels” marketplace concept
- Current market focus on refinancing vs acquisitions due to market conditions

### Data Strategy Considerations

- Must avoid CoStar-type cease & desist issues around data reselling
- Need clear terms about data ownership once in InvestAI system
- Planning to allow data sharing but with opt-out options
- Value proposition increases with more data sources/users

### Team Dynamics & Roles

- Mark (former broker):
	- Strong capital markets connections
	- Currently views product narrowly as acquisition tool
	- Could be valuable evangelist to broker community
- Team needs to better educate Mark on full platform potential
- Howard developing detailed workflows to illustrate broader use cases
