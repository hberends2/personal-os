### InnVestAI Product Demo & Feedback

- Cap rate calculation flexibility
	- Jim suggested reverse calculation: input purchase price, develop income iteratively
	- Currently calculates cap rate from NOI/price
	- Would help with dynamic underwriting as assumptions change
- Mezzanine financing integration capability confirmed
- Post-NOI waterfall analysis
	- Complex feature, potentially tackled later in roadmap
	- Paraview company doing similar investment management SaaS with Juniper Square integration
	- Excel waterfall errors are widespread industry problem
- AI integration philosophy: build vs. partner vs. buy approach
	- Partnership strategy prioritized over in-house development
	- Driftwood investor supports company-of-companies model

### C&W Benchmark Acquisition Opportunity

- CBRE shutting down entire hotel research group (Horizons, Benchmark products)
	- Mark Woodworth and Robert Mandelbaum connections available
	- 8,000 hotels in Benchmark database (major brands: Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Vainbridge, Concord, Davidson)
- Potential resurrection strategy
	- Partner with Woodworth/Mandelbaum before data dies
	- Could provide benchmarking capability within 3-6 months
	- Robert Mandelbaum departing December 31st, potential hire at $150K
- Strategic importance: anonymized aggregated hotel performance data would be game-changing

### Data Integration Strategy

- STR code currently primary hotel identifier
	- AHLA working on unified identifier for operations (travel tech focus)
	- Opportunity to extend concept to real estate side for PCA/ESA connectivity
	- Potential networking opportunity with AHLA working group
- API partnerships expanding
	- Current: LARC relationship established

	- Western Alliance, Access Point Financial, Peachtree expressed interest
	- Blackstone/Brookfield-type firms need transparency for retail investor reporting

### Partnership Proposal & Next Steps

	- Equity partnership opportunity without upfront investment
- Current team gaps
