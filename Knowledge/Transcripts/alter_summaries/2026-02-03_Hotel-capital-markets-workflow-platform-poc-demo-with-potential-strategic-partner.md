### Company Background & Partnership History

- Diane and Howard became partners after meeting through Jared Kelso at Berkadia
	- Diane had spent two years at CBRE developing hotel capital markets platform concept
	- CBRE declined to invest $2-4M in acquiring Actable or Otelier for hotel capital markets
	- CBRE subsequently shut down their hotel research group, with Rachel Rothman joining Hot Stats as CEO
- Howard previously managed RedIQ at Berkadia
	- RedIQ was sold to Radix, which was involved in Real Page class action lawsuit
	- Radix laid off most RedIQ staff in January 2025, keeping only one engineer
	- RedIQ struggled with outdated .NET infrastructure and manual processes

### Current Company Status

- Recently separated from two co-founders over Thanksgiving due to disagreements
	- Had five equal co-founders initially - described as “rookie mistake”
	- Disagreements over bootstrapping vs. raising capital and MVP timeline
	- Settlement agreement to be signed within 1-2 weeks
- Rebuilt proof of concept (POC) from scratch over holidays
	- Not an MVP yet, but functional POC demonstrating core capabilities
	- Howard emphasized filling gaps from original POC rather than replicating
