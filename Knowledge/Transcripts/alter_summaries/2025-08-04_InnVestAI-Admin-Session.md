### Dan Lesser & LW Hospitality Background

- Dan Lesser: One of 5-10 top “hoteliers of the hoteliers” in industry
	- Partnership with Evan Weiss at LW Hospitality
	- Career pattern: CBRE → Cushman & Wakefield → original HVS
	- Took entire hotel advisory practices and all clients when leaving each firm
	- Dan highly visible: frequent LinkedIn posts, industry speaking engagements
	- Evan rarely posts but handles operational side of business
	- Evan reportedly earns $700k+ annually (more than Tom Edwards at CBRE)
- Team structure heavily weighted toward appraisal work
	- Large team of young analysts “cranking out appraisals” (80% of business)
	- Geographic territories: Dan/Evan worked NYC office with Northeastern Valuation head
	- Strategic vulnerability: Fee compression from AVMs entering appraisal market
- Additional revenue streams:
	- Asset management (less active than competitors like Single Pane owner)
	- Advisory services with significant profits
	- Expert witness/dispute analysis work (“boatload of money” but “very stressful”)
- Lark subsidiary: Predictive analytics and GIS capabilities
	- “Really getting lion’s share of people wanting this data”
	- Strong GIS program capabilities
- Investment interest: Dan personally interested (not necessarily full LW commitment)

### Client Pitch Deck Development & Team Coordination

- Mark’s comprehensive talking points creation
	- Covered all key client messaging elements
	- Drew converted Mark’s content to AI-generated slides in 3 minutes using AI slide generator
	- Blue color scheme preferred (matches InnVestAI logo colors)
- Presentation strategy for Dan Lesser call:
	- Drew leading discussion (originally established Ryan connection)
	- Mark providing commercial insights (first time seeing him pitch)
	- Howard handling product/technology components
	- Screenshots from Howard to be integrated by Drew
- Title structure finalized after team discussion:
	- Drew: COO (preferred over “Analytics Officer” - maintains current company status)
	- Mark: Chief Commercial Officer (self-selected)
	- Howard: Product and Technology
- Multiple spelling corrections needed:
	- InnVestAI format (capital I, lowercase i)
	- Howard’s last name misspelled throughout
- Deck versatility: Expected to evolve into standard client pitch version

### Investor Pitch Deck Development Progress

- 50% completion using Peter Thiel-inspired template research
	- Template limitation: “literally 50% missing” from claimed Thiel format
- Completed sections:
	- Problem statement aligned with Mark’s client messaging approach
	- Comprehensive competitor analysis
	- Data ownership slide (anticipating inevitable investor questions)
	- Team section with photos (multifamily references to be removed to avoid confusion)
	- Milestone timeline despite long development period
- Sections requiring completion:
	- TAM (Total Addressable Market) and ARR projections with specific numbers
	- Pricing strategy focus (strategy vs. specific pricing numbers)
		- Avoid stating “$1,000/month” type specifics
		- Pricing will change significantly during next year of development
	- Financial projections slide (uncertain if keeping)
	- AI explanation: Predictive vs. generative, structured vs. unstructured data
- Target completion: End of week for full team review
- Presentation timeline: Begin investor meetings post-Labor Day
- Design considerations: PowerPoint vs. AI platform limitations
	- AI platforms struggle with dense slides, force high-level content
	- PowerPoint Designer tab available for template options
	- Blue color scheme preference matches logo

### Technical Development & Team Expansion Strategy

- AI engineer addition under consideration
	- Budget range: $150-180k annually (down from $250k+ pre-AI tools market)
	- Alternative approach: Junior product manager with AI tools experience
	- Decision point: Engineering team vs. product team placement
- Vinod’s development concerns:
	- Too many developers might create decision bottleneck
	- AI tools enabling faster development than roadmap decision-making
	- Need balance between development capacity and product direction
- API integration strategy clarification:
	- Not expecting “boatloads of APIs” as originally thought
	- Modern APIs increasingly plug-and-play vs. custom development
	- Database field mapping: Clients map their data to InnVestAI system
	- One-time setup creates ongoing automated data flow
- Agentic AI implementation explained:
	- Multiple AI “worker bee” agents handling specific tasks
	- Manager AI coordinates and consolidates agent results
	- Example: Tax information agent, sales data agent, market research agent
	- Provides source validation with clickable links to original data
	- Reduces hallucination through specific site targeting
	- Reference: Arts Hotel report using GenSpark as example
