### InnVestAI Company Overview & Market Problem

- Team composition: 5 cofounders working 6 months together
	- Diane (hotel investment background): 25 years buying/selling/business development + asset/portfolio management
	- Howard: Investment/asset management background in multifamily, 15 years in proptech
		- Previously at RealPage, utility billing platforms, most recently redIQ (multifamily AVM)
	- Chief Technology Officer: Also from redIQ background
- Core market insight: Hotels are decade behind broader commercial real estate in investment tools
	- Real estate professionals spend 25% of time manipulating data manually
	- Similar to “old school revenue management when everything was done by hand”
	- Current hotel data sources are inadequate (CoStar described as “crappy”, lodging econometrics not favored)
- Product strategy replicates successful CRE tools for hospitality
	- Pipeline management tools like Deal Cloud, Deal Path exist in broader CRE
	- 7-10 AVMs exist in multifamily, none purpose-built for hotels
	- No real estate-focused asset management platforms for hotels

### Product Development & Competitive Advantage

- Current status
	- Proof of concept completed, moving to MVP by Labor Day
	- AVM will be core product with automated data collection (no copy/paste)
- Unique value proposition: Forward-looking data collection
	- Users provide projections on future cap rates, lending rates by market
	- Creates proprietary dataset of forward-looking market intelligence
	- No other platform captures this predictive data from actual market participants
- Technology foundation
	- Plan for 100+ API integrations in future roadmap
	- Howard and CTO successfully built and commercialized redIQ (leading multifamily AVM)
	- RedIQ now facing increased competition, especially with AI advancement

### Funding Strategy & Challenges

- Current financial situation
	- Pre-seed stage, bootstrapping with personal funds
	- Current burn: ~$20-30K annually for offshore developers and tools
	- Not sustainable beyond end of year
- Immediate funding need: ~$500K for angel round
	- Total projected need: ~$4M over 2-2.5 years to reach Series A
	- Suggestion received to break raise into smaller chunks
- Team concerns about dilution as first-time tech founders
	- Strong domain expertise but new to technology company fundraising
	- Need advice on optimal capitalization strategy

### Jessica’s Assessment & Concerns

- Positive feedback
	- Loves the concept and market opportunity
	- Recognizes value of forward-looking data (references TravelClick’s Demand 360)
	- Strong founding team with hotel expertise + proven tech execution
	- Has contacts who built similar products and could add value
- Key concern: 5 cofounders structure
	- Makes venture investment more difficult to secure
	- Creates cap table constraints for future employee equity
	- Need to justify why each founder role couldn’t be filled by employee
- Interest in deeper involvement
	- Wants to introduce managing partners Anjali and Manish
	- They own Shashi Hotel Group with properties in Silicon Valley
	- Include Google headquarters hotel property
	- Have highest grossing ALOFs in Marriott portfolio for multiple years
