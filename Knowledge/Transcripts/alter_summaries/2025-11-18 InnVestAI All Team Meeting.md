### Announcements

- Diane is currently in Miami this week for budget meetings, possibly including meetings with Driftwood
- Expected return by Thursday, though full week schedule unclear
- Howard’s youngest child moved out in mid-August, officially entering empty nester phase

### Review of Progress

- Product development nearing completion with approximately 90% functionality working
- Demo readiness assessment revealed some remaining issues that would be noticeable to potential clients
- Original target completion was this week to enable year-end demos before holiday season
- UI/UX feedback from Howard has been completely addressed
- Most of Drew’s feedback points have been resolved

### Key Achievements

- Platform development has made significant progress and is very close to demo-ready state
- Core functionality is operational and ready for controlled demonstration
- Team coordination continues despite scheduling challenges and member availability issues

### Challenges and Adjustments Needed

- Funding and Financial Management
	- Drew has exceeded his $7,500 contribution and will soon exceed Mark’s additional $7,500 commitment
	- All expenses (AWS, GitHub, India team) currently coming from Drew’s personal account
	- Drew will no longer fund operations from personal funds without company reimbursement
	- Tax liability concerns: if Diane takes $15-17K as distributions, company collectively liable for 20% taxes on full $75K
- Governance and Legal Structure
	- LLC agreement remains unsigned, creating legal vulnerabilities
	- Safe note executed with Driftwood without proper corporate governance framework in place
	- Unclear whether Driftwood payment going to company or Diane personally
	- Need CPA for proper bookkeeping and tax management
- Communication and Team Coordination
	- Diane’s absence from recent calls creating decision-making bottlenecks
	- Too many sidebar conversations excluding team members
	- Need for all communications to include entire team to prevent miscommunication
- Product Demo Preparation
	- Remaining 10% of issues need resolution before client presentations
	- Tight timeline with Thanksgiving and December holidays approaching
	- Decision made to create controlled video demo rather than live presentation

### Action Items and Accountability for the Week Ahead

- Vinod: Email and text Diane to determine availability for Thursday call or earlier meeting
	- Include all team members on communications
	- Copy others on text messages for transparency
- Drew: Test platform thoroughly to identify specific items needed for demo completion
	- Create new deal to test all functionality
	- Provide exact list of remaining issues to Benoit for resolution
- Benoit: Complete all remaining demo-blocking issues within one week
	- Focus specifically on video demo requirements
	- Resolve UI/UX items and calculation display problems
	- Prepare to record demo video with corrected numbers if needed
- Mark/Howard: Prepare for video recording responsibilities
	- Develop scripted demo using consistent financial documents
	- Ensure KPIs and summary cards are properly populated
	- Create controlled environment presentation
- Team Decision Points for Thursday:
	- If no response from Diane, consider direct outreach to Driftwood
	- Evaluate signing LLC agreement without Diane’s participation
	- Determine next steps for business continuity
