### Product Development Status

- Current POC exists with working model where users can input/change numbers
- Cannot yet ingest historical data - limited by current development tools
- Vinod needs to move development off his laptop to enable broader testing
- Initial database/server setup estimated at ~$10k to enable MVP development
- Current development limitations:
	- Tool subscription maxed out by 7th (10 days early)
	- Some functionality broken (dropdown boxes removed)
	- Working with limited daily tokens

### MVP Requirements & Timeline

- Must include document processing capability
- Need automated data ingestion functionality
- Target: 18 months for full AI functionality
