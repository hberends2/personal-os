### Product Development Status

- Vinod has completed data extraction capability for property, financial, and market data
- Currently running on local environment, no immediate need for additional server capacity
- Timeline: Initial proof of concept targeted within 7-10 days
- Need to circulate additional questions regarding input order items

### MVP to Version 1 Strategy

- MVP must be intentionally simple - “should be embarrassed by it in 2 years”
- Crucial balance: Must provide enough value for users to change their current software
- No fixed cutoff between MVP and Version 1 - continuous improvement based on user feedback
- Will not charge initially until post-investor funding to maintain pricing flexibility

### Core Platform Architecture

- Account-level segregation for complete data privacy
- Individual user deal lists within accounts
- Automated data population from HVIS database
- Manual input options for non-HVIS properties
- Data flow: User inputs → Valuation model → Invest AI aggregated database

### Data Aggregation & Security

- All user data anonymized in aggregated database
- Market-level insights without revealing specific deal information
- Benchmarking capabilities once sufficient scale achieved
- Security emphasis: Data segregation by account ID
- Clear messaging needed around data privacy to avoid user concerns

### Reporting Functionality

- Standardized report templates planned
- Checkbox system for report component selection
- Key components:
	- Acquisition assumptions
	- Underwriting assumptions
	- P&L statements
	- Financing details
- Potential AI assistance for value creation narratives

### Revenue Opportunities

- Primary revenue from aggregated data insights
- Secondary revenue from model subscription
- Potential marketplace for deals
- Opportunity for lender/appraiser access fees
- Broker integration for deal sharing

### Market Context & Initial Users

- Current market: More refinancing activity than acquisitions
- Target initial users:
	- Debt platforms (P-tree, Noble)
	- Lenders processing high underwriting volumes
	- Potential clients including Starwood Capital (dissatisfied with current platform)
- Focus on serving both refinancing and acquisition use cases
