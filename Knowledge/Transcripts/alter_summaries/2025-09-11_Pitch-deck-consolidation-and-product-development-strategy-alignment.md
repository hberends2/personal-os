### Safe Note Discussion & Alignment

- Spoke with Diane to explain safe note in detail
- She now understands the concept better
- Working to align all parties on realistic short-term compensation expectations
- Will recap safe note structure on upcoming call to reset expectations

### Pitch Deck Consolidation Challenge

- Currently have two separate pitch decks
	- Diane’s investor-focused version
	- Mark’s expanded talking points version
- Core issue: Need agreement on fundamental business elements before creating pitch materials
	- Mission statement
	- Product definition
	- Business objectives
	- Cost structure
- Pitch deck is representation of vision, not the vision itself

### Deck Strategy Moving Forward

- Will need two distinct presentation types
	- Investor pitch deck
	- Client presentation deck
- Plan to create master template (25-30 slides)
	- Pull relevant slides for different audiences
	- First 3 slides (mission, problem, solution, features) universal for all presentations
- Will consolidate best content from both existing decks
- Use Pop AI to create visually appealing final version

### Product Development Structure

- Need clearer internal communication framework for weekly calls
- Proposed breakdown
	- Document scraping/extraction
	- AVM (automated valuation model) - not broken into sub-components
	- AI features (deal summary, market research)
	- Database diagrams
	- Infrastructure
	- Staffing
- Combine product and technology into single discussion category
- Focus on current work, completion timelines, challenges, resource needs
