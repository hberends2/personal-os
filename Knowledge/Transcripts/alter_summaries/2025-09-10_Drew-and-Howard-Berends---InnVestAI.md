### LARC Partnership & Data Integration

- Existing shared clients create cross-selling opportunity between InnVestAI and LARC
- Partnership structure details:
	- Free data access for existing LARC clients using InnVestAI platform
	- Non-LARC clients must purchase LARC subscription ($30K annually) to access data
	- Ryan (LARC founder) provides quarterly data files, trusts InnVestAI for proper client verification
	- Ryan open to customer list sharing and mutual introductions for business development
- Data delivery format:
	- Quarterly publications (202503, 202506, 202509, etc.) plus annual summaries
	- Each file contains historical data plus forward-looking projections
	- Supply/demand/revenue provided as raw dollar amounts requiring manual summation before calculating RevPAR/ADR/occupancy ratios
	- Critical: Cannot average ratios directly - must sum underlying numbers first, then divide
	- ~30-50 major markets covered (majority of hotels fall outside these designated markets)
- Data reliability advantage: LARC maintains consistent historical data unlike competitors who frequently revise past numbers without explanation

### Market Data Applications & User Workflow

- Primary use case: Property performance benchmarking
	- Compare individual property occupancy/ADR against market averages
	- Identify performance gaps (e.g., market 72% occupancy vs property 68%)
	- Diagnose issues: renovation needs, operational problems, brand mismatch, market share loss
	- Use market forecasts to project future property performance
- STR comp set integration: 5-10 direct competitors vs 1000+ market properties for granular comparison
- Three dashboard concepts from Drew’s sample analysis:
	- Year-over-year market growth tracking across multiple metrics
	- Forecast-over-forecast changes showing quarterly publication differences
	- Comprehensive market intelligence including wage growth, EBITDA margins, cap rates
- Additional data points previously unavailable: tax growth rates, hotel EBITDA margins, cap rate projections for investment analysis

### Geographic Market Definitions & Boundaries

- Market boundary ambiguity creates user decision points:
	- Anaheim market scope: unclear if includes Irvine, Costa Mesa, or neighboring areas
	- Dallas/Fort Worth listed as separate markets despite DFW metro connection
	- Mid-cities example (Arlington): major entertainment district between Dallas/Fort Worth with significant hotel inventory
- Distance-based relevance thresholds undefined:
	- How far from Las Vegas before Vegas data becomes irrelevant? 50 miles? 100 miles?
	- Users currently make subjective choices (LA market for nearby properties, US/regional averages for remote locations)
- Drew plans to clarify market definitions with LARC team

### Future Partnership Evolution Options

- Current free partnership sustainable due to Ryan’s small company flexibility and mutual benefit
- White-label resale opportunity available: $30K+ annual licensing for full data redistribution rights
- Potential revenue sharing structure for new client referrals (not currently pursued for simplicity)
- Advanced market intelligence development: Ryan building proprietary forecasting using STR/CoStar data, Oxford Economics/Moody’s macroeconomic indicators, correlated travel demand factors
- Portal integration planned: Direct links from InnVestAI to LARC reports for subscribed clients

### Safe Notes & Investment Framework

- Convertible loan structure explained (not equity sale):
	- Functions as loan with equity conversion option
	- Converts upon trigger events: $100K+ outside investment or one-year maturity
	- 25% conversion discount vs new investor pricing at conversion time
	- Principal + interest repayment if no conversion occurs
	- Only loss scenario: company failure during loan term
- Startup vs real estate investment differences:
	- Asset-light technology companies valued differently than asset-heavy real estate developments
	- Growth-focused reinvestment model vs fixed-return real estate approach
	- Examples: Amazon’s sustained losses while growing, Rocket Money’s zero-revenue-to-billions story
- Investor presentation requirements:
	- Monthly milestone tracking and budget management needed
	- Clear articulation of 6-12 month business plan with specific deliverables
	- Demonstration of progress against stated goals and timelines

### Team Compensation Realities & Priorities

- Current financial constraints require immediate solutions:
	- Diane as sole breadwinner facing significant financial pressure
	- Vinod with new baby adding family financial stress
	- Part-time employment consideration for founders needing immediate income
- Compensation priority rationale for investor discussions:
	- Vinod: Development work critical to product completion
	- Diane: Brought team together, sole breadwinner status
	- Howard: Supporting role in current development phase
- Structural requirements for investor acceptance:
	- Founder payments must be W2 payroll, not equity distributions
	- Investor funds designated for company growth, not founder withdrawals
	- Equity ownership percentages separate from current compensation discussions
- Founder equity vs execution compensation distinction: 20% equal shares reflect founding contributions, current work compensation should reflect immediate value delivery
