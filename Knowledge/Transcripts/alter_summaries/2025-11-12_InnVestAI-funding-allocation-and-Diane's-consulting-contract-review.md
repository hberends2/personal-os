### Fund Allocation Strategy

- Total funds available: $75,000 from Driftwood
- Current expenses already incurred: $8,300
	- Drew paid $7,500 personal funds (now depleted)
	- Howard: $900 reimbursement needed
	- Legal costs: $1,000+ (ongoing)
	- Cloud hosting/software: $2,400
	- Offshore engineering team: $2,600
- Proposed allocation through April:
	- Engineering team: $12,800 (covers through April, no additions)
	- Cloud hosting: covers through February
	- Loan repayment to Drew/Mark: $17,000 (2 months at $8,500)
	- Howard reimbursement: $900

### Diane’s Compensation Dispute

- Contract states $75,000 payable via SAFE note
- Confusion over monthly vs one-time payment structure
	- Diane expects $8,500/month (Nov-Dec, potentially longer)
	- If monthly through April: $51,000 of total $75,000
	- No monthly payment terms in SAFE note documentation
- Mark initially thought she wanted 85% vs actual $8,500 request
- Need clarification meeting with Diane on payment structure
- Current team agreement: no salaries until revenue

### LLC Structure & Governance

- Vesting schedule discussion
	- 3-year vesting: 1/3 each year
	- Diane initially wanted exemption for herself
	- Prevents equity loss if partners leave early
- Job descriptions needed to establish swim lanes
	- Current LLC allows everyone to weigh in on all decisions
	- Proving problematic in practice
- Driftwood expectations unclear
	- Need direct meeting with Driftwood investors
	- Concern over unverified commitments Diane may have made
	- Risk to Drew’s potential customer relationship
