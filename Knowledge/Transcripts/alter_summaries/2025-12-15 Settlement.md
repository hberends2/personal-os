### Settlement Offer Strategy

- Lawyer (Mike) called opposing counsel (Aaron) about cease and desist resolution
	- Aaron initially confused about the matter
	- Claims Mark and Drew “don’t want money, they want the code”
	- Aaron became defensive when challenged on fraud allegations
	- Call ended poorly with threats about defamation
- Settlement approach decided: Single option offer
	- No money changes hands
	- Mark/Drew get all source code and data
	- Howard/Diane retain InnVestAI LLC, domain, and company name
	- Includes non-disparagement and confidentiality clauses
- Code transfer logistics
	- Currently stored on GitHub (like Dropbox for code)
	- Vinod has physical access, needs to package for transfer
	- Offshore devs should prepare cleanest version possible
	- Any work done after November 25th to be rolled back

### Vinod’s Status and Concerns

- Howard spoke with Vinod directly after previous discussion
	- Vinod claims no contact with Drew/Mark
	- States he wants nothing to do with dispute and is “moving on”
	- Howard believes Vinod is sincere based on working relationship
- Potential risks discussed
	- Concern Vinod might collaborate with Mark/Drew using the code
	- Immigration concerns may influence Vinod’s decisions
	- Settlement will release all claims against all parties
- Vinod likely withdrawing from project voluntarily
	- Different life circumstances than when he started
	- May need separate agreement to formalize his exit
	- Doesn’t impact core settlement with Mark/Drew

### Next Steps

- Mike drafting settlement offer email this week
	- Single option: code transfer, no money, confidentiality clauses
	- Expects response by end of week
	- Goal to complete before holidays if accepted
- Howard to contact Vinod Monday
	- Confirm GitHub access and code packaging
	- Clarify his intentions regarding project participation
	- Ensure any post-November 25th work is excluded
- Two-week holiday pause planned
	- Focus on settlement completion first
	- Reassess partnership structure in January (potential 3-person vs 4-person deal)
	- Howard continuing development of improved version during break
