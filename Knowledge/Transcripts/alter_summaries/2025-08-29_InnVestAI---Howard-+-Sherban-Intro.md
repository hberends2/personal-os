### Sherban's Background & Introduction

- Long friendship with Diane - grew up same town (Avon Lake, Ohio), husband Mike best friends since age 4
- ADHD career path: engineering degree → Anderson Consulting → IBM → law degree (nights) → patent attorney → in-house general counsel
- Started ESOP trustee practice in 2023 while employed, quit within 4 months due to rapid growth
	- Noticed lack of client service in ESOP trustee space
	- Practice "exploded faster than expected"
- Planning AI software development for ESOP space in 2026
	- Registered 4 domain names last week
	- Taking IBM Generative AI Engineering course on Coursera
	- Will outsource development but wants technical understanding

### Howard’s Background Overview

- Born/raised Grand Haven, Michigan; lived Texas/Colorado for career
- 30+ years commercial real estate, specifically multifamily sector
- Started ground-up: site manager → asset management → VP Asset Management at BH Management Services (top 15 US operator)
- Transitioned to tech via RealPage (largest multifamily software company)
	- Subject matter expert bridging business and technical sides
	- “Can read code like Spanish - understand but can’t speak it”
- redIQ experience (largest multifamily AVM, 60% market share)
	- Recruited 2021, expanded beyond acquisition into asset management
	- Berkadia sold to Radix August 2023, then shut down innovation January 2024

### InnVestAI Market Opportunity

- Hospitality represents 6-7% of commercial real estate but highly interconnected
	- 80% Cornell hotel school graduates, franchise model dominates
	- Peak transaction year 2015: $35B with 2-2.5% closing costs
- Institutional asset management fees significant
	- Example: Clarion Partners earned $3M annually on $3B hotel portfolio (1% AUM)
	- Plus acquisition fees, disposition promotes
- Competitors digitized all property types except hotels
	- Hotels considered “hard and complex” for small asset class
	- Existing players started decade ago, now established with owner support

### Current Development Status & Team Bottlenecks

- MVP target: end of September (revised from Labor Day)
- Core team: 5 founders with resource constraints
	- Howard: full-time on InnVestAI
	- Vinod (CTO): has full-time job, works nights (major bottleneck)
	- 3 Indian engineers at $500/month - good Python skills, no real estate knowledge
- Vinod’s unique value proposition:
	- Full-stack engineer with design background
	- Real estate experience from redIQ
	- Document extraction expertise (moved from rules-based to AI/ML)
	- Existing working relationship with Howard

### MVP Product Specifications

- Core functionality: upload documents → extract data → input assumptions → valuation output
- Document extraction critical - must handle non-standardized formats
- Six user personas identified: broker, investor, appraiser, lender, loan servicer, asset manager
	- Different detail levels needed (top-line vs granular subcategories)
	- Accordion-style expansion planned
- Built using no-code tools (Lovable, Replit, Bold) for proof of concept
	- Indian team cleaning up code for production

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Closed beta: end September with known industry contacts
	- Side-by-side testing with existing Excel models
	- Focus on user journey intuition over output accuracy
	- 30-60 day feedback period
- Revenue generation target: Q1 2026 (60-90 days post-beta)
- Pricing positioned against CoStar’s $3K, 1-4 day turnaround for basic data
- AVM as “foot in the door” - real value in data aggregation

### Future Roadmap & AI Features

- Near-term AI enhancements:
	- One-click investment package generation
	- Goal-seek functionality for hurdle rates
	- Sensitivity analysis with sliders
	- Market data integration for 80-90% automated valuations
- 5-year vision includes workflow integration:
	- Legal (Harvey AI partnership potential)
	- Capital/renovation (Procore integration)
	- Closing process digitization for accurate cap rate data
- Security requirements: SOC 2 compliance mandatory for financial institutions
	- $60K consultant cost, 6-month initial process, ongoing audits
