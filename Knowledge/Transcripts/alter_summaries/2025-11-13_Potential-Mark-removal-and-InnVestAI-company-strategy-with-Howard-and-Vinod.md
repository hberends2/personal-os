### Driftwood Partnership & Funding Structure

- Secured $75k safe note from Driftwood as anchor investor
- Diane negotiating $8,500/month consulting arrangement with Driftwood
	- Covers personal expenses while building company ($500 in checking account currently)
	- Creates dual relationship: service provider + investor
	- Full $75k balance deposits to company bank account once established
	- Short-term stopgap until proper working capital raised
- Strategic value beyond funding
	- Access to Driftwood’s network for introductions
	- Participation in advisory panel with best technology companies in space
	- Industry validation as anchor investor for future fundraising
- Working capital needs: $500-750k projected
	- Covers Diane, Howard, Vinod salaries
	- Software engineers in India
	- Carrie for marketing support
- Timeline: Diane confident by January 1st can demonstrate relationship growth value

### Mark Partnership Crisis

- Diane no longer comfortable with Mark as co-founder after ~1 year
	- Creates more problems than solutions, too egotistical and cagey
	- Zero sales/fundraising deliverables despite promises
	- No customer outreach or investor meetings completed
	- Wants to bootstrap entirely, unfair burden on Howard/Vinod working full time unpaid
- Reputation concerns from Brian Waldman (Peachtree Hotel Group CIO)
	- Asked “don’t you know Mark’s reputation?” at lunch meeting
	- Known industry-wide as “hothead” who hangs up on people
- Recent incident: Mark raised voice throughout call, told Diane “don’t ever talk to me that way again” and hung up
- Historical pattern: Unprofessional dress-down when Diane was client at Lendlease over Sonnenblick/Jaill broker selection
- Current LLC structure risk
	- Mark loaned company $7,500 plus interest owed for clean separation
	- Delaware LLC currently under Diane’s name only (applied for EIN)
	- No signed LLC agreement yet, unclear equity claims under Delaware law
	- Email exchanges mention 20% equity intention but may not be legally binding

### Alternative Company Structure Options

- Primary proposal: Create new parent company/LLC
	- Leave InnVestAI LLC dormant to avoid Mark legal complications
	- Develop all technology under different entity name
	- Use InnVestAI as DBA later, retain domain name and branding
	- Clean separation without litigation risk
- Howard/Vinod own all technology infrastructure created to date
- Vinod’s H1B visa concerns about lawsuit exposure for entire family
- Risk assessment: Losing Drew likely if Mark leaves (90% chance Drew follows Mark)
	- Drew has own business, potential 10% chance stays if team proves more effective
	- Drew previously agreed Mark shouldn’t draw salary, frustrated with lack of progress
- Mark role limitation alternatives discussed:
	- Restrict to fundraising only with quotas/performance requirements
	- Remove from sales and go-to-market responsibilities
	- Commission-based compensation instead of salary for part-time work

### CBRE Benchmark Strategic Opportunity

- CBRE Hotels shutting down research group creates major acquisition target
- Existing benchmark product has 8,000 hotels dataset
	- 25 years of operator relationships built
	- Aimbridge (largest US third-party manager) feeds 1,000+ hotels monthly data
- Key personnel available: Mark Woodworth (original product creator 25 years ago), Robert Mandelbaum (relationship owner with every management company)
- Partnership structure: Robert Mandelbaum + Diane Fox approach management companies
	- Keep data flowing into new entity
	- Process P&Ls similar to current InnVestAI technology
	- Save years of data accumulation time
- Potential separate company structure to avoid Mark/Drew complications
- Could generate immediate revenue depending on deal structure
- Second meeting scheduled early December with Mark and Bill (CBRE contacts)
- Frustration: Strategic opportunity overshadowed by partnership disputes

### Peachtree Hotel Group Investment Interest

- Brian Waldman (CIO) lunch meeting discussed 75% MVP completion
- Requested $175k investment to finish MVP development
- Brian’s response: “That’s nothing for us, we spend way more on technology”
- Suggested better fit initially in debt/unstructured finance team
- Proposed introduction to team for MVP demonstration
- Validation of $200k safe note fundraising strategy
- Meeting derailed by Mark reputation discussion

### Decisions Pending

- Mark’s future role in company (stay with limitations vs. clean separation)
- New parent company structure vs. working within existing InnVestAI LLC
- Legal consultation needed on separation risks and Delaware law implications
- Drew’s likely departure if Mark leaves and mitigation strategies
- CBRE benchmark opportunity as separate venture vs. integrated product
- Timeline for decision making given Diane’s November travel schedule
