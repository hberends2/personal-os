### Labor Day Weekend & Location Update

- Howard staying extra night at lake property due to pleasant weather
	- High 70s temperatures, cool evenings in upper 50s
	- Wife brought supplies but didn’t stay overnight (comfort level)
	- Managing four animals with daily care requirements

### Product Strategy & Problem/Solution Reframing

- Shifted focus from traditional “wasted time” narrative to AI promise maximization
	- Problem: How to make most of AI promise in hotel investment
	- Three core challenges: agents, data model, security
- Solution positioning around agentic AI integration
	- Build hotel investment industry data model
	- Agents query both general LLMs and specialized data model
	- Security through InnVestAI wall - no direct user-to-internet connection

### Security & Data Architecture

- Data isolation at account level with unique IDs
	- Users only see own deals, never competitors’
	- Aggregated/anonymized database for market comps
- Minimum threshold requirements (3-5 properties) for comparables
	- Prevents identification of individual deals
	- Standard practice across real estate sectors
- SOC2 compliance now automated (5 days vs months)
	- Depends on data volume and client growth

### Persona Analysis & Development Timeline

- Break down roadmap by persona as requested
- Current focus: lenders, appraisers → investors, brokers → asset managers
- Estimated 9-12 months for basic AVM completion
- Additional personas identified:
	- Hotel operators (feasibility teams, ops teams)
	- Hotel brands (franchise administration, development oversight)
- AI team structure needed: specialized AI expert plus engineer

### Investor Deck & Funding Strategy

- Deck completion target: Sunday night
- AI-specific pages needed for problem/solution sections
- Initial company valuation set at $500K (Mike’s $50K investment)
- Fundraising timeline:
	- Next 6-7 months: $400K in $50-100K checks
	- Second friends/family raise for additional year
	- Series A targeting 24-month runway
