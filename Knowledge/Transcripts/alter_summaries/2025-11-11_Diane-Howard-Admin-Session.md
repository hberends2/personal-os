### Top of mind

- Lack of clear business plan and strategy disagreement among partners
	- No documented plan for customer acquisition or working capital needs
	- Conflicting views on bootstrapping vs. raising $750K-850K in safe notes
	- Drew controls budget conversations without full team alignment
	- Need to resolve how to handle disputes when the five partners can’t agree on strategy

### Updates and wins

- Jim Alderman call went very well
	- He’s well-connected and willing to make introductions
	- Could potentially get involved himself
	- Howard saw positive reaction when Jim mentioned names and potential introductions
- 4 PM call scheduled with Mark Woodworth and Bill Reynolds
	- Opportunity to discuss partnering on benchmarking product (Eva Interney 2.0)
	- Mark has established relationships with 8,000 individual hotels in US
	- Robert Mandelbaum leaving CBRE end December, likely joining Mark
	- Could provide data access and management company relationships
- Technology development progressing well
	- Can demo both pipeline management and performance pieces to Mark Woodworth
	- AVM has been successfully created after year of development

### Challenges and blockers

- LLC documentation creating friction
	- Drew pushing W2 requirement for payments vs. independent contractor approach
	- Original draft agreement too simplistic for five-member equal partnership
	- Complex issues around founder disputes, employee pools, bankruptcy scenarios not addressed
- Financial management issues
	- Howard has $900 out-of-pocket expenses needing reimbursement
	- Drew’s attorney complaining about $1,000 legal fees while potentially facing $25K in negotiations
	- No shared budget tool - only Drew has access to spreadsheet
	- Unclear how much Mark and Drew have actually invested financially
- Resource allocation concerns
	- Mark presenting alone in Phoenix without Howard present to hear his pitch
	- Concern about Mark only pitching loan servicing vs. full competitive advantage
	- SEC documentation requirements becoming bigger obstacle for large company customers

### Mutual feedback

- Howard agrees with Drew that LLC should be attorney-drafted rather than self-written
	- Should provide bullet points of desired changes and let attorney handle wording
	- Simpler approach may be better than trying to anticipate every possible issue
- Howard willing to create online budget tool to replace Drew’s spreadsheet
	- Would provide shared access with change logs
	- Include budget vs. actual tracking
	- Set spending limits requiring votes (majority for most items, supermajority for major decisions)
- Howard strongly opposes equal salary for part-time partners
	- If Mark and Drew only work 10 hours/week, should only receive 25% of full-time salary
	- “Hill I’m willing to die on” since this is already Howard’s full-time job

### Next Milestone

- Howard to review LLC agreement again before today’s call
- Create online budget tool integrated into CRM with:
	- Shared access for all five partners
	- Change logging and notifications
	- Revenue, investment, and expense tracking
	- Voting thresholds for different spending levels
- 4 PM demo for Mark Woodworth showing:
	- Pipeline management functionality
	- Performance piece capabilities
	- Proof that AVM has been successfully created
- Need to establish three equity pools: founders, employees, investors
- Resolve LLC voting structure (per person vs. per equity)
- Address salary structure for part-time vs. full-time partners
