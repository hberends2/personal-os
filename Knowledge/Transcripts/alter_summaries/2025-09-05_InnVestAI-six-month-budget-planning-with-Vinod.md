### Six-Month Budget Planning & Resource Allocation

- Total budget target: $500k for 6 months (October 2025 - March 2026)
- POC phase complete with minimal remaining expenses
	- Howard’s Lovable subscription: $40/month (increased from lower tier to handle current workload)
	- No other out-of-pocket reimbursements needed
- Current team compensation structure revised:
	- Vinod: $125k annually ($625/month) with 20% visa withholding reducing actual take-home
	- Howard & Diane: $102k annually each ($850/month each) - significant discount from market rate of $150k
	- Drew & Mark: compensation accruing with interest vs. current payout due to funding constraints
	- Founders accepting lower salaries due to larger equity stakes vs. employees getting 3-5% equity

### Engineering Team Expansion & Offshore Strategy

- Current offshore team budget increases approved:
	- Two junior engineers: $1,000/month each (doubled from current $400-500/month)
	- Senior engineer: $600/month part-time initially, scaling to $1,000/month after 2-3 months
	- All engineers currently underpaid but performance-based increases planned
- New offshore engineering team budget: $90k for 6 months ($15k/month)
	- Capacity for ~5 engineers including AI specialists at offshore rates
	- Rejected domestic AI engineer at $180k annually - deemed too expensive vs. founder salaries
	- Howard and Vinod confident in managing offshore team with time zone overlap
- Product manager consideration: $140k annually (increased from initial $130k)
	- May pursue offshore option for cost efficiency
	- Howard recommends hiring engineer before product manager
	- Both roles require equity compensation due to below-market salaries and no benefits

### Infrastructure & Technical Requirements

- Cloud hosting budget increased to $1,500/month (doubled from $750/month)
	- Current usage approaching $750/month limit
	- Expected to double again when opening platform to external users
	- Includes AI model hosting and development environment costs
- Tool consolidation strategy implemented:
	- Single infrastructure line item vs. Drew’s preferred phase-by-phase breakdown
	- Howard updated InnVestAI tools spreadsheet for reference
	- Eliminated separate cloud AI development line items (lines 26-38 removed)
- Additional operational expenses:
	- Email seats expansion: ~$14/month per new team member
	- Professional services: legal and accounting
	- Miscellaneous admin and regulatory compliance
	- SOC2 compliance preparation (deferred to mid-2026)

### Funding Strategy & Organizational Challenges

- Funding pipeline and valuation framework:
	- Need 2-3 additional investors at $50-150k each to enable full-time transition
	- Carlos and Sherben agreements in progress
	- Proposed company valuation: ~$30M based on 12-15% safe investor allocation method
	- Target metrics: $2.5-3.5M ARR within two years for Series A readiness
- Team dynamics and leadership concerns:
	- Mark’s networking value: connections to Dan Lesser, Glen Alba (ex-Blackstone)
	- Dan Lesser potential investment ($100-150k) would provide significant reputational value
	- Mark hesitant to leverage contacts until product demonstration ready
	- Drew managing stress from Hotel Biz challenges (lost Flynn client, no new clients in year, draconian partner agreement with Actus)
	- Leadership transition: testing Drew vs. Diane for Tuesday/Thursday call management
- MVP demonstration timeline pressure:
	- Phoenix Lodging Conference deadline end of month
	- Partial MVP demonstration capability expected, not full product
	- Mark needs education on realistic demonstration scope vs. complete product
