### Mark Separation Decision

- She will announce on tonight’s call: no longer working with Mark, won’t sign LLC
- Direct approach recommended vs. dragging out with excuses about needing review time
- Will not discuss separation terms during call - keep it brief (potentially 5 minutes)
- Legal assessment from her husband’s attorney friend:
	- No signed LLC means verbal/email commitments likely not legally binding
	- Delaware law research supports this position

### Drew Retention Strategy

- Unknown if Drew will walk away or try to salvage partnership
- She’s willing to work with Drew if no Mark communication required
- Need to convince Drew not to abandon project due to Mark issues
- Both have good relationship with Drew, should leverage this

### Benchmarker Partnership Opportunity

- CBRE dropping Benchmarker tool December 31st
- Lar (inventor, ~70 years old, industry veteran) angry about CBRE decision
- Partnership potential:
	- Revenue share model under consideration
	- Possible investor/partner/founder role for Lar
	- Existing client base: Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt
	- Lar will contact clients to redirect data uploads to new platform
- Technical considerations:
	- ~50 custom APIs (one per company)
	- May need to build “version 2” without copying IP
	- December timeline pressure - only 1 month to build
	- Fallback: export data to PDF/Excel for manual extraction
- Meeting planned with CBRE VP Paul and his data team

### Financial and Legal Arrangements

- Diane opened business account, deposited money
- Direct deposits now going to Brex account
- Separation agreement for Mark should include:
	- Some equity/financial consideration
	- Non-disparagement clause (both directions)
	- Similar to standard severance agreements
- Attorney friend available for legal support
