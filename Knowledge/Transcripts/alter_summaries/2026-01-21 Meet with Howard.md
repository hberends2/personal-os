	- Recent startup raised $40M at $120M valuation but burned through cash
		- Team relocated from Russia to Turkey/Slovenia/Poland/Georgia during Ukraine invasion
		- Company shut down with 24-hour notice to entire team

	- Worked with John Francois at Calypso for 8+ years
	- Currently in Aspen (worst snow season in 40+ years)

### Howard’s Multifamily Real Estate Background

- 15+ years product management in prop tech since 2011
- Started in multifamily operations/asset management
	- VP Asset Management at BH Management (#23 largest US multifamily company)
	- Developed 90-day rolling forecasts vs traditional 18-month budgets
- Real Page experience (multiple times due to acquisitions)
	- Built original “Central Reporting” - first aggregated database across siloed business units
- Recent role at RedIQ (largest multifamily investment valuation tool)
	- Created asset management suite extending beyond acquisition-only use
	- Built performance vs budget comparison tools for institutional owners
	- Sold to Radix in late 2024, then laid off entire RedIQ team in 5 days due to class action lawsuit pivot

### Market Opportunity Assessment

- Multifamily industry characteristics:
	- Huge industry but concentrated among institutional players
	- Small/mid-size companies lack resources for enterprise tools
	- Traditional tech laggards, accelerated adoption post-COVID
	- Real Page/Yardi dominate but expensive, focus on top 100 owners
- Pricing reality: Many smaller companies use QuickBooks instead of enterprise accounting
- ROI impact potential: Every $1,000 NOI savings = $20,000 property value increase (at 5% cap rate)

### Technology & AI Advantages

- Speed of development now vs traditional approach
	- Can build MVPs/prototypes much faster than before
	- Smaller teams can deliver enterprise functionality
	- Cost-competitive solutions for previously underserved market segments
- Enterprise requirements still apply:
	- Security, scalability, audit trails for enterprise data
	- Integration challenges with existing legacy systems
- Market positioning: Democratizing tools previously available only to large players

### Next Steps

- Howard to share notes from tonight’s call with John Tomlinson (retired Bell Partners CFO)
- Steve to research the three companies Howard mentioned
- Team to validate market needs through additional stakeholder conversations
- Steve meeting tomorrow with Aspen-based commercial RE manager ($1B assets, tokenization focus)
