## Enhanced Notes

### Settlement Agreement Update

- No response yet from opposing counsel (sent last Wednesday evening)
	- Typical for lawyers to take time at this stage
	- Expecting wording changes or transfer mechanics adjustments
- Execution process will involve PDF signatures
	- Sherban will coordinate signatures on their side
	- Howard and Diane will only sign signature pages (scan and return)
	- Five business day timeline for post-execution tasks
- Required transfers upon execution:
	- All InnVestAI domains (InnVestAI.com, etc.) via GoDaddy transfer portal
	- GitHub repository access (Vinod currently sole administrator)
	- Electronic logos and assets (JPEGs, PNGs) to be emailed and then deleted
- Auto-renew disabled on domains to create urgency (expires end of February)

### GitHub Access and Vinod Coordination

- Vinod has sole administrative access to GitHub repository
- Howard suggested call with Sherban and Vinod for proper handoff instructions
	- Vinod works full-time, available evenings after 5:30 PM
	- Meeting scheduled for tomorrow evening if possible (Sherban unavailable Wednesday-Friday, back Monday)
- Vinod separation agreement will be handled separately from main settlement
	- Simple one-paragraph relinquishment document
	- Not required for main settlement to proceed
- Strategic consideration: Vinod brings development speed but overhead concerns about his indirect ownership structure through wife

### Technology Infrastructure Decisions

- Current proof of concept built in Lovable, migrated to quad code
- Howard believes existing POC could serve as working model with engineering review
- Data extraction remains the critical missing piece for MVP completion
- Offshore development discussed as cost-effective option ($20-30k annually)
	- Contract-based to avoid employee overhead (workers comp, unemployment insurance)
	- AI tools making development more commoditized and cost-effective

### Data Ingestion Strategy and Partnerships

- Multiple strategic partnership options identified:
- Approach strategy: Initial vendor relationships vs. strategic equity partnerships
	- Howard advocates for vendor licensing model initially
	- Diane emphasizes keeping strategic investor doors open due to industry interconnection
- Three key advisory conversations scheduled for February:

### Business Operations Setup

- Company rebranding to “In Exchange” post-settlement
- Financial infrastructure planning:
	- Brex banking account already established and functional
	- Corporate credit card needed (Capital One Spark preferred over Brex secured option)
	- QuickBooks integration planned with Sherban managing financial operations
	- Google Workspace setup ($7/person starter package) for email and collaboration
- Operating agreement revision needed with Vinod’s departure
	- Single class of membership interests preferred for tax simplicity
	- Sherban proposing voting rights instead of economic-only interest

### Revenue and Go-to-Market Timeline

- Target market entry through debt and structured finance (highest underwriting standards)
	- Access Point Financial, Western Alliance Bank, Peach Tree Hotel Group identified
	- Driftwood both potential customer and lender
- Sales strategy concerns about SaaS vs. real estate expertise
	- Diane has industry contacts but lacks SaaS sales experience
	- Future need for prop-tech experienced salesperson with software background
- MVP timeline: 6-7 months iteration with handful of clients before broader market entry
- Driftwood opportunity: Internal valuation process for 50 hotels (potential test customer)

### Funding Philosophy and Constraints

- Clear rejection of bootstrapping approach
	- Diane emphasizes need for strategic investors over pure capital
	- All dilution decisions require unanimous agreement
	- No consultant services bundled with investment agreements going forward
- Howard’s concurrent opportunities:
	- Two potential startup involvements (one non-competing, one multifamily competitor to Rediq)
	- Possible employment opportunity with Rediq competitor
	- Maintaining commitment to In Exchange development

### Action Items

- Vinod coordination call scheduled (need to confirm timing with all parties)
- Google Workspace setup at $7/person for operational efficiency
- Working session scheduled for Monday, January 26th at 11:00 AM
	- Howard to demonstrate current proof of concept
	- Diane to present updated pitch deck developed with uncle’s GTM expertise
	- Prepare materials for February 3rd Sloan Dean conversation
