- Governance and documentation
	- Finalize OA with nine points, authority matrix, two‑signature rule, vesting, employment exhibits; attorney to draft within ~2 hours
	- Circulate OA for signatures with 24–48h deadline; failure to sign triggers alternate path below
	- Set up company bank account and designate ledger sub‑account for Driftwood SAFE proceeds
- Communication to Diane
	- Drew to send email (cc: all founders) stating consensus on the nine points, the OA timeline, and the two‑signature policy going forward
	- Provide 24 hours for questions; absent substantive changes, proceed to signatures
	- Shift away from 1:1s on governance/finance matters; use group calls or written threads to avoid misalignment
- Financial operations
	- Upon OA execution: deposit full $75k into InnVestAI account; immediately record up to $8.5k/month to Diane as company loan until payroll starts
	- Stand up payroll/W‑2 process; define founder comp policy tied to budget and runway
	- Maintain sources/uses and monthly reporting; ensure compliance for international payments (India team)
- If Diane refuses or misses deadline
	- Proceed with four operating members; convert Diane to non‑voting member with economic interest only (no operational authority)
	- Remove her signature requirement from OA; update cap table/economic terms accordingly
	- Continue operations, budgeting, and vendor payments under new governance
- Personal comms protocol
	- Howard to decline unilateral governance/finance discussions; redirect to group forum to prevent false consensus
