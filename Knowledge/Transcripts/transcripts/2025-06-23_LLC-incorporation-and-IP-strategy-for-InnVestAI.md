### Guest (2025-06-23T19:03:26.171Z)

Alright. So today, Howard, you suggested that should we go through

### You (2025-06-23T19:03:27.195Z)

suggested that should we go through operational or should we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:03:30.391Z)

operational, or should we spend our time talking more about

### You (2025-06-23T19:03:31.135Z)

spend our time talking more about like, the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:03:34.311Z)

like, the

### You (2025-06-23T19:03:34.915Z)

like, how harboring

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:03:36.081Z)

how we're getting incorporated and the trademark and those type of things.

### You (2025-06-23T19:03:36.625Z)

and the trademark and those type of things. What do think best use of our time.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:03:40.221Z)

Do you think is the best use of our time?

### You (2025-06-23T19:03:40.905Z)

Yeah. I think, you know, Vinod and I both pushed out some videos So I think last couple times we've been meeting we've spent pretty much the entire meeting going over the the the tools. So I think right now, you know, we've got some tweaks. In fact, Drew, I got your email just a little while ago, so I will be making those changes to the market comps. So unless there's something that you saw in either of either of the videos that were shared today, I think it would be best that we start spending more of these weekly meetings on preparing for what's next.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:30.491Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:32.105Z)

So Okay. Thanks. So let's just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:35.251Z)

Yeah. So then let's just

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:36.625Z)

jump in. Let's start with oh, I didn't even know. Were you gonna say something?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:37.761Z)

jump in. Let's start with oh, Vinoba, are you gonna say something?

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:39.495Z)

No. I'm good. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:40.671Z)

No. I'm good. Thank you.

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:42.085Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:43.291Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:43.965Z)

So let's start with the corporation. I think we we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:45.441Z)

So let's start with the incorporation. I think we we were

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:48.365Z)

were kind of on the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:49.931Z)

kind of on the

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:50.145Z)

on the thinking about two different things.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:52.011Z)

thinking about two different things, and so let's just talk about it as a group.

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:52.305Z)

And so let's just talk about it as a group. One, we were talking originally about just doing an LLC

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:04:55.791Z)

One, we were talking originally about just doing an LLC

### You (2025-06-23T19:04:59.585Z)

and incorporating

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:00.791Z)

and incorporating in Georgia just because I'm here.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:01.105Z)

in Georgia just because I'm here. Or we were talking about incorporating in Delaware and actually

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:04.631Z)

Or we were talking about incorporating in Delaware and actually

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:08.345Z)

incorporating as a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:09.541Z)

cooperating as a corporation.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:09.545Z)

corporation. It would do the labor

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:11.781Z)

If we do the later, you have to go through

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:12.495Z)

you have to go through an attorney who, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:14.891Z)

an attorney who, like, lives in Delaware to incorporate

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:15.845Z)

to do it. In Delaware. For for break. But, obviously, lots of firms.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:20.311Z)

obviously, lots of firms do that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:20.655Z)

Do that. So the one thing we were

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:23.141Z)

So the one thing we were kind of or least

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:24.385Z)

of or at least I personally was trying to just leave open

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:26.251Z)

I personally was trying to just leave open was,

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:28.125Z)

was doing the best that we can with our corporation for

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:30.541Z)

doing the best that we can with our corporation for

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:33.165Z)

with our immigration challenge.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:34.251Z)

Vinod's immigration challenges.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:35.085Z)

And I don't know I don't know what kind of

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:36.751Z)

And I don't I don't know. Kinda that's what's out there. So I'm ready to pull the trigger on

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:39.665Z)

out there. So I'm ready to pull the trigger on either one and go ahead

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:42.781Z)

either one and go ahead and do it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:42.825Z)

do it. I do know

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:44.671Z)

I do know that the name InnVestAI from a corporation perspective in Delaware is available. I did check that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:44.955Z)

the the InvestAI the from a I did check that. I'm sure it's available. In Georgia as well.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:53.651Z)

I'm sure it's available in Georgia as well. I think it's just a matter of deciding what

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:55.145Z)

And some active site 's happening. Go down.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:05:58.491Z)

path we wanna go down

### You (2025-06-23T19:05:59.965Z)

LLC or

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:06:00.201Z)

The LLC or

### You (2025-06-23T19:06:02.225Z)

an actual corporation.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:06:03.471Z)

an actual corporation

### You (2025-06-23T19:06:04.545Z)

In care.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:06:05.751Z)

in Delaware.

### You (2025-06-23T19:06:08.385Z)

Yeah. I I I know that we we did a lot of research, and there were some papers on there I don't have it in front of me specifically, so I don't really recall other than income tax, corporate income tax, the advantages of incorporating in Delaware versus elsewhere, But I'm also wondering, you know, every company, every software company that I've worked for has been an LLC. And I thought there's gotta be some type of a reason for it. Red IQ was an LLC. Radixx and and the other companies I worked prior to that. So I don't know.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:06:51.911Z)

We're

### You (2025-06-23T19:06:53.695Z)

I don't I I don't know. Is there an advantage from a software or a SaaS standpoint where an LLC is better than a corporation? Or I think a.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:03.571Z)

I think from what I've gathered, LLCs are just

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:04.045Z)

LLC. Easier.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:06.421Z)

easier to set me I mean, I say what I've got. I mean, LLCs are easier to manage

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:09.845Z)

Easier to manage.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:12.281Z)

They're, you know, they're less complex with fewer regulatory hurdles and

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:14.525Z)

Right. Right. So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:16.491Z)

tax requirements

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:17.155Z)

it's basically

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:17.631Z)

Right? So it's it's basically, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:17.965Z)

if you

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:19.311Z)

you could do an LLC very quick and dirty,

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:20.425Z)

and I think in the technology world,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:21.721Z)

And I think in the technology world, technology startups

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:24.815Z)

you know, people are starting

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:26.271Z)

you know, people are starting them all the time versus, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:27.305Z)

all the time versus you know, your private equity fund.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:30.371Z)

you know, if you're a private equity fund,

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:31.195Z)

That's not something you're doing.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:32.361Z)

that's not something you're doing. People are starting up out of their

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:33.245Z)

People started either. You know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:35.921Z)

you know, like, all the time. Right? It's not quite as, quick and dirty. We're seeing, like, a big real estate company. So I think maybe that's why LLCs are particularly prevalent in the technology space.

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:44.815Z)

But we are, like, Michael original

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:45.521Z)

But we are like, my company, we're an like, we I was a

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:47.165Z)

like, we I was just individual

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:49.111Z)

individual LLC initially, and then when we

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:50.725Z)

restructure

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:51.341Z)

we restructured,

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:52.415Z)

as joint venture.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:53.141Z)

as a joint venture, we're still a multi member LLC.

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:53.555Z)

For some based on California.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:56.471Z)

Based out of California.

### You (2025-06-23T19:07:57.405Z)

You know? And I think eventually protect

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:07:58.731Z)

You know, And I think eventually for taxation purposes, we may file as an s corp.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:00.235Z)

versus we think file a password. So still need an LLC.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:03.551Z)

But we would still be an LLC.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:04.075Z)

Yeah. So I

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:05.601Z)

So

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:05.825Z)

you

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:06.271Z)

I don't think there's any reason to go with the corporation route

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:07.105Z)

corporation. Right? Right?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:10.271Z)

You know, whatever the benefits are, I think they're outweighed by the complexities and challenges.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:11.215Z)

They're out with of challenges. And cost. And I think

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:14.981Z)

And costs. And I think even just in today's world, like, hell,

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:16.005Z)

you know, just the would like to help. Pretty

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:19.041Z)

LLC is pretty widely accepted even for investment and acquisition purposes.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:22.665Z)

So I would think there's any

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:23.851Z)

So I don't think there's any I think we could we should just go the LLC multi member LLC based in Georgia.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:28.775Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:33.011Z)

Mark, what did you guys do at Pinktata? Nope. You're on mute, Mark.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:35.875Z)

Nope. You're out. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:43.101Z)

I mean, pretty much everything I've ever been involved with has been a Delaware based LLC. You know, not just for technology, but for real estate investing as well. It just seems to be the

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:50.355Z)

It just seems to be the standard

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:52.731Z)

the standard.

### You (2025-06-23T19:08:53.675Z)

But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:08:53.831Z)

But Pinktata was an LLC, to answer your question specifically.

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:05.375Z)

Delaware seems to be the standard for all businesses, and and this is my experience.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:09.331Z)

all businesses and at least in my experience.

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:12.325Z)

K. What would you know what the exactly why, but I just know that that that seems to be

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:26.385Z)

I think it's kind of why

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:26.921Z)

most favorable. I think it's kinda why

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:28.125Z)

Delaware exists.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:29.441Z)

Delaware exists. You know, they're the, that's their thing.

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:30.525Z)

The the thing. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Definitely, the most

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:32.641Z)

Right. Yeah. Yeah. I know it's definitely, like, the the most favorable

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:34.685Z)

That's a joke.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:36.521Z)

was a joke. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. The LLCs any LLCs and Joe Biden Yeah. Exactly. I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with don't mean to get too political, but I'll stick with LLCs. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:50.235Z)

Okay. Well, saw definitely a multi member LLC, so that was gonna go to the question if whether it's still American or

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:09:51.871Z)

Alright. Well and so it sounds like definitely a multi member LLC is the route we wanna go. The question is whether it's Delaware or Georgia. Well, let me start with Delaware. Just

### You (2025-06-23T19:09:58.345Z)

Well, let me start with Delaware just because does it. And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:01.681Z)

because everyone does it. And so let me

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:02.295Z)

so let me I I just the research on the corporation, but I think the LLC is very

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:04.701Z)

I I did the research on the corporation, but I think the LLC is very similar.

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:07.255Z)

similar. So let me just start there.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:09.491Z)

Let me just start there, and then,

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:09.705Z)

And then then I'll I'll

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:12.591Z)

then I'll I'll and I don't other than just

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:12.835Z)

those and I don't other than everyone does it. I guess, following the the leader, but what we start there, and then I'll

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:16.721Z)

everyone does it, I guess, following the leader. But why don't we start there, and then I'll

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:20.195Z)

I'll see what I can accomplish

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:21.691Z)

I'll see what I can accomplish. I I I hate to take two days.

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:22.045Z)

I I I guess. Hate to continue but according to Chad, GP

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:25.171Z)

I hate to confuse things, but according to chat GBT,

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:27.115Z)

for Texas startups, the c corp is generally considered best

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:28.581Z)

for tech startups, the c corp is generally considered the best legal structure.

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:30.755Z)

legal structure for its ability to attract

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:33.101Z)

For its ability to attract

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:33.245Z)

investment and facilitate rapid growth.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:34.721Z)

investment and facilitate rapid growth.

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:35.535Z)

Anyway,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:36.871Z)

Anyway, that's ChatGPT's spin on things. We we can always like, we can always restructure Like, it's very easy to do. To go from LLC to c corp or s corp, I think it's harder

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:37.735Z)

that's chatty. We spit on things. We can always reach like, we can always restructure, but it's very easy to the deep the deep core. I think it's harder to core.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:10:49.311Z)

or if not impossible to go the other way.

### You (2025-06-23T19:10:50.775Z)

Yeah. No. That that I know you're you're correct about that. That if you start off as an LLC, there's nothing that prohibits you from changing. But I think there are some some hurdles that have to be addressed if you're going the other way around.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:07.251Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:08.635Z)

Yeah. So start with it. It's it's an investor or

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:10.541Z)

So let me just start with this. If if an investor or customer, whatever,

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:12.395Z)

customer, whatever. Says that they, you know, want us to be an

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:15.151Z)

says that they you know, want us to be an l you know, a a c corp or an s corp, then we can

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:16.465Z)

you know, a a c corporate or something. We can go ahead and do that. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:20.651Z)

can go ahead and do that. Okay. Got it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:23.615Z)

Got it. So I on that this week.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:25.861Z)

So I will work on that this week.

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:28.875Z)

Sorry. It's loud and here.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:31.121Z)

Sorry. It's loud in here.

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:32.065Z)

Howard, you also have the trademark in there. What what do we why do we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:32.861Z)

Howard, you also have the trademark in there. What what are we

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:35.805Z)

talking about

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:36.481Z)

well, I know we're talking about

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:37.075Z)

like, trying to kick around

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:38.891Z)

like, we've been trying to kick around patent ideas.

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:39.605Z)

patent ideas But what are we trademarking the logo or

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:42.411Z)

But what are we trademarking the logo? Are

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:44.925Z)

we trademark what are trademarking?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:11:46.511Z)

we trademarking what are we trademarking?

### You (2025-06-23T19:11:47.615Z)

A trademark and a copyright are similar but a trademark gives you a lot more legal defense. So you know, Coca Cola, their label, Pepsi. I mean, everybody you get a trademark on on that. That basically says nobody else can use InnVestAI or our our logo. You know, you can't patent a name but, a copyright also does give you some protection for product names So, you know, we may have different types of or different levels. Right? We may have evaluation model, which is our core. And then maybe we may wanna start adding on some other features Then we come up with a name for them those can be copyrighted. There's not as much of a legal protection with a copyright. But you it it will you in your particular space. So if we were to get a if we were to come up with a a name for the valuation model, that you know, maybe it's the InnVest whatever. A copy right will protect anybody else or protect us from anybody else in commercial real estate who comes up with a specific model. But if there's an entirely other industry that's unrelated and somebody uses the word invest whatever, that typically can be used outside. So, it's a little bit different.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:13:29.091Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-23T19:13:30.225Z)

So with with Red EyeQ Okay. If you take a look at the Red IQ website, we had valuation IQ. We had, you know, the the RedIQ core and and QuickSync. You know, things like ValuationIQ and QuickSync as product names were copyrighted. And so you can go from there. But you can't patent a name. And trademarks are usually specific to logos or something a a design that designates a particular company.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:01.431Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:01.875Z)

Right? So Got it. So I'll go through that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:06.051Z)

So I'll go the route of

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:06.775Z)

copyrights, researching that and trying to figure that out.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:08.431Z)

copyrights, researching that and trying to figure that out.

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:09.785Z)

But on the trademark itself,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:11.381Z)

But on the trademark itself, I mean, we love what

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:11.995Z)

mean, we bought what we've done so far, but when we actually

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:14.791Z)

done so far, but when we actually have funding,

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:15.415Z)

have funding, maybe we wanna keep it open

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:18.001Z)

maybe we wanna keep it open to, like, you know,

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:18.385Z)

to, like, you know, further playing around with

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:21.491Z)

further playing around with the actual logo. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:21.595Z)

the actual logo. Right? Yeah. So trademark for now, but

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:25.171Z)

So we'll just leave the trademark for now, but go the copy

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:26.365Z)

go to copy. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:29.021Z)

right.

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:29.335Z)

Route. But but but is there is there some kind of

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:30.981Z)

Route. But but is there is there some kind of process

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:32.125Z)

process

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:34.691Z)

protection we could get? Because, again, our our logo is nice, but

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:36.085Z)

but I don't think that's really investors are going to value us. Right? The fact that we're combining

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:38.161Z)

I don't think that's really where investors are going to value us. Right? The the fact that we're combining

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:41.135Z)

you know, the this great analytical tool with AI,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:43.201Z)

you know, this great analytical tool with AI, with the ability to

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:44.735Z)

with the ability to you know, save information and disseminate it to all parties. Yeah. You know, like, the the whole process

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:47.841Z)

save information and disseminate it to all parties. You know, like, that that whole process

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:51.265Z)

I think that's where the real Yeah. I I think a trade yeah. A trademark is not going to give us any value.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:14:53.321Z)

that's where the real sort of secret sauce is.

### You (2025-06-23T19:14:57.835Z)

It's just going to pre protect us and our identity. From any potential competitors. And they're they're they're relatively inexpensive. A copyright's $250. If you want to have somebody else help you with it, it's $350. A trademark, I it is gonna be a little bit more than that, but, you know, we're not talking about thousands of dollars like we are for incorporation. But, yeah, Mark, what you're what you're talking about, the actual tools that we develop, those are the ones that we have to be protective of. But if we the thing that I learned is a logo is able to trademark. And if that logo is attached to the tools, know, for example, if every one of our web pages in our tools has our logo on it, that trademark applies to whatever whatever it's attached to. Right? So there it it it yeah. It's not gonna it's not gonna make us money. But it's gonna protect our identity in the market. Basically, is how that works. And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:06.201Z)

Yeah. And the the challenge yeah. Patenting

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:07.725Z)

the challenge yet, how do you think Mark, you know, just what you're you're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:11.061Z)

with Margo, which is what you're you're

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:12.285Z)

you want it. Is challenging because

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:13.501Z)

you wanted is challenging because, I mean, a, you have to

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:14.605Z)

mean, a, you have to put document every single

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:17.431Z)

put document every single thing you're doing

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:18.325Z)

you're doing, Like, you have to document the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:20.951Z)

Like, we'd have to document the

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:22.135Z)

behind our

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:23.061Z)

logic behind our

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:23.755Z)

underwriting. That the document

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:25.551Z)

underwriting. We have to you know,

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:25.955Z)

I know how he knows

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:27.481Z)

I don't know how detailed it needs to get, but, you know, potentially, it's down down to the, you know,

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:27.595Z)

need to get, but, you know, potentially, it's down. Down to the, you know, mode. That we are using

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:32.301Z)

computer code.

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:32.885Z)

And you know, we have

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:33.471Z)

We are using, and, you know, we'd have to say that this is unique to us.

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:33.995Z)

to fit. The business You need to which might know, buy some years.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:37.641Z)

Which might, you know, buy us some years

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:38.585Z)

I think they got approved. As something

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:40.401Z)

if it got approved.

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:41.735Z)

actionable.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:42.051Z)

As something patentable.

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:42.335Z)

That it would buy some cancer protection, but then it would have

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:44.121Z)

It would buy us some years of protection. But then when that is done,

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:45.655Z)

done. That patent goes away, and anybody else can replicate it

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:47.841Z)

that patent goes away and anybody else can replicate it

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:49.175Z)

without any issue. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:50.811Z)

without any issue. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:51.345Z)

But this is computer

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:52.371Z)

Versus

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:53.375Z)

post in the lobby behind it

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:54.011Z)

computer code and the logic behind it

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:55.055Z)

is is. Some extent,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:56.731Z)

is is, to some extent, discrete. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:56.905Z)

it's free. Right? Like, users don't see that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:16:59.591Z)

users don't see that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:16:59.645Z)

and therefore, cannot we can try to reverse engineer it to think of

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:01.441Z)

And therefore cannot I mean, they can try to reverse engineer it, but they don't get

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:04.135Z)

get that you can't just see it right there. Right? So it looks like Coca is not added

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:06.071Z)

that you can't just see it right there. Right? Similar to, like, Coca Cola,

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:09.455Z)

Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:09.611Z)

which is not patented.

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:10.585Z)

can try to put a percentage here by looking at the ingredients, but

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:11.191Z)

Right? Like, you could try to reverse engineer it by looking at the ingredients on the can, but

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:14.245Z)

you can't.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:15.621Z)

you you can't necessarily replicate it because that is not

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:15.645Z)

He's not.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:18.431Z)

claimed anywhere. And I think, you know, the the challenge we were going up against trying to patent

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:22.625Z)

Which I think

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:24.261Z)

which I think I think Android and Apple ran into the same issue is that one of them tried to

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:26.605Z)

same issue that one of them tried to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:30.211Z)

patent the idea of, like, a touch screen

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:31.035Z)

that's why with user finger

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:32.741Z)

that slides when you use your finger,

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:33.185Z)

can the whatever cord it was that's like that's not

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:34.911Z)

and the the whatever cord it was said, like, that's not the ball because it's not like, something you did that's, like, a unique

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:41.655Z)

you eat. Intellectual property creation. That's just, like, a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:44.081Z)

intellectual property creation. That's just like a

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:45.155Z)

stick to people do. It's just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:46.831Z)

thing that people do. It's just like it was too general, basically.

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:48.555Z)

too difficult. And I think what we're talking about

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:51.801Z)

I think what we're talking about

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:51.975Z)

at 12 know, we might

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:53.611Z)

at some point, you know, we might

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:54.475Z)

do something you know, right, with each other, something that is

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:56.141Z)

do something, you know, right, with the use of AI or something that is

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:57.575Z)

very unique and very possible.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:17:59.201Z)

very unique and very patentable.

### You (2025-06-23T19:17:59.965Z)

But what would right now is not in sync.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:01.551Z)

What we're doing right now is

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:03.035Z)

It's not a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:03.231Z)

not it is unique in the sense that it's online, but the underlying functionality and

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:07.685Z)

It's just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:07.991Z)

way that it's done is

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:08.985Z)

same way that we have done it. So I'm not sure we can say that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:09.411Z)

is just the same way that everybody else does it. So I'm not sure we could say that it's That's my and it's my take on based on what I've

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:16.025Z)

might take a bit too much. You know, my conversation so far with

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:19.211Z)

you know, my conversations so far with with attorneys on my own products.

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:19.865Z)

with internal problems. Okay. So just to conclude,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:29.211Z)

Okay. So just to conclude,

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:29.705Z)

we I'm gonna work on

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:31.511Z)

we I'm gonna work on copyright

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:32.135Z)

copyright this week. Gonna put the pause on trademark because the trademark's around the logo.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:34.841Z)

this week We're gonna put the pause on trademark because the trademarks are around the logo.

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:38.385Z)

The logo, there's a little bit of a chance

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:39.871Z)

In the logo, there's a little bit of a chance the logo could change.

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:40.395Z)

the logo could change. And happening is still in our mind.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:43.661Z)

And then patenting is still in our mind because

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:44.375Z)

Because right, it's a good idea if

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:46.711Z)

Mark is right. It's a good idea if if, like, we can have some sort of

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:47.565Z)

if, like, we can have some sort of patent pending. But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:50.691Z)

patent pending

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:51.405Z)

be easy. For a while.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:52.081Z)

it might not be for a while yet until we're able to

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:52.895Z)

Yet until we're able to get down a process that is true.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:18:56.961Z)

get down a process that is truly unique to hospitality and might

### You (2025-06-23T19:18:59.175Z)

Hospitality

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:02.381Z)

right right, Drew, might have something some secret sauce that other under just

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:02.495Z)

So, Tigers that other underworld doesn't have.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:06.511Z)

regular underwriting doesn't have.

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:08.075Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:08.821Z)

Yeah. And, again, I think at some point, we we

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:11.695Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:12.531Z)

may or or hopefully will create something that's more more unique

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:17.215Z)

To us.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:19.231Z)

to us.

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:19.325Z)

Then even then I feel that much for me to have to think, like, when you create

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:20.791Z)

And then even then, I would still say, I'm not sure if we need a patent. I think, like, when you create some kind of

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:22.865Z)

some kind of can you

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:25.441Z)

algorithm, computer code, logic,

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:25.725Z)

custom logic, way of doing things. That's specific each. You know, it's like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:28.761Z)

way of doing things that's really unique.

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:30.815Z)

if we create something that explodes

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:31.291Z)

You know, it's like, if we created, like, something like flow through. Right? But, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:32.415Z)

through. Right? But, like, this is type of flow through. It's like a really easy calculation.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:35.481Z)

the next type of flow through, it's like a really unique calculation.

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:40.135Z)

Calculations.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:40.261Z)

I mean, you could patent it or you could just say you just don't you just do the calculation, put it on the page and

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:46.575Z)

Helpful to you?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:47.471Z)

say, like, look. This is helpful to you. Use it, but I'm not necessarily gonna tell you every step of how I got What about if I you know, Diane this morning sent out that email about you know, the the time consuming process of just organizing all the data and then sending it

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:56.815Z)

All the data. And send it 25 different people. It

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:19:59.941Z)

to 25 different people. If if we came up with a clever brand or name for that

### You (2025-06-23T19:19:59.995Z)

if we came up with the clever brand for him for that process, and then we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:04.911Z)

process,

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:05.115Z)

filed some kind of copyright

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:06.301Z)

and then we filed some kind of

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:07.545Z)

we said, you know, if we're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:08.291Z)

copyright, and we said, you know, we if we called it, like, you know,

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:08.705Z)

don't of them, like you know, information secure something

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:11.671Z)

information secure or, you know, something, you know that's obviously not a very clever name, but

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:11.835Z)

you know, obviously not a good day. But and then we just sort of took define what information hotel

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:16.221Z)

and then we just sort of define what information hotel information

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:17.605Z)

information. Store

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:20.451Z)

store was.

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:20.505Z)

Right? It's just process of storing

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:22.221Z)

Right? And just the process of storing every piece of data relating to hotel acquisition

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:22.925Z)

every piece of data. Related. To tell. Acquisition. So disseminated acquisition. So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:27.191Z)

so it could be easily disseminated to, you know, dozens of third party consultants

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:27.595Z)

to you know, up party. It's all that could lead pat

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:32.781Z)

Like, could we

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:33.425Z)

down. Process

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:34.291Z)

patent that process I mean, yeah. Again marketplace. Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:37.665Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:40.321Z)

I mean, right? And, well, do you guys have have you do you guys know what VTS marketplace

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:41.025Z)

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:45.595Z)

literally. Market.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:46.081Z)

I've seen VTS. I'm not familiar with the marketplace, but I know, you know, I know VTS, and I've

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:47.125Z)

You know, know what we get. With them all. But you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:50.671Z)

interacted with it a little bit. But

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:52.335Z)

is just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:52.371Z)

Because, I mean, what Diane outlined this morning is just it just happens on every deal, and it happens to

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:52.695Z)

it it just happens on every you know, just that such a it was such a huge

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:57.131Z)

know, it just it's such a

### You (2025-06-23T19:20:58.095Z)

innovation. Just that we can sort

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:20:59.061Z)

be such a huge innovation

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:00.135Z)

market that. Process.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:00.991Z)

if we can sort of market that process.

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:02.925Z)

Is the best way to know if no one has

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:03.881Z)

Because to the best of my knowledge, no one has done that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:04.435Z)

done that. Yeah. I think it's certainly

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:07.521Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:07.635Z)

something we can like.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:08.491Z)

I think it's certainly something we can like, you know, when the time comes, we can

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:08.855Z)

You know, when the time comes, we can we can evaluate it. Right? When we can look at it,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:12.901Z)

we can evaluate it. Right? Or we can look at it and and talk with an attorney. I mean, we can use

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:13.945Z)

and talk with attorney

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:17.871Z)

I mean, I have an attorney that I use that's that's been really, really great on all of this stuff. We can use my attorney or talk to my attorney, or we can use you

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:23.145Z)

or we can use

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:26.401Z)

one for our you know, designated for our because I just I mean, just fast forwarding ahead, I know that when we start meeting with

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:29.095Z)

investors. Top

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:31.371Z)

investors,

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:31.395Z)

five questions that we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:32.131Z)

one of the top five questions they're gonna ask is, you know, how proprietary is what you're doing and

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:32.365Z)

ask is, you know, have a Friday service. What you're doing. You know, protections do you have for it? And so it's sort of a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:37.321Z)

what protections do you have. Right? That that's always sort of a

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:38.515Z)

top five question. So if we could just start thinking

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:40.611Z)

top five question. So

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:41.665Z)

about this now, I think it'll

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:42.621Z)

could just start thinking about this now, I think it'll just

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:42.895Z)

just put us in a better position.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:45.141Z)

put us in a better position to ultimately

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:45.205Z)

To help. Ultimately fund rates. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:48.001Z)

fundraise. Yeah. I was just out of curiosity. I was looking

### You (2025-06-23T19:21:52.205Z)

I'm co star

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:21:53.791Z)

to see if CoStar has patents and, it seems like they do. And then it looks like it says, like, they are related to the systems and methods for commercial real estate,

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:07.155Z)

But we're certainly

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:09.711Z)

associating aerial images with map features and information.

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:10.045Z)

map features the information. Is that one of them. I don't know if they're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:14.061Z)

At least that's one of them.

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:15.325Z)

have proper data. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:16.501Z)

Know if they have anything about their data. Know. Yeah. And so I guess we can look

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:17.075Z)

So I guess we can put should look into it. More.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:20.541Z)

should look into it more.

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:21.485Z)

I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:22.131Z)

I mean, maybe we

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:22.705Z)

just having a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:25.161Z)

just have to just talk to an attorney. I mean, Diane Mark, have you guys talked to an attorney about

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:25.395Z)

Just talk to an attorney and get that. Can you get talk to an attorney as well? I think you have talked to an attorney so far about that thing.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:31.991Z)

I think you said you have talked to an attorney so far about patenting?

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:32.775Z)

I did.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:34.741Z)

I did. The

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:34.765Z)

Research on who some of the top attorneys are in, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:36.931Z)

research on who some of the top attorneys are and, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:38.675Z)

in patenting So I but it was just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:40.871Z)

in patenting.

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:41.605Z)

a generic search.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:42.281Z)

So, I mean but it was just a generic search.

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:44.095Z)

But wonder if

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:46.191Z)

But I wonder if

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:47.615Z)

Drew, are you like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:49.711Z)

Drew, are you in front of, like, ChatGPT or

### You (2025-06-23T19:22:50.225Z)

GT or an AI system? Just to see if the market place. Patented. I'm just curious. They are.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:22:53.271Z)

an AI system that you just just to see. Yeah. VTS marketplace is is, patented. I'm just curious if they are.

### You (2025-06-23T19:23:00.195Z)

Is this a similar cost

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:23:02.201Z)

Is this a similar concept?

### You (2025-06-23T19:23:05.075Z)

It's like they are, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:23:07.111Z)

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:02.601Z)

I mean, I think

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:04.735Z)

have to bear

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:05.231Z)

with a patent, you would have to very clearly

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:06.115Z)

articulate and document what

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:08.621Z)

articulate and document

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:08.835Z)

it is we are

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:10.501Z)

what it is we are patenting, basically. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:13.175Z)

Right? Like, the Coca Cola the recipe for Coca Cola. Know, that's your

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:15.951Z)

with Coca Cola, it's the recipe for Coca Cola. Your. That's your

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:18.455Z)

that would be your ad.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:20.441Z)

would be your patent. I mean, they don't have it patented, but that that would be it. Right? For us, it's like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:22.035Z)

It's like, what is the recipe exactly that we are saying?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:24.641Z)

what is the recipe exactly that we are saying is unique to us that no one else can copy?

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:25.555Z)

You need us to know how to stop which and I I I I mean, that's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:29.631Z)

Which and I don't I don't I I mean, that

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:30.525Z)

we probably have to get from we'd obviously have to get in a hurry to tell us.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:32.601Z)

we probably have to get I mean, we'd obviously have to get an attorney to tell us

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:34.055Z)

You know, help us figure out and document what that is.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:36.061Z)

you know, help us figure out and document what that is.

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:38.715Z)

Yeah. To the person specific process in the way it's not

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:40.681Z)

Because I'm sure it's a very specific process in way of documenting it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:43.445Z)

So we'd actually

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:45.821Z)

So Which actually makes leads me

### You (2025-06-23T19:26:47.265Z)

makes the least start ins that we have to well, I know this isn't my place

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:26:50.561Z)

through into that we have to, well, I know this isn't my plea, but the budget

### You (2025-06-23T19:27:28.145Z)

### You (2025-06-23T19:27:33.175Z)

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:27:43.791Z)

So, Howard, probably we can sit on that tomorrow if possible.

### You (2025-06-23T19:27:45.455Z)

Yeah. You know, we've you and I have got that spreadsheet that I had some information on. Dig that up In some way, I'm trying to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:27:56.971Z)

In some ways, I'm trying to back

### You (2025-06-23T19:27:58.185Z)

back into, like, what does $2,000,000,000 get you?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:00.621Z)

into, like, what does $2,000,000 get you?

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:01.825Z)

Because I just hear that two playing it like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:03.941Z)

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:04.605Z)

over and over and over and over again. What I read about startups.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:08.641Z)

read about startups.

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:09.195Z)

And then you you'll know that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:10.651Z)

And and then, Mark, you you'll know this better than I do, but I've also read

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:10.905Z)

better than I do. But also steps for that 2,000,000 generally give up 1015% of the owner

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:15.431Z)

that for that 2,000,000, you generally give up 10 to 15%.

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:18.755Z)

of the company

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:19.591Z)

$5,000,000.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:31.411Z)

the idea you have is worth $5,000,000.

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:31.825Z)

And you're making $2,000,000 in exchange for 20 So is that, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:34.031Z)

And you're getting $2,000,000 in exchange for 20 Was that, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:42.231Z)

You know, that percentage of 5,000,000?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:47.381Z)

you know, that percentage of of 5,000,000.

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:48.495Z)

I'm just asking

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:50.801Z)

I mean, that

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:51.205Z)

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:53.011Z)

that

### You (2025-06-23T19:28:53.345Z)

Company was started out.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:28:53.471Z)

that I did have a lot of conversations with companies like Starwood I had the private equity arm, Highgate Tech. Right? I talked to a lot of them, and they were all, like, none of them was willing to give me a 5,000,000 valuation. They're like, we like what you're doing, but tell us when you have you know come to us when we have at least a million in ARR, and then we'll talk

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:09.735Z)

About you know, current value

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:12.161Z)

about know, current value and future prospects. But until you have that, there's nothing to talk about.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:14.425Z)

something to help out.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:17.561Z)

Unless you wanna sell your whole company for, like, really, you know, give you, bucks. That was not interesting.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:21.615Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:23.331Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:23.575Z)

but I I don't feel that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:23.971Z)

So I think but it also depends on I mean, like, they look at I think they look at the pool of people you're working with.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:31.295Z)

Me.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:31.371Z)

Right? They look at and and for me, it was just me. It's not a very credible pool of of talent to pull from with the with the five of us. You know, Mark, you have

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:35.145Z)

With the platform. Know, hard to have start start iOS sort of now. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:39.841Z)

background in start startups. I have my startup now.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:41.755Z)

Credibility to go to a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:42.861Z)

Right? It gives us any more credibility to go to a potential investor. Be like, look. This idea of working on is worth 5,000,000.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:42.995Z)

central metric. Look, this idea for, you know, the first $5,000,000, You just have to take our words for it. Just understand.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:47.831Z)

Bucks. You just have to take our word for it to some extent.

### You (2025-06-23T19:29:52.235Z)

So sorry. I thought you had a funny another right

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:29:54.411Z)

So sorry. I thought you also used me I'm right

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:05.275Z)

I'll do something here.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:07.441Z)

I'll just jump in here.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:08.075Z)

One do the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:09.831Z)

With one other thing. That is when I was doing the research,

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:10.285Z)

research, I have seen $10,000,000

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:13.211Z)

I kept seeing also, like, $10,000,000 free money valuation

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:14.865Z)

money value creation. Like, 2,000,000

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:18.951Z)

Like, 2,000,000 then add a $10,000,000 pre money valuation equals 10 to

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:20.245Z)

ten million dollars pre money evaluation equals 1015% of your company. So it just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:25.321Z)

15% of your company.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:26.725Z)

take that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:27.311Z)

So it just it it was such a random thing that I ran

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:27.355Z)

Such a that I ran I mean, that I cross it over

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:31.231Z)

I mean, that I would run across it over and over and over again.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:31.435Z)

over and over. Again. It's It felt like it was just a real sum or something like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:35.151Z)

Felt like maybe it was just a rule of thumb or something like

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:36.045Z)

that that You were right. Directly to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:38.151Z)

that that Yeah. A lot of that is gonna be tied directly to to our projections.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:38.655Z)

to our projections and our addressable market. And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:42.411Z)

And our addressable market.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:42.895Z)

you know, basically, the feedback that we get

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:44.151Z)

And, you know, basically, the feedback that we get from our initial testers.

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:44.435Z)

from our additional testers. So Right. You know, typically, that first that five years projections

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:47.901Z)

So Right. Typically, that those that first that five years of projections and sort of

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:50.235Z)

sort of I would can show you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:53.001Z)

how we can show

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:53.715Z)

track that projection as

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:54.941Z)

you know, our plan to track that projection is is really what's gonna be used to

### You (2025-06-23T19:30:55.075Z)

this really what's gonna be. Be used to kind of set that initial value. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:30:58.861Z)

kind of set that initial evaluation. Right.

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:01.065Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:06.601Z)

The evaluations I mean, it it would be done like a hotel

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:07.405Z)

English. Right? I mean, there.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:09.581Z)

valuation. Right? I mean, just they're looking for a 40% IRR

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:10.125Z)

Percent IRR. On it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:13.521Z)

on it. Yeah. I don't know if if the at it necessarily that way. I just think they wanna try to try to gauge kind of how we think

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:22.015Z)

Going. To grow. With that now.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:23.331Z)

the market is going to grow and now, you know, what our capture rate is and what the market size is.

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:23.435Z)

Rate or something like the market size is. So there's just a fair amount of guesswork.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:29.461Z)

I think there is just a fair amount of guesswork.

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:30.395Z)

You know, terms direct interest. Projection.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:32.741Z)

You know, in in terms of right. Because these are just projections, so there's really no

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:33.145Z)

So it's really no no historic cash. Flow. Benchmark.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:36.601Z)

historic cash flow to benchmark.

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:36.735Z)

So I You know, again, we'll get

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:39.461Z)

So,

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:39.465Z)

at at also market size,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:40.461Z)

they can just look at and then also market size and who our competitors are and

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:40.955Z)

work. There's a lot of different can think that the plate to this.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:44.471Z)

there's a lot of different things that that play into this.

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:44.545Z)

But from what I think my experience as far as

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:48.101Z)

From what I've

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:49.295Z)

it's I was looking

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:50.011Z)

my experience so far is no one's looking for a 40%. It's nothing like hotel and real estate

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:50.345Z)

for 40%. Nothing like hotel and real estate value valuation. Hotels hotel and real

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:54.921Z)

valuations. Hotels are

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:56.815Z)

equivalent to, like, buying a bond.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:31:57.241Z)

hotel and real estate are equivalent to, like, buying a bond,

### You (2025-06-23T19:31:58.455Z)

Right? But to be stable cash flow.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:00.681Z)

Right? It's supposed to be stable cash flow.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:00.715Z)

Which I'll observe. Something like that because they have

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:03.011Z)

Hotels are somewhat of an exception because they aren't

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:03.455Z)

you know, more like, a or a little bit. They like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:05.841Z)

you know, more unstable or volatile than, say, like, offices or multifamily.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:06.285Z)

offices or home

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:10.531Z)

But but, essentially, people people buy real estate for state for stability

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:13.935Z)

like, investment.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:14.281Z)

you know, as a conservative bond like investment, bond like return.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:14.855Z)

Bond, like return. With your with your interest.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:19.101Z)

When you're when you're investing in a start up, particularly a technology startup, people are not going there for stability.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:23.175Z)

They're not both there for too much three.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:26.161Z)

They're not going there for 20 or 30, 40% IRR. They're going there for 10,000 IRR.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:27.205Z)

Higher.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:30.901Z)

They're going there to find the next unicorn. They're looking to give you $2,000,000 now in exchange for a $100,000,000 in five years.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:35.645Z)

Just like a loop thing. To go

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:37.921Z)

I mean, is just, like, a ludicrous

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:38.435Z)

looking for. Like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:40.381Z)

thing to go in looking for.

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:40.575Z)

things absolutely. Like this.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:42.511Z)

It just, like, seems

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:43.415Z)

Me.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:44.081Z)

absolutely, like, just stupid to me. But

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:44.255Z)

That could be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:47.191Z)

that's basically what it seems like people are really looking for. So

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:51.205Z)

like, what

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:51.391Z)

they look at the number of things people are gonna look at is, like, what's the TAM of your

### You (2025-06-23T19:32:54.675Z)

In our case? How how

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:32:56.421Z)

market? Right? In our case, how many how many companies out there invest in

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:01.485Z)

me

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:33:02.431Z)

or involved in hotel transaction? 100?

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:04.665Z)

of that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:33:05.281Z)

A thousand, 10,000,

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:06.605Z)

it might be worth.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:33:07.031Z)

know, and what percentage of them do you think you can get? And how much will they pay for it? Like

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:12.195Z)

Number.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:33:12.641Z)

that's and then how long will they get to your market capture rate of 5% or whatever?

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:13.915Z)

Sorry? Understand that's like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:33:17.521Z)

So I understand that's the typical, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:33:18.915Z)

But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:31.721Z)

I I know. I mean, I know I'm being maybe overly hopeful, but

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:35.265Z)

officer. And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:35.831Z)

Therese Rose. She's the chief operating officer.

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:38.365Z)

about that. She on the senior side for a long

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:42.981Z)

And I I'm a little hopeful about that is she

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:43.845Z)

time. She was on the, like, the on the office side, and moved over into hotels. So she understands the company really well.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:47.511Z)

has been on the CBRE side for a long time. She was in the, like, on the on the office

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:52.525Z)

So anyway, she

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:53.141Z)

side and moved over into hotels.

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:53.925Z)

like, she made it a point with

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:55.551Z)

So she understands the company really well.

### You (2025-06-23T19:35:56.025Z)

me to say the data integrity was an issue for them right now and then trying to figure out a way to solve it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:35:59.481Z)

Anyway, she like, she made it a point with me to say the data integrity was an issue for them right now.

### You (2025-06-23T19:36:02.845Z)

So I never talked to to her, but maybe

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:36:06.541Z)

And they're trying to figure out a way to solve it. So I mean, maybe

### You (2025-06-23T19:36:09.125Z)

maybe even if you because only interview her. Can

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:36:11.651Z)

I said, I've tried I've never talked to to her, but maybe maybe if you Anyway this is only interview, I could chat again because that that would be a huge I mean and, again, they were I think, the issue

### You (2025-06-23T19:36:21.255Z)

eat for stuff. Like, think.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:36:24.261Z)

That might be interested

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:36:35.981Z)

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:36:51.181Z)

pitch for them.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:39.661Z)

Drew, maybe also just because she was she was

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:40.485Z)

And if you're concerned, about data integrity,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:43.301Z)

like, giving me bread crumbs. Right? She was, like, trying to lead me.

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:44.375Z)

you need a validation method. Right? Like, you need

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:47.041Z)

To the right pitch for them.

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:47.505Z)

way to be able to find

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:49.081Z)

And

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:49.715Z)

the outlet

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:50.211Z)

if you're concerned about data integrity, you need

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:50.425Z)

kick them out, kick them back, So I don't know.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:53.791Z)

a validation method. Right? Like, you need a way

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:55.005Z)

If we should be about that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:37:56.841Z)

to be able to find the outliers and kick them out and kick them back.

### You (2025-06-23T19:37:57.405Z)

Part of our pitch too. Assuming we're talking to the concern,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:01.001Z)

So

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:01.975Z)

about

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:02.441Z)

I don't know if we should be thinking about

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:02.535Z)

data. Category. Like, what is our value

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:05.461Z)

that as part of our pitch too.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:05.465Z)

and process on the data? Does that make

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:07.501Z)

Especially when we're talking to bigger firms.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:08.295Z)

sense? Yeah. Yeah. That does.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:10.581Z)

About data integrity, like, is our validation process

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:12.295Z)

Yeah. I don't know how it works.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:14.561Z)

on the data? Does that make sense?

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:16.425Z)

One way it would be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:17.731Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That does

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:17.915Z)

That's the way.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:20.251Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:21.435Z)

Content and sources. Right? So one source is true and probably we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:22.671Z)

I don't know how one way would be

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:26.215Z)

also have other sources. Or some other API is where

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:26.891Z)

to validate the data from

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:30.165Z)

we can compare the data and

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:30.301Z)

different sources. Right? So one source is

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:32.285Z)

you know, validate.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:33.561Z)

true, and probably we also have other sources say, CoistAI or some other API.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:35.205Z)

Or another way would be the documents that are uploaded by the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:38.441Z)

Wherein we can compare the data and, you know, validate

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:41.295Z)

platform?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:43.871Z)

Or another way would be the documents

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:44.805Z)

Something like that. We can kind of add these data links created

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:47.961Z)

that are uploaded by the user directly to our platform.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:49.915Z)

and what's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:51.331Z)

Something like that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:51.335Z)

a validation is completed, then know, the final data goes into our

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:55.101Z)

We can kind of have these

### You (2025-06-23T19:38:55.545Z)

data warehouse warehouse.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:38:57.051Z)

data lakes created. And once our validation is completed, then, you know, the final data goes into our data warehouse, where, you know, we

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:08.045Z)

Data from the production level application.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:08.161Z)

use the data from the data warehouse into the application or reports or

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:11.215Z)

Did you guys have to do that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:14.011Z)

you know, we are using

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:14.955Z)

for IQ? Did you have that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:15.891Z)

the data for the production level application.

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:16.855Z)

like, a data valid like, an

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:19.821Z)

Did you guys have to do that

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:19.915Z)

serious data validation process?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:23.501Z)

for Red IQ? Did you have a a like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:25.875Z)

Team, but they are working on

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:26.521Z)

a data valid, like, a really

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:28.645Z)

create

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:28.701Z)

serious data validation process.

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:30.025Z)

platinum data, which is again, our

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:32.431Z)

I mean, we did have a data dedicated data team, but they are working on

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:32.595Z)

data warehouse. Which go through different, you know, process.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:37.371Z)

creating

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:38.705Z)

But for an IT, I don't think we have dedicated.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:38.751Z)

platinum data, which is, again, a data warehouse

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:42.015Z)

And there are team working on

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:43.271Z)

which goes through different, you know, ETL process.

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:43.935Z)

that. We have certain logic application

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:47.311Z)

But for Red IQ, I don't think we had dedicated.

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:47.825Z)

and then does it return on the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:50.651Z)

Data team working on

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:50.835Z)

different parts, like, it's tool process, and all that. But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:52.641Z)

that. We had certain logic that in the application

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:54.835Z)

the note Right. With the air thing,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:56.781Z)

and then logic within on

### You (2025-06-23T19:39:57.185Z)

because it started up acquired and they never had a data thing

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:39:59.381Z)

different parts like stored processors and all that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:01.285Z)

And I don't think even for Katie, I

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:02.501Z)

But they're not dedicated their team.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:05.225Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:05.521Z)

Because it was a startup acquired and they never had a data team.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:07.325Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:09.861Z)

And I don't think even Arcadia added a data team to it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:13.385Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:13.611Z)

Right, Howard?

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:13.815Z)

either one of the things

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:14.911Z)

Don't know if you know

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:14.965Z)

they might be having trouble with you you brought this up last week when we talked.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:17.861Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:19.565Z)

It's he said that it's really easy to get to GOP but it's hard to get to NOI.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:22.201Z)

You know, Drew, one of the things they might be having trouble with you you brought this

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:25.745Z)

And that might be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:26.301Z)

up last week when we talked.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:26.955Z)

like, that's true.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:28.221Z)

Is

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:28.275Z)

Right? Like, if I just imagine if operators are sending

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:28.811Z)

you said that it's really easy to get to GOP but it's hard to get to NOI.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:31.585Z)

CBR all of their p and l's, then I bet the data about

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:34.521Z)

And that might be, like, that's true. Right? Like, and I can just imagine

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:36.555Z)

issue probably sit more like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:38.471Z)

if operators are sending CBRE all of their p and l's

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:38.825Z)

with real estate taxes, insurance, like those below GOP line item.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:43.771Z)

then I bet the data validation issue probably sit more

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:44.905Z)

Just have to go be my my guess on that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:47.361Z)

with real estate taxes, insurance, like those

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:48.175Z)

Did you get a really great point is that if you're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:49.971Z)

below the GOP line items.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:51.065Z)

if all of our competitors help you really

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:53.371Z)

I just thought that would be my

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:53.425Z)

great. That competitor is on data. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:55.531Z)

my guess on that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:56.315Z)

the the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:56.821Z)

Because you made a really great point is that if we're

### You (2025-06-23T19:40:57.125Z)

is what Cindy has to screen. Now doing with her new robot.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:40:59.931Z)

all of our competitors, they'll be really great not competitors on data. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:00.355Z)

And this is what hot stats is doing. Right? And profits are they said they're gonna be really

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:04.901Z)

the this is what Cindy Essis Green is now doing with her new rollout.

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:05.405Z)

good getting to the GOP line. They're not gonna care after the GOP line.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:09.271Z)

And this is what Hot Stats is doing. Right? And

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:10.535Z)

To the NOI line. And that's where, like, we have to add that value

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:12.291Z)

profit sort is that they're gonna be really good at getting to the GOP line, but they're not gonna care

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:14.995Z)

is getting it to the NOI line. Well, if you get below that, right,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:17.261Z)

the GOP line. We need it to the NOI line, and that's where

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:18.715Z)

ideally, you get all the way to the net income line. You get interest expense, owner expense, prepaid, and acquisition. We we get a lot of that data in most

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:21.811Z)

like, we have to add that value is getting it to the NOI line. Well, even below that, right, you

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:26.385Z)

cases. But it's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:27.471Z)

Ideally, you get all the way to the net income line if you can get interest

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:28.415Z)

it's very painstaking. And to be honest,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:30.761Z)

expense, owner expense, depreciation, amortization. I mean, we get we get a lot of that data in most cases.

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:31.795Z)

prospect, Robert's whole day was like, We tried take the data in any format from the operator to the owner to whoever to make

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:36.141Z)

But it's it's very painstaking.

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:38.595Z)

it simple for them.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:38.751Z)

And CBRE always took the prospect. Robert's whole thing was, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:39.385Z)

Which I agree with. However, think in doing that, they've kind of crossed over into

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:42.421Z)

we try to take the data in any format from the operators or the owners or whoever to make it simple for them.

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:45.075Z)

like, their span theirs. Like, it's easier

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:48.321Z)

Which I agree with.

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:49.825Z)

say, like, what you're doing.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:50.251Z)

However, I think in doing that, they've kind of crossed over into

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:51.045Z)

Be getting a data for twenty five years, but obviously, like, trust what we do. Just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:53.801Z)

like, their stay out they are, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:54.405Z)

set up an automated automated

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:41:56.211Z)

it would be easier just to say, like, look. You're giving you've been giving us data

### You (2025-06-23T19:41:56.405Z)

process where we just get data every month and just you know, that's it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:00.461Z)

for twenty five years. You obviously, like, trust what we do. Just

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:00.575Z)

Done. We'll we'll handle it out.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:03.101Z)

set up an automated automated process where we just get data every month and just

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:03.315Z)

But Deepgram has we've been going to, like, make that work.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:07.431Z)

you know, that's it. Done. And we'll we'll handle the rest.

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:08.855Z)

Said. You know, they they did not have done that entire if they want to be able. To make me.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:12.151Z)

But

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:12.595Z)

And the project

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:13.181Z)

CBRA hasn't been willing to, like, make that or at least Robert said, you know,

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:17.625Z)

But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:18.321Z)

they they had not done that yet. He's not sure if they would be able they they

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:19.455Z)

for yeah,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:21.321Z)

at the time, wouldn't be interested in it, but that was my whole my whole

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:21.845Z)

I

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:24.841Z)

pitch to them at the time.

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:25.045Z)

a challenge. It's a central control.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:26.361Z)

But Right. Yeah. I mean, we have a lot of data validation in check, but it is a it is a challenge.

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:33.905Z)

It's, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:34.681Z)

So, Drew, if

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:35.505Z)

you know, turn or

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:38.841Z)

if I may ask, how do you, like, do the data validation? It's like

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:39.515Z)

different sources or we the operators to submit the data. Or when a user submit

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:44.421Z)

your own logic of return or, like, you compare different sources or

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:45.475Z)

data, they are required to enter basically, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:49.411Z)

We basically when the operators submit the data or when a user submits

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:49.775Z)

what that data what the correct amount should be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:54.141Z)

data,

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:54.575Z)

So they sent it today

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:54.791Z)

they are required

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:56.095Z)

file.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:42:56.231Z)

to enter basically, like, what that data what the

### You (2025-06-23T19:42:59.195Z)

Is gonna have it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:00.431Z)

correct amounts should be.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:01.205Z)

All this stuff. And with me. Submit that file,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:03.341Z)

Do they submit a data file? It's really like a trial balance.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:03.905Z)

they have to put you know, here's the revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:06.761Z)

And the trial balance is gonna have revenues, expenses, statistics, all this stuff. And when they

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:07.155Z)

Ready for the 800,000,000. Opportunities expenses should be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:11.341Z)

submit that file, they have to put you know, here's the revenue. Revenue should be 100,000,000.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:16.745Z)

Whatever. And you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:18.191Z)

Operating expenses should be, you know, 40,000,000.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:19.495Z)

we're still and labor expense, they have to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:21.631Z)

Non operating or or below GOP should be 25,000,000, whatever it is.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:21.965Z)

take that in. That's like the most basic way

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:26.201Z)

And

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:26.735Z)

the whole thing works.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:27.061Z)

you know, rooms available, rooms sold, and labor expense. They have to

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:27.995Z)

You know, the next level of this conversation would be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:30.751Z)

type that information in

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:31.565Z)

take it. They can be on

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:32.741Z)

That is, like, the most basic way that

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:32.925Z)

on it. Process. Where you can have a system

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:35.571Z)

the whole thing works.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:35.975Z)

automatically set the next

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:36.861Z)

You know, the next level up as far as sophistication would be that they can

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:37.385Z)

one. To an FTP. And the FTP, when when you submit that data, you need to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:40.921Z)

can be, like, an automated process.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:42.495Z)

have a hetero

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:43.051Z)

Where you can have a system automatically send an export to an FTP

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:43.685Z)

it says revenue, expenses, whatever, you know, she appears supposed

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:47.481Z)

And the FTP, like, when you submit that data, it either needs to have a header row

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:47.685Z)

be. Know, these numbers. It can be a separate control file. Where you got a data

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:52.451Z)

that says revenues, expenses, whatever. You know, GOP are supposed to be

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:52.495Z)

file to control file. And the control file set you know, ready to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:43:56.851Z)

these numbers, or it can be a separate control file.

### You (2025-06-23T19:43:57.035Z)

EBITDA or whatever. So the system wants to cross

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:00.141Z)

Where you have a data file and a control file.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:00.415Z)

the call. The data. It can send your data.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:02.631Z)

The control file says,

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:02.835Z)

Revenue, EOP,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:04.131Z)

you know, revenue, GOP, EBITDA are supposed to be whatever.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:05.345Z)

system now. To provide. Checkbox.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:07.751Z)

So the system, once it processes all of the data, it can say, okay. Does

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:09.205Z)

You know, that kind of

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:11.701Z)

revenue, GOP, etcetera, in our system match what was in the

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:12.145Z)

the third an API. No one has given us enough

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:15.451Z)

the provided check file.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:16.465Z)

this one.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:18.051Z)

You know, that's that's kind of the next level up. And then

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:19.225Z)

Encounter. Just not on the table.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:21.001Z)

the third would be an API that no one has given us API access at this point.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:21.695Z)

At this point. So so I think the near future, it will be. And then we'll have to figure out how you validate. Could you

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:25.801Z)

Of those, you know, 50 plus operators we encounter. That's

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:27.965Z)

free of profit out

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:29.381Z)

just not on the table at this point. Some some, I think,

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:29.615Z)

of the two most commonly

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:31.981Z)

the near future, it will be, and then we'll have to figure out how do you validate

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:34.535Z)

one hundred one hundred. If they have validation issues.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:35.511Z)

because even even m three and profits work, which are two of the two most commonly

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:38.925Z)

For them. You know, for

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:39.611Z)

I would say, like, systems, an accounting system, and an ERP system that interact one another one another,

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:40.695Z)

a a particular customer, I would think. And I used to work. You

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:44.581Z)

even they have validation issues between their own systems for for the you know, for a a particular customer. Right? Like, Davidson, where I used to work, uses m three for accounting.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:50.035Z)

obviously, like, within existing within the single customer for you.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:54.271Z)

Profits or for forecasting and budgeting.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:54.275Z)

Think they have that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:56.221Z)

And sometimes that data match.

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:58.195Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:58.211Z)

It's obviously, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:44:59.265Z)

What and is that the pushback you're getting on the APIs? Is it

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:44:59.601Z)

within an existing within the one single customer where you would think they'd have that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:03.555Z)

privacy, security,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:04.031Z)

Down path, but it's it does not.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:06.275Z)

cost?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:07.011Z)

So And I would just like to make another

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:08.695Z)

Cost for what? It's a very minor Yeah. Security, another are set up.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:14.041Z)

cost

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:14.195Z)

In such a way. If I was like we do this, we do it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:17.871Z)

for one, even though it's very minor,

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:18.115Z)

This way. Starlight Capital And

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:19.681Z)

security, another. A lot of these APIs are set up in such a way that

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:20.755Z)

they have three four accounts managed by date. Same hotel. So, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:24.251Z)

if I was the like, we do biz we do business with

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:25.345Z)

we don't want data for those three or four hotels.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:27.411Z)

Starwood Capital,

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:27.815Z)

But in order to use

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:28.751Z)

and they have three or four hotels managed by Davidson Hotels.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:29.295Z)

the profit store API, for the s three API, it's all or nothing.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:32.981Z)

So, like, we only want data for those three or four hotels,

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:33.495Z)

So the FDA API,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:36.671Z)

But in order to use the profit sort API,

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:37.135Z)

in a state of health care and operator,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:39.601Z)

or the m three API, it's all or nothing. So the API either gives you access to all the hotels within a particular customer,

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:43.415Z)

Good. Right? That way, you know, if they just get access to the weird properties,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:47.121Z)

operator, or

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:48.355Z)

And then the other part is that just So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:48.611Z)

none of them. So that's and that is something that I think they are working on.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:50.485Z)

control. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:52.201Z)

Right? In that way, David just could say, just give access to these three or four properties.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:52.545Z)

Yeah. And so one thing I just I'm gonna connect some industry dots.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:45:57.241Z)

And then the other part is I think just So It's a control issue.

### You (2025-06-23T19:45:57.435Z)

So m three recently entered into

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:01.631Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:01.635Z)

a call

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:02.031Z)

And so one thing I just I'm gonna connect some industry dots.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:02.495Z)

joint. Venture partnership with Blackstone venture capital.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:06.221Z)

So m three recently entered into they

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:08.495Z)

Fruit. And they it's the first outside

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:10.621Z)

call it a joint venture partnership

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:12.125Z)

investor that they've had I'm sure they're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:13.731Z)

with Blackstone's venture

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:14.525Z)

gearing up for competition.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:16.371Z)

capital.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:17.115Z)

I'm

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:17.621Z)

Group. And they it's the first outside investor that they've had

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:17.965Z)

we had a mark our call with

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:22.341Z)

I'm sure they're gearing up for competition, as that space because we

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:23.325Z)

oh, hospitality investor apps, h I a, They're a competitor to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:26.831Z)

we had a mark our call with

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:27.925Z)

three. And so I just wanna put that on the table too because and

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:32.181Z)

oh, Hospitality Investor Apps, HIA,

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:32.365Z)

three, is the McKibben.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:35.071Z)

a competitor to m three. And so I just wanna put that on the table too because

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:35.135Z)

Like, I'm kinda thinking the McKibbens almost like a family office in some ways in the hospitality industry.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:40.701Z)

m three is the McKibbens. Like, I kinda think of the

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:42.515Z)

Right? Is it it through answering the given Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:46.601Z)

kibbens almost like a family office in some ways and the hospitality

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:47.175Z)

Yeah. Right. Right. So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:49.741Z)

industry. It would be real right? Isn't isn't Drew m three the McKibbens?

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:50.135Z)

easy. Get in front of the on something like this and say, you know, I I'm

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:53.901Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:54.695Z)

just gonna go out

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:55.101Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:55.545Z)

on a limb.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:55.971Z)

Yeah. Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-23T19:46:56.415Z)

Maybe the would have some interest in something like this because they're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:46:57.581Z)

So it'd be really easy for us to get in front of the McKibbens on something like this and say, I

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:00.185Z)

investors in addition to being

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:02.491Z)

you know, I I'm I'm just gonna go out on a limb.

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:03.685Z)

having a property manager.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:05.111Z)

Maybe the McKibbens would have some interest in something like this because they're

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:05.825Z)

Platform. Yeah. And God that if they if we could get them three as opposed

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:09.391Z)

investors in addition to being,

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:09.985Z)

over of get kitted. In m three as a partner, we could have

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:12.641Z)

having a property management

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:13.185Z)

be awesome? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:14.631Z)

platform. And god, if they if we could get m three a or if we could give them to kibbens and m three as a partner, wouldn't that be awesome? Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:16.155Z)

would you have, like, if they were to like like that? Your pulmonary the challenges that you could foresee I like I mean, if they were to if you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:24.241Z)

what what would be the like, if they were to agree to something like that, Drew, what would be the challenges?

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:24.355Z)

and three years, think, and three years partly zero.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:28.731Z)

That you could foresee?

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:29.405Z)

I don't know how that whole thing started, but

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:29.831Z)

I mean, if they would've if

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:31.425Z)

the the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:32.621Z)

well, m three even though I think m three is

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:33.985Z)

way. Of three dozen.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:36.901Z)

maybe partly or I don't know how that whole thing started, but

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:39.025Z)

Back. They see that less than some other ownership groups.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:40.291Z)

McKibbin does not seem to have a whole lot of sway into what m three does at this point.

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:41.515Z)

Which is first month operators which is surprising. But, I mean, you get an official

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:45.201Z)

Right? Okay. In fact, they seem to have less than some other ownership groups.

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:47.435Z)

pocket store to agree to be a partner, of some time, like, in some way, like, really

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:50.251Z)

Which is or some other operators, which is surprising.

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:51.965Z)

That might be it it does open up a lot of doors.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:53.671Z)

But, I mean, if you get m three or profits order to agree to be a partner,

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:54.785Z)

We are I don't know it's like. I would say, like, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:47:58.241Z)

of some like, in some way, like, to really

### You (2025-06-23T19:47:58.545Z)

they're close to being

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:00.771Z)

then I think it it does open up a lot of doors

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:02.615Z)

I guess I'm feeling it

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:03.621Z)

We are

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:03.745Z)

official partner

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:04.671Z)

fuck, I would, like, I would say, like, you know, very, very close to being

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:04.755Z)

Proposal, perhaps, like, really close. Which would open up

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:09.191Z)

I guess, I'd say, like, an official partner with

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:09.825Z)

in mid bet all the APIs. I think all of the data, they say, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:13.651Z)

ProfitZord or Actable, like, really close. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:15.525Z)

way, like, a a a

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:17.271Z)

Which would open up

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:17.385Z)

customer after service for

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:18.581Z)

make, you know, all the APIs, I think all the basically,

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:18.765Z)

works running, like, So we have this work. We don't share a anybody. Not.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:22.741Z)

we would become like, if you think about the way, like, a a a

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:22.925Z)

Like, trusted affiliate. Or, like, like, you know, we share with our attorneys and stuff like that, but we don't share

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:25.941Z)

customer master service agreement works. Right? Like, the way ours work is we don't share data with anybody that's not, like, a trusted affiliate

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:29.525Z)

beyond that. So if you become a partner, I think your foot starts if you guys live

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:33.201Z)

or, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:33.415Z)

falls to that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:34.381Z)

like, you know, we share with our attorneys and stuff like that, but we don't share it

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:34.555Z)

Suddenly. And you get access to so much more

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:38.381Z)

beyond that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:38.695Z)

and it makes it so much easier.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:39.361Z)

If you become a partner, I think you start to you basically, like, fall into that group.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:41.515Z)

But you have to improve that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:43.421Z)

Suddenly.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:43.585Z)

know, you're that you

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:44.301Z)

And you get access to

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:45.605Z)

that you deserve to be in that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:46.081Z)

so much more it makes things so much easier.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:48.735Z)

Thank you. I I think again, like, work there. Like, I didn't tell you about certain

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:50.501Z)

But you have to prove that, you know, you're that you that you deserve to be in that group, I guess.

### You (2025-06-23T19:48:53.815Z)

comments. Again,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:48:57.811Z)

So I I think again, like, we're like, I've been talking from sort of for comments. So we the guy I've been talking to was he was surprised. He's like, your daughter's almost

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:06.045Z)

Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then it went out

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:07.121Z)

three. Holy holy shit. He's like, I remember when she was just born. So almost three years at this point.

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:08.195Z)

But you know, it's went out with as far as I can start like this,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:12.621Z)

I think we're pretty close. And I talked to two. Right. Yeah. Yep.

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:12.865Z)

enterprise comes along with it. Right? It's it's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:15.811Z)

Yeah. So I think when that when you know, if when that happens,

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:15.875Z)

it should be and like, you go on with it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:19.981Z)

far as I'm concerned, like, this

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:20.635Z)

And I think so.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:21.481Z)

this enterprise comes along with it. Right? It it it should be yeah. Like, it'll go along with it. And I think so any benefit that Hotel BIS gets, Invest AI can get as well.

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:30.135Z)

Has 12,000 Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:33.951Z)

And I think with them, then you get again, they have

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:34.185Z)

Yeah. And they they don't. Choose to have a validation. Honestly, they Oh, really?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:38.711Z)

you know, ten, twelve thousand. Date of validation. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:40.235Z)

No. No. It sure does. Right? I know I'm

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:42.691Z)

Yeah. Yeah. They they don't really have data validation. Honestly, they

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:44.825Z)

I'm jumping all around here, but never they have not been able to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:47.511Z)

Oh, really? No. Wow.

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:49.745Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:50.311Z)

No. But charity does. Right? I I know I'm I'm jumping all around here

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:53.815Z)

like a red herring

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:55.231Z)

But No. Data validation is

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:56.685Z)

Right? Like, walking

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:49:57.721Z)

somewhat of a somewhat I mean, to say that

### You (2025-06-23T19:49:58.515Z)

basically trying to say, like, wanna make sure my data is correct.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:00.281Z)

data validation is somewhat of a, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:01.525Z)

Well, then you can get back to, like, what

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:03.301Z)

a red herring. Right? It's like

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:03.505Z)

does it mean to be correct Right? I

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:06.571Z)

what you're you're basically trying to say, like, I wanna make sure my data is correct.

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:07.725Z)

if you go, like, just correct me.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:10.501Z)

But then you have to get back to, like, well, what

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:10.725Z)

The date my system matches the data

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:12.611Z)

does it mean to be correct?

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:13.585Z)

previous. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:15.281Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:15.785Z)

That's what step of correct.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:16.851Z)

you go, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:17.715Z)

But if

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:17.761Z)

does correct mean, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:18.065Z)

the data in the previous source. System.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:19.891Z)

data in my system matches the data in the pre in the previous source system?

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:20.455Z)

Correct? Well, that's another question. Right? Like, did somebody forget the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:24.041Z)

Right, that's one step of correct.

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:24.385Z)

forecast? At the beginning? They forget to put in orders available?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:26.671Z)

But is the data in the previous source system

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:27.135Z)

Then, you know, that's what we do, like, an obvious

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:29.541Z)

correct? Well, that's another question. Right? Like, did somebody forget to forecast

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:33.205Z)

they're supposed to.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:33.931Z)

FF and E? Did they forget to put in rooms available?

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:34.035Z)

Did they correctly book every single

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:36.341Z)

They you know, that's which is, like, an obvious thing that you'd be like, oh, well, that's easy to see.

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:38.045Z)

You just don't know. And that's where, like, that that accounting auditor comes in, and we can really

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:40.441Z)

Then you're like, well, did they put in all the invoices they're supposed to?

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:42.565Z)

be checking that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:43.071Z)

Did they correctly book every single you know, every nice income journal?

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:43.075Z)

Stuff, but you're not

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:47.061Z)

You just don't know, and that's where, like, an accounting auditor comes in

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:48.375Z)

to think about this shit. Right? Like

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:50.891Z)

should really be checking that stuff. But you're not it it's just like it goes back and back and back and back and back

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:51.165Z)

almost like a turn It doesn't need to all key. Much more narrow.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:55.831Z)

So so, like, to say data validation, right, it's like

### You (2025-06-23T19:50:56.945Z)

Definition. So we think, like, does does the thing that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:50:59.951Z)

almost like a term that doesn't mean a whole lot. You have to be

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:01.735Z)

max you? Operator data?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:02.731Z)

much more

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:03.905Z)

That

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:04.431Z)

narrow with your definition. So

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:04.965Z)

is a yes. Great. And it's valid. But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:06.971Z)

we say, like, does the does the data in Hotel BIS match the operator data?

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:08.865Z)

you know, beyond that, is the operator's The profit tool back at three the the forecast.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:12.951Z)

That if if yes,

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:14.905Z)

Accurate? I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:15.261Z)

great. Then it's validated.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:16.225Z)

that's like that's the operator.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:17.001Z)

But

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:17.835Z)

Call.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:17.921Z)

you know, beyond that, is the operator's data in profits org ProfitsOr match m three?

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:18.435Z)

But So I went to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:22.581Z)

Does the forecast accurate? I mean, that that's, like, the operator's problem.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:26.235Z)

That would be Right? They that could be data in their own

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:28.731Z)

So I when so with the CBRE, like, you know, they said they're having data

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:31.395Z)

means they're getting it. That

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:33.391Z)

or data validation issues.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:34.105Z)

that it it could mean they're

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:35.601Z)

That could mean anything. Right? That that could mean the data in their own databases.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:35.815Z)

the data they're having trouble now. They can

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:39.461Z)

Is messed up. That could mean they're getting incomplete data. That could mean

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:42.875Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:43.251Z)

I mean, it could mean that they're the data isn't they're having trouble mapping it. It just it could mean, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:44.245Z)

Okay. Yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:48.181Z)

so many different things or maybe all of it, honestly.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:48.815Z)

that on our side, as far as like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:50.671Z)

Mhmm. Okay.

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:52.725Z)

if

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:53.391Z)

Okay. But I, yeah, I think

### You (2025-06-23T19:51:53.425Z)

a month. We should placed. Check the balance.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:51:57.911Z)

on our side, as far as like, data data you're getting from us, like, I think we should put in place checks and balances

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:05.945Z)

Does revenue does revenue equal revenue, does GOP equal to GOP, you know, etcetera.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:07.721Z)

make sure that the data coming from Adobe IS, so when it gets into InnVestAI matches,

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:10.355Z)

Which part of the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:11.801Z)

which we can use the same methodology of header rows, like, does

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:12.005Z)

part of the API. You know, and then

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:15.271Z)

you know, does revenue equal revenue? Does GOP equal to GOP, you know, etcetera?

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:16.555Z)

for data market. From data

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:19.601Z)

Can make that part of the

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:19.895Z)

in our system. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:21.091Z)

part of the API.

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:21.435Z)

it's coming from a broker p and l or a seller p and l.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:23.701Z)

You know? And then for data that we're getting from

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:26.235Z)

I mean, that's tougher. I I don't

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:27.211Z)

data that's not in our system, right, like, that's coming from a

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:27.615Z)

I don't that tougher to to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:31.651Z)

a broker p and l or a seller p and l.

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:31.725Z)

determine my Is the it's the end.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:34.311Z)

Mean, that's tougher. I I don't

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:34.775Z)

Scraping the data in the right way?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:36.711Z)

I don't that it's tougher to to to

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:38.885Z)

Figure out, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:40.921Z)

determine what, like, is the is the AI scraping the data in the right way and putting the right numbers in the right place?

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:43.925Z)

Okay. I think I think we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:46.481Z)

It's hard hard to

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:46.505Z)

we will be able to do that. It's just a matter of figuring out the best way to do

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:47.921Z)

figure out, like, how to determine whether something is correct or not.

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:49.385Z)

it. Right. Right. Of course.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:53.001Z)

Okay. But I think I think we we will be able to do that. I think it's a matter of figuring out the

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:53.835Z)

You know, basically, assuming we try to receive

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:57.761Z)

best way to do it.

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:58.085Z)

potential fund raise

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:52:58.441Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-23T19:52:59.235Z)

anything. On this.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:00.381Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:00.535Z)

We just wanna make sure we have a good really good data validation.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:01.421Z)

And we're just gonna, you know, assuming assuming we do wanna try to go to CBRE potential fundraising on this,

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:03.745Z)

Pitch. And the store, by that point, that or if we I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:09.631Z)

just wanna make sure we have a good really good data validation pitch.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:10.495Z)

because we're doing here collectively

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:14.401Z)

And if you're working with store by that point, then or if we I mean, because

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:16.015Z)

with the ABM, you know, they might think it's interesting. I mean, have to do it themselves. But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:21.451Z)

they might like what we're doing here collectively with

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:21.805Z)

might be interested in a strategic partnership.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:25.161Z)

the ABM. You know? They might think it's interesting, and they didn't have to do it themselves. But

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:27.055Z)

Yeah. I'm more data part.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:29.811Z)

they they might be interested in a strategic partnership.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:30.735Z)

To see the You'll have to remove the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:32.971Z)

Yeah. So, again, closer to them than I am.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:33.295Z)

the data source as well. Right? So that will be what will be as for now.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:37.071Z)

If I want to page the data part to CBRE,

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:38.455Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:41.051Z)

you'll have to reveal the data source as well. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:41.215Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think there's no issue with that. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:44.741Z)

So that'll be hotel PS for now.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:44.825Z)

So I'm in I don't sorry. I'm I'm sorry.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:47.581Z)

Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:48.765Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:48.831Z)

Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. And that's I think there's no issue with that. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:51.565Z)

like, one by the reason is

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:53.281Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:53.725Z)

see. Is coming from

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:54.341Z)

So, I mean, so as far as the validation goes, so

### You (2025-06-23T19:53:55.035Z)

important areas. I think could work additional place. And the second validation is the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:53:59.811Z)

like, one validation is

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:01.355Z)

match between our system and our total BS.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:03.111Z)

it is coming from portal BIS, and they have good validation in place.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:04.085Z)

Alright. The data total BI's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:07.401Z)

And the second validation is, the match between our

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:07.885Z)

provided as and the data we have in our database. Matches. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:11.531Z)

and hotel b s.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:12.885Z)

That's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:13.141Z)

Right? The data hotel b s provided us

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:14.135Z)

the second level of variation. So that's what we

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:18.091Z)

the data we have in our database.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:19.645Z)

to do here. Right? Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:21.011Z)

Matches. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:21.995Z)

Right. And remember,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:22.031Z)

That's Mhmm. The

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:23.715Z)

thinking about this from a real estate perspective. Right? So

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:25.271Z)

second level of validation.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:27.375Z)

I just need to, like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:27.621Z)

What we need to do here. Right?

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:29.445Z)

some

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:29.751Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:30.035Z)

really awesome points. Where does it stop?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:31.381Z)

And remember, guys, we're thinking about this from a real estate perspective. Right? So

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:32.635Z)

And in my mind, it stops where where does it stop?

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:36.581Z)

just need to to, like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:37.545Z)

Tied to the operator.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:37.781Z)

to Drew, you make some really awesome points. Where does it stop?

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:39.375Z)

Numbers, right, revenue, and geo, key.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:41.751Z)

And in my mind,

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:42.215Z)

And y

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:43.031Z)

we we it stops where where does it does it

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:44.585Z)

different because the operators like Davidson and HCI are really

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:46.681Z)

tie to the operator's numbers? Right? Revenue and GOP? Yes.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:48.375Z)

good about putting realty taxes, insurance, and all of that

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:51.261Z)

NOI,

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:51.715Z)

in. But I'm working with a small operator right now called Cana, which

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:53.251Z)

could be different because the operators like Davidson and HEI are

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:55.975Z)

Hotels. Then

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:54:57.231Z)

really good about putting real estate taxes, insurance, and all that in.

### You (2025-06-23T19:54:57.375Z)

put real estate taxes or insurance in. So I have, like, high for that hotel that's Evans. Like, I have no idea. Like, I don't even know

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:01.361Z)

But I'm working with an a small operator right now called Canna Hotels.

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:03.585Z)

I'm still trying to figure out.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:05.641Z)

And they don't even put real estate taxes or insurance in.

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:05.945Z)

Who's paying the rent taxes. Right? So, again, I'm guessing it's those smaller operators that are

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:08.721Z)

I have, like, I for that hotel that's Evans, like, have no idea. Like, I don't even know.

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:11.175Z)

more of a challenge on the on the

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:13.631Z)

I'm still trying to figure out

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:14.035Z)

fixed expenses.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:15.181Z)

who's paying the real estate taxes. Right? So I think I'm guessing it's those smaller operators that are more of a challenge on the,

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:15.435Z)

I'm just as you know, each other the their company. But now finish my point. Which is

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:22.621Z)

on those fixed expenses.

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:22.825Z)

if the revenue is matched and the GDP match

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:24.751Z)

Just because of the the nature of

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:25.175Z)

and the NOI matches to grander

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:27.631Z)

the of

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:28.245Z)

panel

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:28.541Z)

their company. But but now let me just finish my point, which is

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:28.915Z)

that comes up from a us. We have back. It's close enough

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:32.041Z)

if the revenues match and the GOP matches and the NOI matches,

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:32.925Z)

NOI. Right? That it's like, yeah, like, you can

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:35.991Z)

to the operator's PNL,

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:36.865Z)

know, you know, thousand dollars difference gonna it's

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:38.131Z)

then thumbs up from us. We haven't validated. It's close enough to NOI, right, that

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:40.325Z)

not gonna you know, pressure value or anything like that. You saying it's like,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:43.721Z)

it's like now we can do like, we can

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:44.845Z)

talking about because of the whole

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:46.001Z)

you know, you know, a thousand dollars difference isn't gonna it's not gonna

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:47.165Z)

it's we're talking about the capital

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:50.111Z)

you know, crush a value or anything like that. You know what I'm saying? It's like,

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:51.415Z)

That a small difference if we're off

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:53.581Z)

we're we're talking about because of the whole

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:54.835Z)

is isn't gonna keep the end of the world.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:55:56.481Z)

because we're we're talking about the capitalization of it, right, that

### You (2025-06-23T19:55:57.565Z)

Yeah. One thing that we would do in something like that, I think from what I'm hearing is that we would be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:56:01.141Z)

a small difference if we're off

### You (2025-06-23T19:56:03.625Z)

fairly confident

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:56:04.061Z)

isn't isn't gonna be the end of the world.

### You (2025-06-23T19:56:04.825Z)

We would be very confident down to the GOP. And pretty confident down to the NOI. Right? Except for the the exception that you just mentioned. So the the thing to to realize is that when we go to March with our comp data, we're gonna be aggregating it. Right? And we're gonna we're gonna be creating an average We're not going to show, well, here's CBRE property. And here's what the other one that you mentioned, you know, that these do have

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:56:39.791Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-23T19:56:42.725Z)

insurance and taxes and we and everything else where but this one doesn't have it in there. When you're creating the average, you know, we would we would not include the properties that don't have the taxes and real estate Yeah. Yeah. So it's basically an apples to apples. And what you can do is you can always say, well, are five or nine hotels

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:57:08.231Z)

Information.

### You (2025-06-23T19:57:10.165Z)

in this big group. But down here for the insurance and taxes that we didn't have, there's only five hotels in there. But those five, here is the average. Right? So without divulging the actual source of the data, and and getting down to that level, When we're talking about averages, you know, and if we can say, yep, these are these are apples to apples comparisons for what amenities these deal have. We're not comparing the Hyatt Regency against the Motel eight. Know, as long as we can put apples to apples in there. We should be fine. Should we just focus on the GOP line? Because, you know, Wilson, Texas for a matter of public record. Right. So if someone was looking at a hotel that they could easily

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:00.971Z)

Or or should we just should we just focus on the GOP line?

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:02.305Z)

or relatively sleep. Look up.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:04.211Z)

Right? Because, you know, real estate taxes

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:04.305Z)

Taxes. And and the truth is with insurance.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:06.771Z)

are a matter of public record.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:07.375Z)

Those numbers fluctuate dramatically year to

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:08.401Z)

So if someone was looking at a hotel that they could easily

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:09.595Z)

year. And a lot of times, insurance costs are a function of what the owner and management company is. Yeah. So if you don't

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:11.621Z)

relatively easily look up taxes. And and the truth is with insurance,

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:15.785Z)

tell us

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:16.111Z)

those numbers fluctuate dramatically year to year.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:16.385Z)

by a big national company, you could save some money on insurance, whereas if someone's buying a hotel, they're gonna self manage it.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:19.601Z)

And a lot of times, insurance costs are a function of who the owner and management company is.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:21.735Z)

Insurance costs would go up. But

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:24.061Z)

So if your hotel is managed by a big national company,

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:24.065Z)

you know, it's it's generally standard at 4%.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:27.211Z)

could save some money on insurance. Whereas if someone's buying the hotel and gonna self manage it,

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:27.795Z)

You know, medically. So maybe are we better

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:30.961Z)

insurance cost would go up and

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:30.985Z)

just focusing on

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:33.401Z)

know, f f and e is is generally standard at at 4% and, you know, management fee. So

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:33.465Z)

more reliable. Yeah. What if you the benchmark data

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:38.371Z)

maybe are we better off just

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:39.605Z)

for? Right.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:40.591Z)

focusing on the GOP line? Depends on what you're information is more reliable.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:40.955Z)

And I think about how it's benchmarking data and so great for the benchmarking.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:44.961Z)

Yeah. So the like, what are you using the benchmark data for?

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:45.895Z)

Let me ask you this. Decide now. Yeah. You're thinking out loud.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:49.221Z)

Right? And I think a lot of benchmarking data is operational benchmarking.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:49.505Z)

Me me the work. Yeah. Well, just

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:53.611Z)

Which is But but we have decide now, but just

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:53.905Z)

Yeah. Just for my own for my own sanity, though.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:58:57.891Z)

thinking out loud, maybe it's that's the, more efficient way to go.

### You (2025-06-23T19:58:57.895Z)

Is our initial proof of concept is going to be the automated valuation models.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:00.881Z)

At least for the at least for version one.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:03.195Z)

So what line do we need to calculate the value? Are we calculating it on the NOI? With the county? If that's the case. Yeah. That's the case. At least for that, for that product.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:15.601Z)

NOI.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:15.765Z)

You know, you have to get down to the NOI. Yeah. Yeah. That's when we get that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:18.981Z)

No. We need NOI.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:20.085Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:20.561Z)

Yeah. We have to have NOI. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:20.875Z)

That's always gonna be

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:22.621Z)

Yeah. That's a good point.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:23.645Z)

seller. Therefore, we can provide that. For

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:26.391Z)

Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll always get that.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:29.225Z)

That that's what I'm saying is, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:29.481Z)

We that that's always gonna be, like, right, from a from a broker seller. They're

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:30.985Z)

for our core product above the valuation model,

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:33.431Z)

always gonna provide that

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:34.415Z)

we just need to make sure we get down to the NOI. And they're only gonna need it

### Guest (2025-06-23T19:59:34.671Z)

Or from us, like, we always get that. It's always included.

### You (2025-06-23T19:59:38.305Z)

for that deal. Right? You're only underwriting a deal. You're gonna get that information. For aggregated market data to compare then, yeah, I think, you know, first off, let's focus on the GOP. And then see how much data we can get for remainder of the line items to get down to the NOI. And that's just going to be that's just all going to be based on how clients can we get uploading the data. And the, you know, the more we get uploading it, the better chance we'll have sufficient volume for line items to create a

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:13.311Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:13.455Z)

confident average mean, median, all these different things that they'll wanna look at. Right? So I have I have to go Yep. But say before we at it, like crazy.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:31.811Z)

I have I have another call, so I have to go.

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:33.045Z)

And, like, I know I did maybe

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:35.701Z)

Okay. But

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:36.485Z)

to think about

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:36.801Z)

what I was gonna say is maybe we

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:38.045Z)

know, bring our thoughts on pricing

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:38.861Z)

did we look at, like, creating a

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:40.745Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:40.921Z)

a TAM and, like I know we haven't I just think each of us should be

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:43.095Z)

the,

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:45.001Z)

maybe do this next time. Try to think about, you know, bring our thoughts on pricing.

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:48.865Z)

get.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:49.171Z)

And the, you know,

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:49.235Z)

Now. Take us to ramp and at what price and all of that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:50.531Z)

market, like the TAM for this product,

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:52.355Z)

Yeah. If you have smart

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:53.281Z)

And

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:53.935Z)

Howard, you know, in the three months Yeah. We thought that.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:55.371Z)

you know, how many customers are there and how many do do you think we can get

### You (2025-06-23T20:00:56.375Z)

Yeah. I just do something in the chat that I created and I created another folder on the team site, and

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:00:58.431Z)

how long would it take us to ramp and at what price and all of that.

### You (2025-06-23T20:01:01.345Z)

uploaded.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:01:01.411Z)

Maybe that's Mark, Diane, Howard, you're not the three of us can Yeah. Can really think about that.

### You (2025-06-23T20:01:01.985Z)

All the stuff that I've been generating up So if we can maybe consolidate everything there and

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:01:05.611Z)

Yep. Sounds good.

### You (2025-06-23T20:01:08.755Z)

take a look at it and make a decision. I Sounds good. Thanks a lot, guys. Alright. Good Bye. Thanks.

### Guest (2025-06-23T20:01:19.571Z)

Alright. Sounds good. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks, Drew. Bye. Bye. Thanks.
