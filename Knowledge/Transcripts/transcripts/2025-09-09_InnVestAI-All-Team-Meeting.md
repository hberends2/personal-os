### Guest (2025-09-09T21:30:18.455Z)

Howard.

### You (2025-09-09T21:30:18.637Z)

Hey, drew. How are you doing?

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:30:20.935Z)

Doing well, how are you?

### You (2025-09-09T21:30:21.917Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:30:24.695Z)

Hello, everyone.

### You (2025-09-09T21:30:25.837Z)

Even old.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:30:26.375Z)

Hello. How are you guys?

### You (2025-09-09T21:30:29.677Z)

Shoot. I left something downstairs. I'll be right back.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:30:42.375Z)

Hey, guys. Hello. I am running. I keep teaching my daughter that you have to reach five minutes before you keep what? You should reach five minutes before animating or class or anything. And I myself sometimes get laid here to be early. Oh, yeah. Or on time at least, right? Yeah. Do you know if Mark is joining by chance? I believe so. I talked to him this morning. We can go ahead. Some of this is probably not interesting to him or. We already talked about it today. So operating agreement. And you and I will talk about that. After this, I believe. Yeah. Am I getting progress on an immigration attorney? No, not really. Immigration attorney. Thank you. All this stuff just in progress. The budget. It sounds like you guys discussed, but there's not something broken out by month yet. Correct. And that's in my court. Vinod and Howard and I talked about it, and they gave me some updated numbers. I just have to put it in my spreadsheet. I think it's $560 in monthly subscription costs. But I am including other things as well. Like of course the engineer cost, but then also what it would look like if we got funding and could start to pay owner draw and pay for carry and pay for some other things. Yeah. The way I sort of laid it out here is that those. Marketing costs would go into customer, investor, product cost. That's really just the descriptions, Howard, that you have, and then everything else is pretty much in technology. Or in founder pay, and we would just. I think the point is that we would be able to use this. A framework for discussing. How much can we develop with what we have? What's the timeline? When are we going to need money next? Obviously, I think the answer is probably as soon as possible. But how much are we asking? How much do we need to ask for? From who do we get it? Et cetera. Right? So this will be, I think, the framework that we use to discuss all of that. But right now, the pox say the number. You're incomplete. Andrew might be kind of the opposite discussion, too. We might say. All right, we now have three investors at X amount total. What's the highest priority? What's the second highest priority? You know what I mean? It might be the reverse of that as well. Once we get another investor. What's the highest and best use of those funds? Right, because getting Vinod off of his full time job is probably one of our. One of our. Highest ROI opportunities. Howard and I need to have something to survive on, and then we need Carrie. I'm really impressed with her, and I feel like she could help us with our initial marketing material. I'm saving the obvious. It's just one is the flip of the other all part of the same conversation. All right. As far as expenses go. Hey, mark. Hey, mark. I think you're on mute. Hello. Mark. So we just started going through this. We were just talking about the budget. Which is Diane is breaking out five months. So hopefully the next couple of days we'll have back, we can populate it into a. What I have here, which is like a framework we can use to discuss roadmap, timeline, budget, all collectively. As far as expenses go, Benod has been putting everything on one of my cards. Which we'll link up to the bank account when it's set up. Diane and Howard anything, I think any expenses you have put on that card as well. Okay? The one that Howard needs the most and Howard jumped. Then if I'm wrong is don't you need your no code or what is it? You need something that's like $78 a month, right? If I'm. If I'm remembering it right.

### You (2025-09-09T21:36:28.077Z)

Yeah. It's not urgent that I have to have it right away.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:36:33.815Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-09T21:36:34.877Z)

I can continue to use my existing level of subscription. Yeah, I'm going to have to have one or the other.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:36:46.215Z)

I think that's fine. If you're going to break the bank for a couple months.

### You (2025-09-09T21:36:46.317Z)

Ready. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:36:55.735Z)

But just to the extent that. You want to. Or. I mean, eventually, we need to get all the expenses consolidated, regardless. If it's urgent for either of you personally, from a cash flow perspective, then do it. Let me know. I guess we got probably to log into the. If it's Microsoft or whatever, log into the administrative portal of that product. Vendor. System, whatever, and then replace your payment method with mine. So I'm happy to.

### You (2025-09-09T21:37:25.197Z)

Yeah, I think I will probably need that. On one of them. I just need to decide which one to go with. The Gen Spark that I put down for $25 a month is not something we need right away. So that when I can go with. But the other One that was 100amonth is probably the one that I would have to continue using.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:37:52.455Z)

Yeah, that's fine. I think I remember seeing that in the budget. So just when you're ready, we can just do that together. I have the credit card. Or I can give it to you the way I did benod and you could just swap out what the current payment method with this one. As far as pitch decos. So I then took what you had done, what Mark had done in the past, and tried to consolidate this. Is just sort of verbiage and framework. And I was going to put it into whatever the pop AI thing that made that other pitch deck that were good. So I was going to do something that. Do something similar with this. But I wanted to run the content by you guys first. So our mission. Creating the hotel industry standard for AI driven analytics. Developed by hotel people specifically for hotel people. Designed to increase efficiency. Performance. Resulting in enhanced performance. Right, so all the verbiage can be. Can be tweaked? Yeah, absolutely. Basically, just our mission, our motto, our tagline. And then the first slide would be talking about the problem facing hotel investors today. As far as how we do things. Yeah, I just really feel strongly about this and I have to make a ploy for this is I know this is the language we've been using and this is the language that dealpath uses and everything, but I feel this conversation is changing. And the problem is now leaders don't really know how to they don't really under it stand AI. And they don't know how to implement AI. So in the pitch deck, I'll cut you up. We're building to that. But I can say that I've talked to a lot of people about what we're doing. And when I tell them that we're removing them from their safety blanket, also known as their Excel model, And we're moving them into a new format. I could see the look on their face, and it's like we just insulted their mother. And I think we have to just before we get into what we're trying to accomplish, I think we have to kind of explain. Why we're moving them out of Excel. Again, I don't think. We're not trying to change the narrative or we're trying to just build up to it. Does that make sense? Yeah. What I tried to do here is incorporate because I agree, Diane. It's twofold. Right. This has been the problem for a long time, and now that basically, now that AI and technology is here and the rest of CRE is exploding with it, Hotel investors have sort of like, now the problem is. Okay, well, I know I need to use this, and I should, and I can. How do I do that? We go here, Diane? More like introductory page, which we can. Part of this is also we're trying to lay it out. In a way that's going to flow when we do presentations. So, like, the first page, we. You know, we could always go faster or slower on each page. Depending on how our audience is reacting. But we want to make sure all the words are there so that we don't forget to kind of say certain things.

### You (2025-09-09T21:41:07.837Z)

So, to make sure I understand correctly, this is just like a script, right? This isn't client facing the word document.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:41:14.615Z)

Well, it could be client facing. I mean, you know, when we do calls, And, you know, if we're meeting with a potential user, And we're trying to introduce what we're building here. You know, this is designed to kind of give them an overview of what we're doing, why we're doing it right. And this will hopefully lead to a demo to show them what the product looks like, but I think we have to introduce it first. We need two things, right? We need an investor pitch deck. And we need a client deck. Right. But a lot of this will be for both. But what we're meeting with an investor will have pages like for TAM and projections and our, you know, there'll be more pages for an investor. But I still think you need to give them sort of the reasons why we're doing this in the history. And, you know, you have to kind of set the table before you eat dinner. Yeah. This is a deck that was created by an AI application. Called? I think it's Pop AI or something like that.

### You (2025-09-09T21:42:15.277Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:42:15.335Z)

But I basically just put the verbiage in and it spit this out. It looks good.

### You (2025-09-09T21:42:19.757Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:42:20.215Z)

You know, relatively speaking.

### You (2025-09-09T21:42:21.517Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:42:22.055Z)

But we just needed to clean up the verbiage and the context and the organization, and that's what this is. So, yes, it'll serve as a script as well as the foundation for multiple. I mean, all of our decks.

### You (2025-09-09T21:42:35.677Z)

So. So the reason I brought that up is particularly with the Excel, I think, you know, mentioning about the. Validated errors that were done by studies, but not as a bullet point. I was thinking just like a footnote at the bottom of the page. I doubt that anybody's going to actually go and try to find those documents. But if we have a citation at the bottom of the page, then it's like, oh, yeah, okay, so they're not just pulling numbers out of thin air, right? We can.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:43:08.695Z)

Yeah, yeah, 100%. That could be something. And can you give you something we speak to during a demo or intro presentation as well?

### You (2025-09-09T21:43:17.757Z)

Which. Which is why I asked, if this was something you would actually hand to a client, would that therefore they would just see the footnote down there? We could have the name of the study, the year and everything, make it look really legit, which is. You know what I mean. You know what?

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:43:31.175Z)

Y ep yeah, yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-09T21:43:32.397Z)

I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:43:37.335Z)

So then getting again the challenge. Now, you know, how do you leverage this technology for hotels? And then the solution, you know, is here. InnVestAI developed buy hotel investors for hotel investors. And trying to speak to. Like, pain points and what this looks like, if you use this product, here's what, like, here's what you'll. You'll see, right? Or how you'll benefit the workflow Automation design by hospitality. And this is from your deck, Diane. Security connectivity. Yeah. Proprietary purpose built data model with you, Sally, and tells us to the KPIs. Right. So this is like kind of trying to bring together these two pain points and say that this, this is the solution. And then this is. And then the 4 slide would be a little bit of features and functionality.

### You (2025-09-09T21:44:36.077Z)

So, Drew, let me jump in real quick. Can you remind me again what is use daily is?

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:44:38.775Z)

Yeah. Uniform system of accounts for the lodging industry.

### You (2025-09-09T21:44:44.157Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:44:45.495Z)

Anybody in hop hospitality will know that right off the bat.

### You (2025-09-09T21:44:48.957Z)

I knew it was something about unified accounts. I just couldn't remember exactly what they were. Okay, but it is specific to hospitality.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:44:49.175Z)

Isn't it? Yeah. Yay. Very. Yes, yes.

### You (2025-09-09T21:44:57.597Z)

Rules, okay?

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:45:00.695Z)

And then, you know, benefits or, you know, functionality and benefits being right. Analyze more deals. Be more efficient. Includes your closing ratios. And we could put more things in here, right? Like underwriting models. Populate automatically. AI generated market research oms, investor memos. You know, remote team members simultaneously collaborate all this stuff, right? These are the things, like, if you're thinking about, like, what does my life look like after this is implemented, right? These are all the best. These are all kind of the features that you get benefit from. This is who is beneficial to. Brokers, investors, asset managers, lenders, management companies. We can add. We'll put a slide. Appraisers. Do you have appraisers up there? No. We can add those. Type of appraisers last? I don't know. How to slide for 10. And this one would be, you know, one of the slides that we add or remove, depending on who we're talking to. We're talking to a potential customer or even a hospitality. So how do you guys propose handling this? Because Howard did send out some really interesting conversational pieces about that, including a TAM slide with actual numbers. Almost makes you look foolish. I mean, I don't know how to explain that. Howard, can you. Like, you remember that article that you sent out that was, like, it almost turns in. It almost turns potential investors off because it's such a big number that it's hard to believe.

### You (2025-09-09T21:46:39.117Z)

Yeah. Well, not that it's such a big number because. But tam, if the TAM is total, total accessible market. But people will say, okay, that is, if you could sell to 100% of the consumers. This is what I'll get. Right. So in our case, we could have a tam for the us and then the tam for global. Right, because we could go outside of our shores. But nobody is going to get 100% of all clients on their product. So a lot of investors now, they're just like, whatever, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a meaningless number. So then there's the. Sam and the psalm, which I need to. Again, I forget exactly what they are. But it's a funnel, right? So then you've got your total potential 100%. Then you've got the potential that is more aligned with your business and market. And then there's what's realistic. How many of that are you really going to get? Are you going to get 20% of what you could? 50%, you know? That's where we need it. It's. It's actually the bottom of the funnel, which is what we would project to be our.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:48:03.655Z)

Yeah, no, I completely agree with that. I mean, I think we're six to 12 months away from having TAM discussions. I think at this point, we're selling investors on the dream.

### You (2025-09-09T21:48:09.837Z)

Yeah, yeah. Y.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:48:13.335Z)

And, you know, we're trying to resonate with them that this is what the industry needs. And it's almost like at this point, investors are taking a leap, a leap of faith in us. As we get further down the road. We can get into. Tam. I did have a. Just as a side note, I know Drew is trying to keep us on schedule, which I appreciate. But I did have attended a webinar today. Someone inadvertently and got comparative pricing. I know we've been talking about pricing, so we can go talk about it at the end of the call if you want, but I did get some pricing, comparative pricing information today.

### You (2025-09-09T21:48:44.957Z)

One more point on that. Then I did also saw another one that basically you can start off with TAM and, you know, possibly break it down into a total number. But then the lower levels, you could represent it as a percentage. So, you know, Tam, you're assuming that's 100%. If you got every single potential client, then there's like, well, maybe we'll get 70 to 80% of that, and then maybe we'll get 30 or 40% of. The next level. You could do it that way without actually including dollar signs, but that's one option.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:49:18.775Z)

Yeah. And I agree with this is like one. That will need at some point. I just don't think it's urgent right now.

### You (2025-09-09T21:49:26.477Z)

Yeah. No, we're. I agree with mark. We're not to the point where that's going to be relevant yet.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:49:33.015Z)

We're selling the dream. Yeah. So to put added a slide about data partners, providers. This is not complete. This is just starting to get. I mean, Diane, I think you've probably done more research on this than I have at this point. But trying to. What was the name of that construction company we talked about that monitors pips and stuff? We should add them to the workflow. Yeah, well, Procore is on there. We're talking to mind click as well. They do. They track sustainable products and renovation. So my vision is. And I'm actually gonna do some discovery work with Procore over the next week to try to understand, like, how many hotel clients they have. And if we could create, like, a module that almost links where Procore leaves off and starts to grab in conjunction with MindQ, who's already doing this. Right. They're already tracking all the PIP costs because they need to identify the sustainable products that are being used in pips. And then that becomes like a kind of like almost like a agent, right? We're going into procore our agent and pulling up the information, and then we're setting a module that sits on top of it. If this is kind of making sense. But that helps the industry track the renovation costs and the rate groupings that we need.

### You (2025-09-09T21:50:56.317Z)

So, Drew, a couple things here. Realpage is all one word. P is a capital p. I also think netsuite is a capital S. I think on there, I'm pretty sure. But what bothers me is it's like, are we presenting these as actual partners? Are these potential partners? I mean, I don't want to put something like this in front of a client says, oh, here's We've got all these partners lined up where we.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:51:10.615Z)

Yeah, you're right. Why don't we call it Just Perspective, Data Partners? That's a good point.

### You (2025-09-09T21:51:29.357Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:51:33.895Z)

Prospect. Ive right.

### You (2025-09-09T21:51:34.797Z)

Yeah. Pro.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:51:37.495Z)

Here. Thanks.

### You (2025-09-09T21:51:39.917Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:51:42.775Z)

All right. Yeah. So I think we can. We can add to this. And as part of the discussion, we clarified that some of these are, you know, active discussions. Some of them are, you know, potential discussions. Right. So, Drew, I think Procore would go over to Workflow Automation. Right. Wouldn't that be that would go. And what. Yeah, that's. I mean, some of these, like Cherry, I was. They're. They're not really financial, so I don't know. I have to think about how to organize this perhaps a little bit better. True. Yeah. Procore Cherry Real page. Could be more flow automation or even third party data versus financial systems. Right. Like this is mostly operator data.

### You (2025-09-09T21:52:29.117Z)

Yeah. I see you've got cherry in both. I mean that. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:52:29.335Z)

Anyway. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So should really only be in one. But I think I started to move it and then I stopped. I forgot to remove it from here. But anyway, this is just, you know, to be further fleshed out.

### You (2025-09-09T21:52:41.277Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T21:52:44.775Z)

The team, obviously, each of us. And then this is kind of what I was getting at, sort of some sort of structure for product roadmap. Talking about, you know, the phase or timing of things. Product features. Cost component, you know, status we could add or remove. Pieces of this, but this is sort of a way that I thought was would be good to present this in a deck. I just gotta go back to Howard. What you put together? And maybe this is. You know, maybe it's POC MVP V1 or something like that, but, you know, we can. Obviously, product features are gonna be very high level as to what we put in here. Cause I want this to be minimal text. Very, very easy to use as a reference point for discussions and presentations. So can we lock down a goal? Because I know that Mark has a lot of thoughts about the DAC and Drew during a good job. Of capturing some of your thoughts and Mark's thoughts and putting this through the AI platform. Can we set a timeframe? Because I think I've given you guys everything. Like, that I've drained all creative energy and, like, the idea is, can you and Mark just take a shot at working together on what you wanna pull from what I gave you, what you guys want to include based on Mark's? Conversations. And can we set by, like, next Tuesday? Is that reasonable? Like a week from today that we have? And I'm less worried about the client. Piece. I mean, I'm more focused right now. We need pitch book so that we can start to go out and try to get a few more investors so that we can get the node on full time. So does that sound reasonable that by next Tuesday you and Mark can decide what you wanna include, what you don't, and then I think the last piece we really need is. I mean, before we reach out to anybody else, we need to get the budget and we need to have conversation about the budget, a roadmap. And the timeline. And also how we intend to charge for our service. Well, I'd make sure if we necessarily need to do that. Yet. Like, I don't think that goes go in here. I mean, we do need to know it, obviously, but for this, I think investors are gonna ask. This is a great idea. But they want to know, at least conceptually, how we think about charging. I mean, it's gonna be subject to change a hundred times. But I think that we need to at least be prepared to answer the question. If we say investor escap, we're charging, we say we don't know. That's sort of a weird response. Or we can at least have comparisons. Like, I can explain how hotel Bis charges. I know how our competitors charge. And you got that insight today from that other system. If I could also just suggest one thing here is I did spend a lot of time thinking about how we're gonna price the product. Because the industry is changing so much. Right. And so Howard put a lot of thought into it as well and he did a ton of research and senate around to the group. So like initially I put it in a four phase plan or four phase one is just the high end of SaaS based product right now because it's hotel, and it's complex. But then, too, as AI features are added, that there's like a big mark, there becomes a bigger markup on that for the AI. And Howard can speak to a bit about how the agents will work and the inability that we'll have to control some of the pricing. Or actually, then the second thing was T shirt pricing. Small groups, medium groups, institutional groups. So that that concept, just like Juniper Square, is in there. And then the fourth is that we're pricing on Aum when we become a full transaction management platform. But very little in true numbers because it's so in flux right now. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going back to look at your pricing. Slide. So, yeah, we put that in. Or I think, yes, I'll put that in. Can we. Can we look at what the study is together? Because, again, I do think that we. We should have something on that in here. Right, but something that really talks about numbers. We can talk about. How? Like actable profits or how we price single paying prices. Companies that you've talked with earlier. Right. Like, we can put in all those price. I think they're all. That's the high end of SaaS pricing. That's the first piece. And then the second piece, I think, is more like thinking about how a platform like Juniper Square prices. Which is small, medium and large. T shirt pricing. And then the third is what. What happens in the future. It's almost like the perplexity thing where you start with a $20 per month, right? And then before you know it, that is you become addicted, and then they move the price to $200 per month. And I think we're going to see that across a lot of platforms. And then the fourth becomes when five years from now, when we're a full transaction management platform, then we need to push into the AUM pricing, which is a little bit like vts, although VTS does it on square footage. But in concept, it's not. You know, we would be like a broker in some ways, right? Be charging. A percentage or something like that on the transaction volume. To get it away from per desk or per seat pricing. That could really limit our ability to grow revenue. Yeah. So I had a call today. I sat on a webinar. And it turned out that I was the only one to sign up for the webinar. So I had a direct discussion with the co founder of this platform called Simitra. And this was a asset management platform for multifamily. And they decided a year ago that they could pivot and also develop a product for hotels. So, you know, they want to position themselves as a premier asset management tool for the lodging industry and really do a lot of what we're talking about from both a analytic reporting perspective. Analytic and reporting perspective. And, you know, I can get into the specifics of the discussion, but what they're doing is they're charging one to two dollars. Per key per month. So for a. And then basically their sales pitch is that they should be. They should. They. They had the most amount of value. For portfolios of 1500 keys or more. So for 1500 unit or key Hotel? They'd be charging $1,500 a month. Or $18,000 a year. For a portfolio of, on average, four hotels. Who's behind it, Mark? Who are the people behind it? The two guys, you know, they started. They've been building the technologies since January of 21. And, you know, are they hotel people or they. It was a multifamily portfolio. But about 18 months ago. They decided. I spoke with Ross. They decided that this could also be very applicable for hotels. And they noticed that no one was really focusing on the hotel space. So now they're pretending to be hotel people. As well. So the idea also has similar pricing structure. They charge per unit to, you know, manage to use their platforms. To Morgan Properties. So, yeah, I think that is another pricing model we can look at as well. But they're doing the monthly analytics. And then they have this beautiful report that there are Linux go into. And that report is great for investor reporting or management company reporting or ownership reporting. And he showed me, you know, copies of their sort of face pages. It's really well done. It has a picture of the hotel on it. And then it has all the statistics. You know, going back from acquisition date. And it's highly customizable. So they have a team of customer service people that when they are on board a new company, They'll actually meet with them and sort of custom create technology that meets their specific needs. And they charge a consulting fee for that in addition to those fees that I just mentioned. Yeah, and this is a little bit more competitive with what ldis does. Albeit, again, a lot of overlap, but also and Mark was able to learn that their hotel customer right now. It's Magna Hospitality, which is owner operator. Was it Magnus? No, not Magna Midas. Mice in the Midwest. Yeah, but they're an owner operator. And one thing that occurred to me, actually, Mark, after we got off the phone, is that. Being an owner, being an operator. While there are owner operators that, you know, obviously bridge the two, they are fundamentally very different, because if you're an owner operator or an operator. You can say To Real page M3 QuickBooks whatever systems you have, you can say if this other system access to your API. And then because you're the paying customer, they will do it. Won't do it. He said that they use an ETL connection. They said that they. They had a lot of resistance. With API connections because of the push pull and they didn't want none of the management companies or the vendors wanted to be able to let them push back into their systems. So they said they have a lot of success. With an etl. I have no idea what that is, but I didn't want to transform that. Just basically just getting an Excel file. But he says they were automating through an ETL connection. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's. That's what Hotel BI has used as almost exclusively as well. Because operators still want to do APIs. Yeah. Interesting piece of information, but I think. Two facts to the deck. Yes, we can. We can put pricing, you know, this pricing slide in there. And some of this other stuff as well. Again. I think some of this will be less. I do want to see on the pricing though, that I feel like from a strategy, truly, and this isn't even in a pitch book, I feel like we should look at the six month window where we get beta clients and we get a beta client of each one, right? Appraiser, a lender, an owner, a broker, right? And we sit down and we really listen to what they need, right? And then we try to think about what our vision of for the. What the product is and is. Howard says that helps us decide the priority in which we roll out features. But then I think if their friends with us and they are not going to get locked into the long term pricing of this. Right? Because they're the very first to go. I think we ask them, like, what? Like, okay, how much would you pay for this? Right? Like, I think we have more pricing discovery work to do. Because, Mark, this system looks totally awesome. And I agree that it's a lot like what Drew does with hotel biz. But, like, our vision is a bit different than their vision, as is the fact that we're combined multifamily and hotel experienced companies. So our hopefully our access to people and the ability for us to maybe even make convincing, convincing cases on why they should even consider maybe changing the way they do things like operators and APIs. We might have a better shot at it than they do if we can paint a vision of something very different. And we know them. We know these people.

### You (2025-09-09T22:05:08.877Z)

So on the pricing. I think we'll need a separate meeting on that. I mean. The. Per key, per door. Pricing will work very well for the asset management, but I don't see how that could be applied to anything else in our product offering. But we could go with a per deal. So every deal that they create in InnVestAI is X number of dollars. And the reason I bring that up is over the last two or three years especially redIQ was getting significant amount of pushback from clients when the market dropped. And basically the bottom fell out of multifamily. We were processing about. 60% less rent rolls in the operating statements. But the clients were playing the same fixed price. And we lost clients. And ones that we didn't lose, they really push back. Like, why am I paying the same price now? When the bottoms out of the market. I'm not using your tool as I was back a couple years ago when things were on fire. So that is something that we'll have to seriously consider of. Kind of goes along with the T shirt sizing, but more precise, right?

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:06:44.615Z)

Let's just think strategically, right? Because, Howard, I totally. I understand that. Right. Like, and I actually like that idea that it's transaction volume based because that helps us move in five years to a transaction management system. But I think in our strategy, then what we need is to have some part of our revenue stream. And maybe this is focused on loan and loan servicing and that we price it affordably so that we can maintain a certain level of base revenue. If this is making sense, our lights on revenue, right?

### You (2025-09-09T22:07:19.517Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:07:20.695Z)

It support. Yeah, Base plots. And so maybe it's the loan servicers that are base revenue. And we pay and we price it very affordably. Just when we try to go for scale, just so we have that consistent base. Keep your lights on revenue. And then from there, almost. I'm talking like a revenue manager. Then from there. We can stack on the additional modules and have more. We won't feel as pressured about, you know, what we're charging. Does that make sense? Does that make sense?

### You (2025-09-09T22:07:52.157Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:07:52.295Z)

Yeah. Although, I mean, I think, you know, for the initial users, I mean, I think, you know, I understand. We need operating cash flow. Right? And that's going to come from the investors. But from a customer perspective. You know, it's probably more valuable for us to just get people using it and saying good things about it. Than getting a lot of revenue from them. Right. Because we just want to build momentum, we want to build users, and we want to use their name to get more business.

### You (2025-09-09T22:08:15.517Z)

Absolutely. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:08:19.815Z)

So, you know, even if we can raise a couple hundred thousand dollars through the Friends and Family Network, And finance our immediate growth. I think it's going to be less about getting revenue from the first three or four users. Yeah. And also, like, we want people to use it more and more from data perspective. The more, you know, they use more data we get and, you know, we can kind of find a use case for that.

### You (2025-09-09T22:08:46.877Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:08:47.895Z)

Yeah. We can. So let's. We can come back to this. I just put a note, you know, a new line here. Talk about. But I do like the idea of maybe just instead of talking about what we're gonna charge. Maybe summarizing what our top five or six competitors are charging. And just kind of leaving it there and saying that we're gonna use these as benchmarks. And as we grow, we're kind of slide into our own structure. It just kind of sets. The mood for pricing without having to specifically say, well, we're charge. Yeah. Or even. Yeah, just talking about potential frameworks. Without having this discrete numbers. Yeah, I'll add that in. Because, I mean, when we're fully built, I mean, we're. We're gonna be taking the place of four or five different vendors. That each of these companies have. So in theory, we should be able to charge multiple of what any of our competitors are charging for just one service.

### You (2025-09-09T22:09:40.397Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:09:45.735Z)

Can we just leave it though? Drew and Mark, whatever. Just make sure you touch base with Howard, because, like, we want a really good first draft of this investor pitch deck by next Tuesday. And so, in the interim, if you have ideas, youth, the three of you guys talk, right? I may be less available than I usually am, but. Just make sure that, like, he's. Is that all right? Just. I mean, be. Because he's the product manager, and so I just wanna make sure that his view is included in whatever we put on that slide. Yeah. No, again. I mean, what? Drew just walked through. That is a large part Know kind of how we see that initial deck. Just trying to keep it simple and tell the story. But, you know, obviously, Howard, we want your input, and feel free to edit as you see.

### You (2025-09-09T22:10:35.197Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:10:35.415Z)

You see fit.

### You (2025-09-09T22:10:36.397Z)

Appreciate that. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:10:38.375Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-09T22:10:38.957Z)

One of the things I'm going to be doing. I just made a note to myself is. I think transactional pricing is probably going to be one of the key features, but I don't know what the velocity is in the hotel. So I'll do some research on how many transactions take place.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:10:55.335Z)

Eah. Oh, I have that. I have some of that I can shoot it over to. In fact, I think it's already there, but I'll just reshoot it to you. And then the person. And then Mark has the best relationship, Lesser and Wei's tracks all of that. And so we're sitting at a place in history where peak volume was 2015 and it was 35. Bill, in the US in hotels. Last year was 14.5. And so there is. This is what I think is so important about our product. Is. There is, like, this backlog of transaction activity that has to pull through the system. Right. We've almost hit the wall when it comes to how long can the prior investors hold on. But I'll shoot you what I have. And then again, I get a report every quarter from LW about all the transactions that occurred in the industry. But again, I just wonder, I mean, do we think that we're going to be able to. Get fees commensurate with the size of the deal or just the number of deals? I think just a number of deals. That's what I know. I think when we go to like five years out, just think five, we want to be on the aum. We want to be like how a broker price is. Because in some way. But what we're going to need to do to affect that kind of pricing is be truly integrated. Like, being able to bring their legal workflows in, being able to breathe, bring their PIP workflows in. Like, we're going to have to be so valuable to them that we almost are able to switch. That's eventually. I think that's eventually.

### You (2025-09-09T22:12:05.357Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:12:41.895Z)

But isn't that what I mean? Like, this is a. This isn't. I mean, we're already. In my mind, we have a year of just beta product and trying to get this launched, and then we had two years of trying to get to two and a half to three and a half million, which then. Takes us from pre seed to series A. And once we're in series A, then I feel like we'll have, like, the real momentum to try to grow. But initially, yes, per deal. I mean, it's per deal. I agree with that, but I don't think we need. I don't want anyone to think we're going to lock that in in perpetuity. Because I really feel like we should be going for a true percentage of Aum eventually. Yeah, yeah. We can. We can come back to all of this.

### You (2025-09-09T22:13:31.917Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:13:32.215Z)

But I have a line right now for pricing. All right, so I'll finish up. Adding a few things to this outline, Howard. I'll send it to you. Give it, give it a review. But really, one thing that's going to be critical is having the budget and the roadmap and the timeline all synced up, which in this slide here, which, you know, we can't do until we have the budget laid out and have a conversation about that, but let's pull up for a second and talk big picture. So we have a six. I'll call it a six month budget, right? And Howard and Vinod have given the monthly subscription cost when you start to include owner draw and AI resources and a little bit of Carrie's time and a little bit of travel. That really gets us to 500 to 500 to 550k pretty easily for six months. Then all the research I have done on like what you need for another two years of pre seed funding would get us to like a four to four and a half million total precede raise over three years. And then at the three year mark is when we go for Series A. But why that four to four and a half million dollars is important. Is because some companies will look at that and say that represents 12 to 15% of the future value of your company. And so you guys, you know, told us and told me you wanted to, like, really be careful about valuation discussions, right? But I feel like that when someone that is a. That is a number, people are gonna wanna understand, and then they'll do that same math in their head. Yeah, but again, though, that's. That's like. We're not gonna have that conversation with anybody in the next six months. I don't know, though, how you don't do that, because we're gonna have discussions about. I just don't know how you do that. They're gonna want to talk about the future value of the company. Yes. And I've had those conversations with dozens of companies. And they're like, basically, when you have revenue to justify that, Asking for 4 million and saying is indicative of a valuation that is 20% of a company or 10% of a company. It's basically that might determine how much you ask for and what the valuation is. But the investor is going to look at revenue. Well, let's just play this down the road. So, Mark say you go to Dan Lesser and he say, dan, you present the pitch and you say LARC is a perfect fit, right? Just 7500K, something like that. What does Dan say to you as far as what he's getting for that 75k to 100k? He's getting. He's buying at the beginning of this journey. I mean, we just. What percentage of the company does he own? Well, that's the whole concept behind the safe, right? We're not valuing any percentage. I don't know. I think that's going to be a harder conversation. I mean, I think people may want to have a sense of if they're investing 100k. How much they own of it, but it's an impossible calculation at this point. Yeah, you are right, Diane, that people would love to have that, and it's just too difficult. Too far apart. Like the value of something that doesn't exist in the eyes of those that are creating it is never going to be the same as those that are on the outside looking in. Skeptically at dozens of these companies. I just want to say why I think we should do this. So say Dan, you're like, well, it's too early to tell, right? And Dan says, well, no, I'm 75k to 100k. I should own 10% of this company. Like his vision of how much revenue this can produce and our vision, or at least my vision of how much revenue this can produce. Could be vastly different. And therefore he may be thinking he owns a much bigger share of this company than he really does. Because he only is going to own. And I believe this in my heart of soul. I mean, I wouldn't spend years of my life and be in the situation I'm in if I didn't believe it. We will reach 100 million in ARR and 5, 7 years. But I think that people will be skeptical and then we could end up that they think that they own just a much bigger part of the company than they really. The only people who are going to be investing in this company at this point believe we're creating the future, and they want to be part of it. And they're basically just taking a home certificate. There's absolutely, positively no way to value this company today. And they might believe that everything, as Mark said, they're buying into thinking that what they think could be or will be the future of how transactions are managed in the industry. Whether that's going to generate 10 million, 100 million, 500 million is impossible to say. And I don't even know that that matters to those people that we're going to be asking right now. Okay, this is what's most important to me, please, is that we have a finished investor pitched deck.

### You (2025-09-09T22:18:57.117Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:19:03.975Z)

In a very short period of time that we can go start to people, go start talking to people, because we're going to crumble pretty soon. I'm not going to fight on principle. You guys go take it. And if you don't want to say, if you don't want to say it's $4 million over the first three years, and you just want to say it's 500 to 550k, perfect. Let's just go get the finish. Investor pitch back, please. Confer with Howard on any pricing decisions. Unless. Just get this locked down, because we have to get out there and start figuring out how we're going to fund this. And I don't want to stand on my work. I put a lot of effort and time into it, but at the same time, I just want to move this forward at this point. So you guys confer with Howard on the pricing, please get the investor pitch deck. The customer pitch deck, I realize, will be very similar, but let's just go and push through and get this done. Yeah. Do you want to just send me the budget that you have right now and then I can have. Yeah, I need a little bit more time to work on it, and I don't have that time tomorrow, but I'll have it Thursday morning. All right.

### You (2025-09-09T22:20:26.317Z)

Before we move on. We had discussion last week about the cost. We don't have a way of determining a cost at this point. So.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:20:39.895Z)

Pastor blett.

### You (2025-09-09T22:20:40.637Z)

The cost of the features like you have in that slide.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:20:43.655Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2025-09-09T22:20:44.717Z)

So I don't think we need to even have cost in there. We're looking at what phase you're in. What features are included in those Phase S and what status of the phase.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:20:57.575Z)

This is more about. This is for presentation purposes about. More about Runway, right? So 15,000 was sort of the Runway we set for this three month period. What's the Runway for this three month period, and what does that entail? Maybe it's POC MVP V1, V2. But I think it would be more appealing to those that are going to be speaking with if we say, Here are the, you know, three, four big picture, very big picture, high level things that are going to be in this bucket here. The next three, four, five things in here. Right? So there's so many separate from what we.

### You (2025-09-09T22:21:37.277Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:21:38.055Z)

Talk about internally.

### You (2025-09-09T22:21:39.277Z)

I get that. And that's fine. That's easy to do. That's exactly what I had in mind. But the cost row, we need to remove that. I can't give you a cost for what it's going to cost to build the mvp.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:21:54.695Z)

But we know that. We think that between now and March will incur 400 to 500k in costs. Right. We just can't tie that exactly to do that. But that is something that investors are going to want to know what they're going to want to know.

### You (2025-09-09T22:22:00.957Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:22:10.215Z)

Is what our burn rate is. Yeah, and how much capital are we going to need? Because they want to make sure they're less concerned about the future projections. Because they know that whatever we give them is because we have no way of knowing. But they're going to want to know how much money we think we're going to burn through at six month intervals. Because they give us 100,000. They want to make sure we're going to be able to survive. That is something that they are going to focus on. Yeah. And so that's great. So, Drew, where you have between October and December and January and March, and you just put 250 and 500k, right? Combined those two per. Because we're already through September. I mean, it's September 9th, right? By the time we actually have conversations, it's going to be October. So those two arrows equals 550k and we can just. I can give you. I am not sure I can break it out. In the periods that you're talking about, October to December through January through March. But I think a six month burn rate is reasonable for us just to be look at our five months. We should break it out by month because five of us are going to need to have conversations about how much we're spending per month. And it sounds like most of the costs are fixed. They are labor. Founder pay subscriptions. There's variability based on. The notice said that there's variability based on utilization of software, database, whatnot for AI features. Right. Like, there will be variable cost there, but a lot of it is fixed. And so we need to know the run rate by month and then be able to say, okay. Layer that against the product roadmap, and then we could talk about, you know. Okay, like, I mean, how much money do we need to raise? Obviously. All right, Grace, Toa. You know what? This is what I'll do. I will just finish the spreadsheet that Howard and Vinod and I did. We looked at it in for a six month period. I'll shoot it to you, you can look at it and then you and Mark can decide how you want to allocate it between these three months. Because, honest to God, it's flipped. It's the opposite. It's like we're almost. Looking at. Once we get the third investor and the fourth investor, what's the next highest priority on our list? Right, so first highest priority is get the node off his job so he can spend full time on this. Second highest priority. Whether you look at that forward or backwards doesn't matter. It's the same conversation. It's just not monthly, it's incremental. It's like when we get an investor in November, then we say, okay, this money needs to be allocated to the highest priority. And then when we get another investor in January, we say, this money needs to be allocated to the second highest priority. And what I am saying is that these priorities are one, the node getting off his job. So he'll. Because we're bottlenecking and we need that. Right. Second is Howard and I need money to live off of. We cannot freaking pay our bills. And third, it is. We need some marketing assistance. And in there is $560 a month in subscription fees. Right. Plus the engineering costs. But we also have to look at. We're going to need AI engineering and product management, cost, but those probably don't need to come until call February or March. So it's really not. I mean, you break it out how you want to because honestly, it's complete bullshit. It's just when we start to get investors. We know between now and March, we need about 500 to 550k. And when they start to come in, then we say, okay, this has to go to the highest priority feature that gives us our people, a person that gives us the most ri. There's four minutes away. I have an interesting demo to show. You, so whenever, say, let me know. Oh, yeah. Okay. We can. We can. Why are we just talking about till March? Oh, that's my point. I've talked about it before. Million dollars to get us through to Series A, right? We need to show that whole journey. Yeah, we can show. You guys were the ones that just said you didn't want to show $4 million. Did I not hear that? Or maybe I don't think anyone said that at all. I did say that. It doesn't make sense just to say we need $4 million now, because we don't. We need 560. I know, but, guys. We have to show if an investor is putting in 75,000 or 100, they want to make sure that there's a path. To success. And they're going to want to see what we're going to need in total capital. To bring this to a product that could start really generating some revenue. Then they're less concerned about what that revenue is. But they want to know, like, if they're putting in 75 now, how much do we think it's going to take? To get to a completed product. And they're going to want to understand how we're going to get there. But our product will truly never be completed. It's going to grow and grow and grow. Right? But there's a. There's a base. There's a base product. Is a base product. That needs to be able to do all the things that we say it's going to do. And they're going to and pipeline management piece of it. Is we finish at the end of March. And we need 500 to 500k to get there. Okay, but our company is called InnVestAI, so they want to know. And, Diana, you're getting frustrated, but I don't know why. Okay, but I'm just. I'm just. I'm telling you how it is. You don't like my answer, but I'm telling you how it works. And I'm telling you how it is. And you don't like my answer either, right? You're talking about it from a personal perspective. I'm talking about it how it works. Diane. Can I finish my thought, please? Because. This is not productive. I could just hang up otherwise. Okay? I've done this before. I know how capital raising works. And I know what investors need. I know you have personal needs. But your personal needs can impact the process. The process did the process. That that's why we're having issues here. Like, I appreciate your concerns. But there's still a process, and investors are not going to modify the process because of our personal interests. I just. I'm sorry. I wish there was another way. I have to say back to you. I've listened to you in your entirety, right in this. In that. In that pitch deck I gave you. I gave what I think is the process. And so I did that. You guys choose to use it, you choose. You don't want to use it. Mark, you've got the better relations in this industry. And so at this point, let's just shut down discussions of the pitch book. You guys go put together what you want to put together and come back and talk to us on Tuesday. And please, let's switch over to the last few minutes. If you can't even owe. We have something positive to look at from a demo perspective. Okay? I agree. Yeah, let's get into a demo part here. So let me share my screen real quick. This one. Okay, so I'm gonna start. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Yes. Okay, I'm gonna start by creating a deal here. And I'm gonna upload this document. So, let's see. So I've already put some information there. Go to Next Property Details. Let's say full service. We can go with any number here. So, Howard, the comment you had made that we should be able to create the deal without uploading the document. So that is already done here, so which is great. And then I'll drag the document here and put the head down here. I'll choose as financial document and I'll create on dev environment. It is little slow but it's gonna be much better on the production environment. And then I'll show you the extracted data for comparison as it's not mapping to the database right now, but I'll show you the other functionality that I was going to show. I think we made a lot of good progress. In last few days. And that's what I'm excited about. So if I show you the extracted data, And then, you know, we can do some comparison here. I'm showing you from my. Development environment here. Let me scroll down a bit. Okay, so we can compare the data here. Let's see what I got. Let's see. Available rounds. Let's try to find this one first. Then I look for value. That's gonna be a lot. One second. Let me look for something else. Let's look. What? This one? Total rep. Air1. Okay. Not a bit. Okay. All right, so we have the total rep bars here. Let's compare. So this is our entire row. I think the last value is 989-0-42. So which is good? And the first one is 9:30 to 1 058. Yeah, that's all about it. So I think a lot of values are getting extracted correctly. There are few values which are not. In this one would be supporting the more complex financial this is comparatively simpler. This has, like, two headers here and one, you know, these keys and then the numbers. Embrace one is most complex that are like three, four headers, and then other keys here in center. And that's what's been challenging, but I think we made good progress in that one as well.

### You (2025-09-09T22:32:40.397Z)

No, that looks.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:32:40.455Z)

So that is there? Yeah.

### You (2025-09-09T22:32:41.997Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:32:43.415Z)

So the. I mean, one of the next pieces will be to get the data from the extract. Map to the corresponding location on the pro forma. Output database first. And once that is done, we'll map that across the application right here, right where you see 0, 0, right now. That's where it is gonna map. But we are still able to, you know, insert some of the values, not all. So this is the piece I'm most exciting about, and I think you'll be as well. So we kind of worked on this AI generating summary here. Right. So this will basically compare the data readiness. We have 60% score here because we are able to insert only few fields and not all. So you'll see what is missing here right now. Now, I'll go here and I'll kind of click on generate the summary here. Try to do some work. Go through all that. This is not there right now. Is this, you know, do you think is this to the point where it would be useful for us to do a more in depth, and by us, I mean just probably me to start with, to do a more in depth. Review. Of everything. Yeah, unless we are able to put the data correctly in database, I don't think we can. We should really start testing it. But why don't we. Protecting. I just meant, like, yeah, you can all know, like, you can always go here. And, you know, play around. Anyone can go here, log in with your Google account, and, you know, just start playing around. So I created on that generatei summary, and the summary is kind of generated here that different buttons here. This also tells us the cost of generating that summary, which is this one. Then I'll click on the view. Once I click on the view, this is the summary we get and this is how it summarize it might, you know, choose some better approach to show these data in bullet points. Or in a better ux manner. So property overview this one. And then since we have limited data, these other tabs are not there. But once we update, these all will have values as well. And then you can always copy all the data. If you do copy all, you can paste the USA in word or do you wanted to copy that? Let's say. And where's the. Where's the. Like the information coming from, like that property? Prop. The information is the one we are expecting and putting in the database. So we aggregate that data. Pass it to our model. Has the chain capabilities. And that basically generates the data. This all happens within our AWS infrastructure node. Data goes outside. So it's completely private and secure.

### You (2025-09-09T22:36:00.797Z)

Which is a huge selling point.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:36:03.655Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-09T22:36:05.677Z)

So neither. When Vinod showed this to me on Monday, I was very excited. It may not look like it, but that's a lot of work that went into getting us to this point, and I was not expecting the progress bars and everything else. So if we're here on September 9th, Mark, I know you're going to be at a conference on October six. We will have something that is like this, that is very. It will be ready to show.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:36:44.935Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-09T22:36:45.117Z)

You may not be able to go from A to Z through the entire model, but you'll be able to process a document. You'll be able to get. You can have most of that information in there. You'll be able to generate a summary like this. Now, when we go live in production, we're not going to show the cost on that line. But you know this costs 1.3 cents to generate this, right? We would probably charge a buck. Right, but the fact that we can monitor that, and we can, we know what the cost is. This kind of circles back to our pricing conversation where, you know, we will have, like, a base cost. And then when we get into the AI Features, That'll be, you know, charge per report or whatever. We will know exactly what the cost is. To generate each one of those items so that, you know, they would be billed accordingly. Because I was telling Diane in the call yesterday, I read, I read an article over the weekend about all of these products, like the no code tools that they charge 20 bucks a month. But now, because OpenAI anthropic, they come up with these new models. That are just way more expensive. So they're charging. I told Diane one of them was a case study where one of the companies. It didn't mention the name of the company. Were, like, charging 20 bucks or, excuse me, 200 bucks for, like, this ultimate tier. In one month, their expense was $3,000. So they're losing 2800 bucks a month on that fixed subscription fee. You have to have the ability to charge users. By what they consume. So this is huge.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:38:40.215Z)

Howard. So let's quickly complete this and then we can discuss this for the so download video basically generates a PDF of this entire report. So you can always download the open in PDF and you'll have that report here. We can definitely format it better, but this is what we have right now. So that is that. I'll close that one. So this always gets saved here. So anytime you generated that summary, it is saved here. And even if you come anytime in future, this generated summary will be here. You can regenerate that will add one more summary. On top of that, suppose you have uploaded new data, so you can always regenerate it. And then you'll have two summaries listed there. Real quick just because I want to make sure I understand that the PNL you submitted was just it's not related to the loc ation and address and that investment summary, like what it says in there, as far as like. Plant based office space and whatnot. Right, like that. That's not. That was just. Right. Like I. What I wanted to understand is because it is. This all is really impressive and I think exactly what. We're looking for. I just wanted to note, is it to the point where the actual text in there is related to something, or is this just, like, sample text? No, this is not a sample tag. This is generated by the model itself. So there's no sample test from mock data in this one. Okay. And. But so the numbers. Because the deal wasn't totally filled out yet. Yeah, this is wrong number. This. This one is. And you know, we still need to more testing on this. We can, you know, put guardrails and all that. This like a bus draft out right now. And I think the address that was course that was in there was not the same as the one for the actual shell, so it's gonna be okay. Cool. That's what I was worrying about. That was just my address. So that is the one great progress we made in a couple of last days. The other one is the valuation. So we already have the performa. We are working on mapping the data, but we have also created the valuation model here. So, you know, whatever we have in poc, we have here. We are kind of, you know, working to improve this. But we made good progress on the valuation part as well.

### You (2025-09-09T22:41:17.837Z)

Yeah, looks great.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:41:19.895Z)

Thank you. Yeah, sorry, Howard. Yeah, you can continue with that.

### You (2025-09-09T22:41:26.477Z)

No, I just really wanted to point out to the team that what you guys have already accomplished is huge. For not just even just filling in the blanks in the model, but the way that we can measure the usage and everything else goes. Way out beyond just the model itself, so.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:41:50.855Z)

And I mean the infrastructure we have now, we can do much more agile ticki or whatever you want to do rag or, you know, whatever use case. We have that capabilities. Also. Yeah, Howard and I. And I think Vinod, you should be on this invite. For tomorrow. To talk about. No, you're not. Let me add you, if you're able to join the note. But we're gonna talk about larc. The LARC data. Which is fairly simple. Data set. That would feed into one, you know, that market section of the pro forma. So it just shouldn't require any AI. It should be a straight ETL to extract data from that, because it'll be. It'll be a fixed, structured file. Like a flat file. Yeah, it is definitely straight. I just didn't want to take more because RMVP is already not completed. So that's why I haven't taken that. Yeah, no, that's fine. This is. Howard is gonna make the documentation first, and then we'll get to. Then you can get to putting it into the actual. Product.

### You (2025-09-09T22:43:00.157Z)

Mark. I registered for that larc. Industry Outlook on Thursday. Thanks for long.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:43:06.055Z)

Oh, good.

### You (2025-09-09T22:43:09.117Z)

I need to get very familiar with very fast.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:43:13.335Z)

Yeah. Okay. Vinod, thank you so much for your team's progress over the last week. It's incredibly exciting. Yeah. I mean, and I know we all need to jump off. I just want a reminder that on Thursday, for the first half hour of this call, We're actually gonna jump on a demo for that interactive Deck product that I've been talking about. So just remember that they're not joining our call. We're joining, and you guys should all have the invite on your calendar. But we're joining a call that they have set up so they can walk us through their product. And what it looks like. All right. Have a great night, everyone. Talk to you on Thursday.

### You (2025-09-09T22:43:56.077Z)

All right. Thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-09T22:43:57.095Z)

Thanks, everyone.
