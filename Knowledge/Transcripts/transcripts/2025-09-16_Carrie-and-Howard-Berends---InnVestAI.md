# Transcript for: Carrie and Howard Berends - InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:08.619Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:10.540Z)

Good afternoon. How are you?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:13.819Z)

Can you hear me?

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:14.700Z)

Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:16.299Z)

I can't hear you.

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:26.940Z)

Can you hear me at all?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:29.419Z)

I see your mouth moving, but I can't hear you.

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:33.180Z)

That's very. Let me check. I don't see anything wrong.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:48.699Z)

Oh, I can hear you now.

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:49.980Z)

Really? Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:16:51.259Z)

Yeah. That's so weird.

### You (2025-09-16T19:16:52.620Z)

Yeah, I was going to say I didn't see anything wrong. Everything. I was going to log off and log back in just to see if I had. To reboot something. But anyway, how are you?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:17:04.219Z)

Good. Very good. Thanks. I'm doing well. SF is getting more so. It's nice. We rarely get this weather. How about you?

### You (2025-09-16T19:17:16.540Z)

Doing very good. Doing good. Productive weekend. So let me see.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:17:24.299Z)

What did you do?

### You (2025-09-16T19:17:28.300Z)

Spent a lot of time at the cottage on my own. To just kind of get caught up on stuff. So let me see here.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:17:45.899Z)

Yeah, I mean, I can recap. Kind of like the email I sent over as well, if that helps.

### You (2025-09-16T19:17:52.780Z)

Yeah, actually. I'm sorry. I was kind of going through here. My files. I know. Maybe I didn't download the file. Maybe I left it attached to your email. I was going to open up that PowerPoint that you sent, but anyway, I've got your email here in front of me. I can just pop it open again.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:18:13.659Z)

Is the PowerPoint working? Or is it? If it's not, I can. Yes.

### You (2025-09-16T19:18:17.660Z)

It's working. Yeah, it's just about, what, seven logos, I think.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:18:19.019Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T19:18:22.620Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:18:23.499Z)

There are seven logo.

### You (2025-09-16T19:18:26.060Z)

Conversation. That.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:18:27.579Z)

We've had with Diane and you sent with the color in to make.

### You (2025-09-16T19:18:35.020Z)

You try to encourage.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:18:45.579Z)

I just wanted to ask if there were any. Logo feedback that you guys have. Because I know this is an iteration process, and I know you guys are looking to move along, I finalize on a logo quickly. I don't know. Maybe in the next week or so before Mark heads out to Phoenix for the lodging conference. Right. And then I have to get the website up and running.

### You (2025-09-16T19:19:14.940Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:19:19.259Z)

As the one pager. So there's lots to discuss, I guess. All of the things I just mentioned. What's most pressing for you guys that you guys want me to work on first? Is it the website? The one pager? A pitch deck? I know.

### You (2025-09-16T19:19:46.060Z)

It will probably still be the logo in the one pager.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:19:49.819Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:19:52.460Z)

They're still working on the pitch deck. That probably is going to be something that they'll just send to you to. Review and provide some feedback. At least. For what Mark takes with him to the conference in Phoenix. Afterwards. We'll probably need more help. We had a little confusion. Let's put it that way. Diane created a pitch deck, and Mark and Drew created a pitch deck, and now there's a lot going back and forth as to which pitch deck they use. I pointed out the fact we actually need two pitch decks. We need one for investors and then another pitch deck or sales deck for potential clients. And both of their decks. Kind of have both, right? In fact. Or Drew even said he was trying to create a one size fits all deck in that they could take out slides depending on who they're meeting with. Right. So I don't know. I don't know that that's the way to go. But anyway, that's something we need to work on. But the priority will be getting things ready for Mark. So the one pager and then settling on a logo. So I did send the PowerPoint around over the weekend and we have our weekly meeting today at 5:30 our time. So that's when we'll discuss if there's anything. Personally, I like the third as the building because I think that incorporates a lot of what we wanted. I like the aspect of the building in it. I know Diane wanted to have some type of a circular feature in there to indicate the lifestyle. The only thing I would think of is it's kind of monotone. So maybe if we could come up with a couple of options that are a little bit more colorful, like, you know, your very first one, the vest, is in a different color. So maybe if we did something along that line, Yeah, but that's just my opinion. I have not yet even had an opportunity to speak with anybody, because I was thinking, like, number six, you've got. The AI is a different color. And I sent you the logo that we've got everybody really kind of likes. More or less. We just want to make sure that we can see if there is something we can come up that we like a little bit better.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:22:56.299Z)

The sample logos that you meant the two sample logos.

### You (2025-09-16T19:22:58.460Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:23:00.619Z)

Okay. So you. Is it the colors that you guys like for those two?

### You (2025-09-16T19:23:10.300Z)

It's a little bit more colorful. So the one that has the four vertical lines that go up and then has he invest. That's the one that we're using on our website, or one that's very, very similar to it. And then the other one is one that we put together, but after the website was put up. And that one I kind of like because it incorporates a building into the design, but it's very similar to that. I think that's why I'm personally kind of drawn towards number three, because it's kind of similar to, you know, having that building incorporated.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:23:52.219Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T19:23:53.740Z)

Even. Like slide number five. You know, that's got some color in it. It's misspelled. We need another N in there somewhere. And it has a building, but the building is more of a house. Right. It's got a chimney on it, and it looks to be smaller, so, you know, incorporating something like that. Is. You know, something that would be. Kind of along the lines of my personal opinion, but again, we for other people that need to weigh in this afternoon, so.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:24:34.699Z)

I was just playing around with it to see, like, you guys would like. And definitely this is an iteration process with the logo. I also notice, I don't know if you guys are open to it, but I noticed a lot of companies that have like, AI, they would be like, open, there'll be like ad manage AI and that would be like, people can directly go to their website if it's AI in that sense, I don't want to incorporate that period before AI even as well.

### You (2025-09-16T19:25:02.700Z)

Yeah. No. Well, that is something that, you know, Diane had gone out. And nailed the InnVestAI Dotcom domain. And then after we had purchased the domain and after the node had already put up the initial website, I brought that up. It's like, why didn't we try to get the InnVestAI. And I think Diane just kind of like. Well, I didn't really know that that was an option. So we went out and we do have the InnVestAI domain now.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:25:53.499Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:25:54.380Z)

And that's one that personally I would prefer to use. We would. You know, since we haven't gone live or anything, it wouldn't be a difficult to migrate from dot com to the AI. The thing is, the emails are all set up, you know, with the dot com, and they're expensive. I. I think. I don't think Diane or anybody else wants to put the the expense of purchasing another Microsoft package with the AI for the email. On their own credit card. So I think that's something that we can certainly bring up when we get our first investor. I mean, it's not huge amount of money, but, you know, Diane, you know, I don't know if you. If I've told you this, but her husband's been out of work for a couple years. And she has also been trying to do some consulting work, and she's gotten a few gigs here and there, but essentially they don't have any income. You know, I don't have any income, but my wife works, so it's not quite the same situation. Larc and Drew both have income, as does Vinod. So, yeah, I certainly can't ask Diane to cover an expense like that. Right now, we don't want to have her cover any expense. All right, so let's start taking number three and trying some different colors. Maybe in the InnVestAI, maybe taking a look at something similar to what we already have. Kind of breaking it up. Whether we use three colors for the invest in AI or whether we use two colors like the first one where you've got vest in a different color. Let's take a look some of the other options. And same thing with the logo that I sent that has the building over the Invest logo. Let's add that in. Feel free to make any modifications that you like. Or if you want to add that in, add another one or two options to that as well. That would be fine.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:28:24.299Z)

Okay, sounds good. I haven't had the chance to look over the two docks you sent me yet, but I will. And if I do, I'll email you or I'll ping you on LinkedIn if I have any questions.

### You (2025-09-16T19:28:37.980Z)

Yeah, it's not urgent. We had talked about Personas. And so, you know, we have a pretty thorough Persona documentation. That was one of them that I sent to you. The other one is one of the original documents that we put together. Just high level overview of InnVestAI and the products that we're putting together that, you know, something you can read over at your leisure. There's nothing. I don't. I don't know that any of that would actually help with what you're working on right now.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:29:10.939Z)

Okay? I did have two questions, I guess. One. The first one was, what platform are you guys using to run the domain for the website?

### You (2025-09-16T19:29:20.780Z)

Aws.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:29:23.179Z)

Okay. And then for the one pager, is there examples like, is Mark. Am I expecting Mark to share that? Information.

### You (2025-09-16T19:29:33.260Z)

Yeah, yeah, I'll prompt them in today's call.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:29:37.659Z)

Okay. And is the one. You're going to be towards. Kind of like I'm catering it towards the sales folks versus the investment folks or both.

### You (2025-09-16T19:29:48.780Z)

No, it will be potential clients, I think. I don't think he's really going to this conference.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:29:49.899Z)

Because.

### You (2025-09-16T19:29:59.020Z)

Trying to get people to write checks. As an investor. Maybe he is. I don't know. So that's something that. Did you guys ever settle on a time. To. To meet.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:30:16.219Z)

No, not yet.

### You (2025-09-16T19:30:16.780Z)

Okay? All right, so I've got three things I need to bring up in today's call.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:30:26.379Z)

Double check if I have as email.

### You (2025-09-16T19:30:29.500Z)

Yeah. He doesn't use his InnVestAI.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:30:40.779Z)

Oh, is it mark?

### You (2025-09-16T19:30:44.300Z)

Yeah. Intrinsic capital.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:30:44.459Z)

Intrin. Okay, okay.

### You (2025-09-16T19:30:48.460Z)

Yeah, if you want to just shoot him a quick email and kind of remind him, and then I'll bring it up in the call. You know, we tag team and see if we can get him to respond.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:31:05.019Z)

Sorry. Is this going to be a reoccurring call with Mark, or is it just, like. Just like, kind of information sharing? Call.

### You (2025-09-16T19:31:14.300Z)

The call today.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:31:16.379Z)

Or the one for me to set up with Park.

### You (2025-09-16T19:31:18.140Z)

Yeah, either one. We talked about setting up a recurring call, but I think Mark really is. His soul role with the team is to raise money. Which is why I'm not positive what his one pager needs to include. Because if you truly is trying to raise money, Then, you know, that's a totally different one, pager than if he was trying to drum up business. But Drew is really kind of. His role is really kind of more the chief operating officer, and that would probably be more in line with who, you know, would work with the marketing. And I think he's kind of really kind of doing most of the work on the pitch decks right now. He's working with Mark, but I would say he's probably done 70 or 80% of the work. So I don't know. Maybe we don't need to set up a recurring call with. With Mark. Maybe after we put together the one pager and the logo, maybe the most appropriate would be to get with Drew. And he's down. In. Not Irvine, but somewhere down there in la. Brentwood, maybe. Anyway, Same time zone as you.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:33:01.179Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:33:01.660Z)

So that might work out better anyway.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:33:05.899Z)

Okay. And then for the one page R for your call today, can you also provide some examples from some of the industries that some of the conferences that they went to so I can emulate some of the designs or like, which is what resonated in some of those conversations, because I've never been. So I.

### You (2025-09-16T19:33:27.900Z)

Yeah, I can ask if he's got anything. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:33:31.659Z)

Yeah, that would be great if you can turn over some examples and as well as, like, any of the, like, buzzword y terminology that, like, you guys want me to put on the one pager, like, any, any product feature that you want me to call out in the one pager as well, that would be really helpful.

### You (2025-09-16T19:33:50.540Z)

Yeah, and they're gonna depend on the audience. So we need to determine if he's looking, if he's gonna be meeting with the potential investors or if he's gonna be meeting with potential clients. We need to have investors before clients. Anyway, I hope he's gonna be talking more to the investor group. Let's see if we can get this on.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:34:16.779Z)

Okay. And another question I had was, like, I guess. I was curious, like, about the website. Like, why don't you guys want to work on it some more? Because wouldn't they want, like, investors or even clients? Wouldn't they want to see that as, like, brand recognition, trust?

### You (2025-09-16T19:34:37.980Z)

Yeah, we absolutely do wanna work on it. But the priority as of this next week or so has to be the 1 page in the logo.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:34:48.779Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:34:49.500Z)

Yeah, no, we definitely do need to have the website. Improved. Right now, it's just bare bones. Essentially just mentioning the name. I mean, it doesn't have anything with biographies or anything, which. Is partially intentional because since there is nobody in this space, But it wouldn't be that difficult for some of the existing companies out there, like Archer and some of the other ones. That were competitors with Redi q.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:35:29.259Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T19:35:30.060Z)

They could develop a model. So we're not exactly stealth, but we're not ready to make any big splash in the market yet until we're. Until we actually have some beta clients. And maybe even another client. So we're intentionally kind of keeping it low key.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:35:50.379Z)

Oh, I see. Okay, gotcha. Okay? Okay? I think in terms of all the housekeeping, I think we shared everything we need in terms of, like the one pager revising the logos and of course, provide the feedback. To me from the team of what they like, and I can just revise it some more. I can try to. Or I guess I can try to do it midweek, but it'll be a little tough for me.

### You (2025-09-16T19:36:25.900Z)

Let me ask you this. We meet every Tuesday and Thursday at 5:30 Eastern. So is there any possibility. Not for long. I mean, anytime between 1:30 and 2 on Thursday, your time.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:36:43.819Z)

130 and 2. Let me. Double check. On Thursday, you said.

### You (2025-09-16T19:36:51.100Z)

Yeah. Tuesdays we generally go easily an hour and a half. Thursday is usually just a quick catch up on what we've done over the week and what we're playing together doing over the weekend. So, yeah, if you could be 130, 1, 45, 2 o'clock your time. Because a lot of times we don't typically go more than 30 to 45 minutes on the Thursday call.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:37:19.339Z)

Okay? For Thursday. I can possibly make 1pm work like this is Pacific time, though.

### You (2025-09-16T19:37:27.980Z)

Yeah. No, we can't do one.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:37:36.859Z)

I could possibly make 130 work as well. Is this reoccurring or is this bi weekly?

### You (2025-09-16T19:37:41.100Z)

It is. It is. But this would be. So today I'll be bringing up the logo, the one pager, and encouraging Mark to reach out. But if I were able to tell them that you're gonna join our call on Thursday, so they need to make a decision on the logo that Mark has to get you. All this information before Thursday. So it would have two purposes. One, light a fire, get them to start. Working on this. And two, give you a chance to then meet Drew and just spend a few minutes answering questions on the logo. You could probably just be on the call for 15 minutes. At the most.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:38:36.859Z)

I can try to.

### You (2025-09-16T19:38:37.020Z)

I don't need an answer now. Let me know. If it's possible to join. Like I said, Either 131, 45 or 2 o'clock your time, if any of those three slots would be possible.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:38:54.619Z)

Okay. I can do 130 on Thursday. S.

### You (2025-09-16T19:38:58.700Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:39:01.659Z)

So that could. So you could just bring it back to the team and see if that will work.

### You (2025-09-16T19:39:06.380Z)

Yeah. I'm just gonna. I'm just gonna tell them that you'll be there in 1:30 Thursday and that we need to have feedback on the logos. And that Mark has to get you the information. Before then so that you can have something ready to discuss. Doesn't have to be done, doesn't have to be ready to show, but I gotta get him moving on this.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:39:36.139Z)

Okay? And if you can send me the calendar invite for that, that would be great.

### You (2025-09-16T19:39:40.380Z)

I will back in right after the call.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:39:45.019Z)

Yeah. And for the invoices, who should I send? Is there a best contact? Or.

### You (2025-09-16T19:39:54.140Z)

Yeah, let me bring that up in the call. I actually added that on the email when I sent out the PowerPoint. Honestly, since we don't even have a bank account set up, Drew has been kind of putting things on his credit card. He's actually been paying the Offshore team, so my assumption is it'll just go to him. But let me make sure. I mean, even if he just sent it to me and I forward it, that's fine, but I'd rather have. You work with Drew anyway?

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:40:35.819Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:40:36.540Z)

Because like I said, I would imagine that. Outside of this upcoming conference. Everything else, you would probably be working with Drew anyway.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:40:49.339Z)

And what's Drew's background, if you don't mind?

### You (2025-09-16T19:40:52.620Z)

Drew has been in the hotel industry. For a very long time as well. He comes from the asset management side, and he's the one that owns his own business right now. It's called Hotel. Business intelligence services. He goes by hotel bis. And. He gets the financial statements from his clients, but he doesn't have the technology to automatically extract the data. So he copies the financial statements and paste it into his tool. But just like redi Q where you upload the financial statement and they used smart map to map the accounts to the rediq chart of accounts. He does kind of the same thing. So he has aggregated data from a handful of clients. Many of them are quite large clients, so that's a benefit as well. But he basically just puts together Power BI dashboards, and his clients can log in and look at their data versus the market in a particular area. But he was able to get some clients right off the bat. But he hasn't brought on any new clients in over a year. So our relationship is at number one. He's already got a database product. Number two. He's got some clients and some big clients that would be beneficial. To invest. It's likely that we actually may merge his business into Invest and come on board. So he is considered a founder of InnVestAI but he is still running his other business at the same time until we. Can clear everything up and get him in.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:43:04.539Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T19:43:04.780Z)

That's his background. So Mark has the brokerage experience, Drew has the asset management or the day to day operations, and Diane has a lot of the consulting and underwriting. And really kind of a wider range of experience in the hotel industry.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:43:31.419Z)

And then. Sorry, I had another question. It just kind of slipped my mind. It was important. Oh. So, yes, for the Tuesdays and Thursdays. So ideally, I can do Tuesday reoccurring. Thursdays are a bit of. I can. I can. I don't know if I can, like, do it every week because, like, sometimes my team has, like, changing priorities, so they'll shift our calls around.

### You (2025-09-16T19:44:02.140Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:44:09.819Z)

But I know for sure. Like, there's this usually when we kind of have my team calls. But on a Tuesday calls the one that you have today. Maybe I can like join the first half to 15 minutes and then you guys can go over because you guys do a reoccurring on Tuesday as well, right? Tuesday and 13.

Yeah, every Tuesday. It's really our main call of the week.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:44:30.379Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T19:44:32.220Z)

So. No, I think that'd be great.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:44:34.539Z)

That could be an option.

### You (2025-09-16T19:44:36.540Z)

Drew actually kind of drives that call as well. So I know it's a little bit late for today, and I don't want to just have you pop in without their knowledge. So let me propose today also that you can join for a few minutes on Thursday to talk about what we've talked about. But then whether they want you to join every Tuesday or maybe every other Tuesday or whatever to give updates on what's going on with the marketing, I think that's a great idea. Especially when. After this conference material. The website is very important, but we have to get our go to market ready. We have nothing lined up for any type of go to market activities. So I think probably what would be the most important after this is. Yeah. Let's take a little bit to work on the website. Without going overboard, because, again, like I said, we're kind of trying to keep everything low key for now. But we don't have a go to market plan. An actual step by step, what do we do? How are we going to get client feedback? We need to get feedback loops going. And what are we going to do from a marketing standpoint? We going to do direct mail? Is it going to be all social media? Whatever. I have no idea what the hotel industry. Magazines are newsletters. Groups like that that sets all stuff that we have not even started to work on yet. And I think that should have been started a long time ago.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:46:27.979Z)

Yeah. I mean, I have some experience of go to market as well as, you know, so I can definitely help if that's something that you guys would.

### You (2025-09-16T19:46:36.060Z)

Well that I mentioned that to them. I honestly think the logo and the website was kind of a filler project to get you up to speed with InnVestAI But the real reason that I asked them to bring you on is for the go to market. So we have to nail that.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:47:02.299Z)

Yeah. Definitely. I forego to market. I definitely had to have a lot more conversations with everyone on a team for me to just understand as well as like, yeah, Like. I mean, it's similar to redi q, but it's still, like, different, so I need.

### You (2025-09-16T19:47:19.580Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:47:22.139Z)

Understand it a little bit more. But sounds good it isn't. Also Tuesday. It could be at the end of the call as well, if that will help. I think, because choosing is more flexible for me.

### You (2025-09-16T19:47:35.980Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:47:37.419Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T19:47:38.140Z)

Like I said, they almost always go for an hour to hour and a half. So, yeah, maybe if we brought you in at the 45 minute mark, that way we know that we would be on, we can do that as well. So I will bring that up on the call. And we'll try to get lined up.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:48:01.499Z)

Sound. All right. Sounds good. Howard. Owl2.

### You (2025-09-16T19:48:04.620Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:48:07.819Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-16T19:48:07.900Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-16T19:48:08.619Z)
