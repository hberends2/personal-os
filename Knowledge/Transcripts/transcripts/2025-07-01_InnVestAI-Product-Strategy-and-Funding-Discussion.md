### You (2025-07-01T16:05:20.525Z)

Oh oh oh, beyond one. Okay. No. That's it. So there's actually, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:23.146Z)

Okay. Okay. And as far as paperwork going,

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:40.845Z)

It's just a call negative uncertainty. And we my

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:43.316Z)

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:44.105Z)

of my companies, we brought in the someone that we copy sponsored in h one b, but it was, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:48.046Z)

all the paperwork.

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:48.385Z)

for probably a year that we weren't starting if it was gonna get approved. So you you invest a lot in

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:49.946Z)

Yeah. It's just a con uncertainty.

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:53.635Z)

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:54.636Z)

We my one of my companies, brought in and it's something

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:57.245Z)

Visa could not go through because there's a limited number, and then they

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:05:57.656Z)

we got we sponsored an h one b, but it was, like, for

### You (2025-07-01T16:05:59.945Z)

you've kind of forego what you invested in that person.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:01.176Z)

probably a year, there we weren't certain if it was gonna get approved. So you you invest a lot in

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:02.775Z)

Which You could know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:05.706Z)

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:05.925Z)

like, payment processing. That gets through within a week.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:09.086Z)

Aviso could not go through because there's a limited number, and then they

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:09.225Z)

Or so. Didn't know within a week. Whether it's gonna go to not.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:12.026Z)

you you kind of forego what you've invested in that person. No no fault of their own.

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:13.625Z)

And there's extra cost of $2,500

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:16.996Z)

If you do, like, premium processing,

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:18.915Z)

Interesting. Yeah. I mean, that's all good for us to know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:20.916Z)

that gets through within a week or so. You don't know within a week whether it's gonna go through or not.

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:24.565Z)

start to think about creative ways to get this off the ground. Right? Because

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:28.166Z)

Yeah. There's a extra cost of $2,500. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:28.855Z)

I know. There might be some work from now. Here given that Mark knows she's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:32.906Z)

Interesting. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:33.905Z)

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:35.506Z)

Oh, that that I mean, that's all good for us to know, though, as we start

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:35.775Z)

Drew and I too hit coattails. Then. We probably do know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:40.176Z)

to think about creative ways to get this off the ground. Right? Because

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:40.775Z)

in the industry, in hotel industry at least. That is.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:44.066Z)

I don't know, there might be some workarounds here given that

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:46.075Z)

Alright. So where

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:48.116Z)

Mark knows just about everyone in the industry. And if you add Drew and I to his

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:48.685Z)

get one start? Because I know Howard sent out some stuff.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:52.186Z)

coattails, then we probably do know everyone in the

### You (2025-07-01T16:06:52.945Z)

But same time, I know there's some sensitivity to repeating things on this call that we could watch in videos.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:06:56.526Z)

in the hotel industry, at least, that is. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:00.315Z)

I've got some more over the past week, I'd like you guys

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:01.666Z)

through. Or anyone else. May have done something. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:06.636Z)

stuff. But at the same time, I know there's some

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:07.375Z)

I don't know. Just anyone trying to help

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:09.896Z)

sensitivity to repeating things on this call that we could watch in videos.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:10.095Z)

where we could start. It it be pull in pull in in a update and then we can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:14.866Z)

I've done some work over the past week. I can walk you guys through

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:19.545Z)

If that works.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:19.746Z)

or anyone else may have done something. So,

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:20.575Z)

Okay. Website update I want to add that subtitle

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:23.636Z)

I I don't know. Just anyone chime in on where we should start?

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:25.075Z)

sometime that you end send. But we have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:27.606Z)

I can quickly give two minute less than two minutes update, and then we can

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:28.205Z)

can encode that we have changed the template completely when I go on. I'll take

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:33.056Z)

whoever has more updates can yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:33.535Z)

template. They're not there at all. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:35.876Z)

If that works.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:36.205Z)

different template altogether. So I was

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:36.906Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:38.165Z)

help. Him me. To edit that because that'll just change.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:39.216Z)

Website update, I wanted to add that subtitle and Diane that you had

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:42.005Z)

All the layout and everything.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:43.526Z)

sent.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:44.375Z)

I'm

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:44.676Z)

But for some reason

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:44.805Z)

still trying

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:46.276Z)

GoDaddy had changed that template completely. When I go and add it, the template is not there at all.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:46.455Z)

Let's see. It's not critical, but I would just a nice word, and I like the way Neil PATH said it, and I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:52.466Z)

So it's a different template altogether. So I was hesitant to

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:53.105Z)

we could use it as like basically, I literally

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:07:57.136Z)

edit that because that will just change all the layout and everything.

### You (2025-07-01T16:07:57.305Z)

stealing. Deal paths slogan which is, like, deal path. Right? And then I just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:01.446Z)

But I'm still trying. Let's see.

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:02.735Z)

add InvestAI and I put hotels are different

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:04.626Z)

It's not critical, Vinod. It's just a nice word, and I like the way deal path

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:05.665Z)

and then I use the exact log that they use except I put purpose

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:09.566Z)

set it. And I think we could use it as, like, if

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:10.385Z)

built for hospitality That was it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:12.646Z)

basically, I'm literally stealing DealPath's

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:12.755Z)

Got it. So, yeah, that's why I need to change the uploading and then change the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:16.716Z)

slogo, which is, like, DealPath. Right? And then I just

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:18.055Z)

entirely how to try Second thing,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:20.336Z)

add AI, and I put hotels are different. And then I used

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:21.385Z)

is the infrastructure calls and everything. So Howard and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:24.316Z)

the exact slogan they use, except I put purpose built for

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:25.995Z)

we discussed that yesterday.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:28.926Z)

hospitality. That was it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:30.215Z)

Could provide you the numbers

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:31.496Z)

Got it. So, yeah, I mean, that's why I didn't

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:32.365Z)

based on what we have in what we have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:35.236Z)

change it. Otherwise, it'll change in entirely out, but I'll still try.

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:35.615Z)

now. But then I guess we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:38.646Z)

Second thing is, the infrastructure cost

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:39.805Z)

kind of put together what all features will be there when down the line

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:42.836Z)

and everything. So Howard and me discussed that yesterday.

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:43.895Z)

next twenty four months or one year. Okay. I cannot really budget it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:48.336Z)

Like, I could provide you the numbers

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:48.575Z)

Accurately. So probably

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:51.176Z)

based on what we have in

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:52.075Z)

we should decide what all we want.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:53.156Z)

what we have developed right now.

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:54.085Z)

Do we want some AI features? How do all

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:55.016Z)

But then unless we

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:56.685Z)

handle that data? Is stored the data? Would, you know, like, create

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:08:57.316Z)

really kinda put together what all features

### You (2025-07-01T16:08:59.835Z)

data with how much are just working

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:00.456Z)

will be dealt when down the line next twenty four months or one year.

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:03.095Z)

some databases.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:05.306Z)

I cannot really budget it accurately.

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:07.545Z)

You know? Train that or or we just want to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:09.636Z)

So probably, we should decide what all we want. Do we want

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:10.975Z)

to go and and take this thing if we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:13.556Z)

some AI features? How do we want to handle our data? Is

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:13.625Z)

using here. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:16.576Z)

the data or, you know, create

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:17.195Z)

That's probably a really great segue something I work

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:19.216Z)

a data warehouse or just work with some databases.

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:20.025Z)

on this week. Which was trying to put together there. High level two year.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:25.146Z)

All that or, you know, or train our own model or we just want to

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:25.645Z)

Budget. For the entire plan. Platform. Backing it to $2,000,000.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:29.726Z)

go with existing APIs if we are using AI tools.

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:31.445Z)

But I couldn't really do it given like and and I can mark you guys

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:34.376Z)

Okay. And that's probably a really great

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:36.335Z)

through. Why I didn't write work

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:37.396Z)

segue into something I worked on this week, which was trying to put together

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:37.965Z)

but I didn't get it to a high level budget for two years using

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:41.906Z)

a very high level two year budget for the entire

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:42.035Z)

$2,800,000 It has a technology line So I get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:47.416Z)

backing into $2,000,000.

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:47.945Z)

to be, like, backing in the each line item. Saying,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:50.346Z)

I couldn't really do it given, like and and I can walk you guys

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:50.735Z)

it's just kind of reasonable given what. Work we need to do. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:55.166Z)

through why it didn't quite work. But I did get to a high

### You (2025-07-01T16:09:55.675Z)

during this call, I can pop it up and share it. And then we can each walk away

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:09:58.636Z)

level budget for two years using $2,800,000.

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:00.125Z)

think about it. And circle back. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:03.066Z)

It has a technology line. So I get

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:03.745Z)

For me to, like budget, if if we could

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:06.326Z)

we kinda be, like, backing into each line item saying,

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:06.395Z)

you know, say, every time. Develop this feature, and then I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:09.526Z)

is this kind of reasonable given what

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:09.735Z)

could say, you know, this is what we need for this feature. And that way, you know, we could

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:12.166Z)

work we need to do? But

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:14.015Z)

kind of come up with some sort of budget. For basic

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:14.656Z)

during this call, I can pop it up and share it, and then we can each

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:17.735Z)

a model like, you know, what Howard has been working on

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:18.246Z)

walk away and think about it. And circle back.

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:20.475Z)

that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:21.166Z)

That's good. For me to, like, budget it

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:21.195Z)

We, you know, we what posting. Company that can be able to say, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:24.496Z)

we could, you know, say we're gonna develop this feature and then I

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:26.495Z)

Google will a database.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:28.696Z)

say, you know, this is what we need with this feature. And that way, you know, we could

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:28.805Z)

That can be post grad. Right now, I'm using post grads on my local

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:32.766Z)

kind of come up with some sort of budget. For basic

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:32.805Z)

And certain 50 feature features

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:36.536Z)

model, like, you know, what Howard has been working on, for that,

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:36.985Z)

to start with and then kind of a scale that down the line based on how many users

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:40.126Z)

we, you know, we need one hosting company that can be AWS as your Google We need a database that can be post right now, I'm using post

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:42.785Z)

how we have But just to kind of achieve. But I don't think that would incur a lot of expenses.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:50.096Z)

And we need certain few few future features

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:52.125Z)

But you know, but for, like, but thing for twenty four hours the twenty four years will

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:10:56.206Z)

start with. And, you know, then we'll kind of scale that down the line based

### You (2025-07-01T16:10:58.585Z)

kind of to work. Turn down more on the features.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:00.366Z)

how many users we have.

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:02.375Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:02.596Z)

But just to kind of

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:03.275Z)

Yeah. I agree. Okay. You'll be like, oh, that's a little high level there, Diane. But at least I feel

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:06.186Z)

this much, I don't think that would incur a lot of expenses. But

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:10.555Z)

like something that we could put into a pitch

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:11.776Z)

but for, like, budgeting for twenty four hours,

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:12.855Z)

book. But it it definitely needs a lot a lot of scrubbing.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:15.516Z)

the twenty four years will kind of, need to drill down more on the features.

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:16.405Z)

Did did we have a list of what? Parts of our platform could be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:20.486Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:21.595Z)

done with

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:21.676Z)

I yeah. I agree.

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:22.135Z)

AI.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:23.286Z)

When you guys see what I pulled, you'll be like, oh, that's a little high level there, Diane. But

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:25.045Z)

Because And it's something that know, as as we go into the next moment,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:28.136Z)

at least I feel like it's something that we could put into a pitch book, but it

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:29.025Z)

I I sent an email. Yeah. Think you know, the second or third question that investors are gonna ask is, you know, what element

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:32.686Z)

it definitely needs a lot a lot of scrubbing. So do we have a list of what

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:36.455Z)

of our platform are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:37.906Z)

parts of our platform could be done with AI?

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:37.935Z)

they based. I mean, that is certainly the obsession

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:41.926Z)

Because

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:41.975Z)

you know. Right now. And you know, I think that we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:44.796Z)

mean, I think that, you know, as as we go into the next mode,

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:45.275Z)

need to really have a strong AI story

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:47.806Z)

of capital raising,

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:47.955Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:49.536Z)

you know, I I think

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:49.735Z)

Any forecasting and audit detection

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:51.116Z)

you know, the second or third question that investors are gonna ask is, you know, what elements of our

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:53.125Z)

for those type of things can definitely be done using

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:55.936Z)

platform are AI based. I mean, that is certainly the

### You (2025-07-01T16:11:57.945Z)

But we can. Kind of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:11:59.776Z)

obsession

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:00.615Z)

go

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:00.696Z)

you know, right now.

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:01.235Z)

more. Deep and, you know, do a lot more work than that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:02.496Z)

And, you know, I I think that we need to really have a strong AI story

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:04.675Z)

Yeah. Mark, I'll we can really

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:08.126Z)

Any forecasting anomaly detection,

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:08.245Z)

like you know, since maybe it's we should think about this, but really come up with, like, a list on paper.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:11.626Z)

all those type of things can definitely be done using

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:12.885Z)

In some file. That shows, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:16.326Z)

AI. But, you know, we can kind of go

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:16.335Z)

all the AI benefits and you know, doesn't necessarily have to be part of version

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:20.276Z)

more deep and, you know, do a lot more work than that.

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:21.935Z)

one. Right? Like, I'm not saying we have to do a little bit, you know, overnight, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:23.796Z)

Yeah. But but I think I think we should really, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:25.045Z)

it's part of our plan, whether it's a three month plan or a six month plan.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:27.656Z)

know? And maybe it's we should just think about this, but really come up with, like, a list on paper or

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:28.885Z)

You know, we should just have break. Clear and precise

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:32.356Z)

some file

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:32.765Z)

plan.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:33.426Z)

that shows, you know, all the AI

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:34.435Z)

Of what AI can do. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:36.646Z)

benefits and, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:37.265Z)

you can think of how I just think everyone that we talked about, this is gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:38.986Z)

doesn't necessarily have to be part of version one. Right? Like, I'm not saying we have to do with all this, you know, overnight, but

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:40.725Z)

sort of obsess over the AI component.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:43.926Z)

as part of our plan, whether it's a three month plan or a six month plan,

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:45.205Z)

Yeah. Mark, take a take a look at your email. I sent out

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:48.156Z)

you know, we should just have a very clear

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:49.665Z)

something prior to the call.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:50.696Z)

and precise

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:51.675Z)

Related directly.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:51.896Z)

plan

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:52.945Z)

So Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:53.676Z)

of what AI can do. And you because, again, I just think

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:54.835Z)

No. No. No. That's fine. It's it's it's not

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:57.716Z)

everyone that we talked about, this is gonna

### You (2025-07-01T16:12:57.735Z)

really a list of everything. I mean, I've I've got ideas

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:12:59.796Z)

sort of obsess over the

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:01.085Z)

Everybody's got ideas. And so I do have a place where we can centralize

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:01.696Z)

AI components. Right. I mean, that also

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:06.055Z)

all that. We start putting together plans. So Okay. As you know, you were stepping which is good.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:11.286Z)

Oh, you did? Oh, I'm sorry. I I'm a little behind on emails this morning.

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:12.875Z)

And that was this is on. Junior. Teams. Right? When you sent the this hour, this is in the the Teams. Link. On. Trello. Through. Like, Trello. Yeah. They have I I add there. And, Mark, I even I even mentioned in there. I know I know that you don't use Teams, which is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:27.866Z)

Oh, great. As as usual, you were a step ahead of me, which is good. And that was this is on you're you're, on

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:33.315Z)

which is fine. So if you have anything you wanna add

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:36.016Z)

on Teams. Right? When you sent the this

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:37.715Z)

just shoot an email.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:38.736Z)

Howard, this is in the

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:38.745Z)

And and I can add it to the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:40.236Z)

the Teams link on

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:40.565Z)

team Teams list Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:42.266Z)

Trello through like, Trello InvestAI.

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:43.355Z)

Thank you. No. Thank

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:13:45.236Z)

Trello. Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:13:49.445Z)

POs. So as far as POC and demoing forward. Three hard. Five what we have right now or I think you probably will have a log in and then we'll kind of embed this

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:01.806Z)

Okay. Thank you. Yep.

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:04.005Z)

what we have right

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:04.456Z)

Other thing Howard and me were discussing yesterday about POC

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:06.585Z)

now. Go with that. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:09.426Z)

So as far as POC and demoing goal, we are

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:12.145Z)

Well, I just drink.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:14.086Z)

fine with we have right now? Or

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:16.985Z)

Proof of concept?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:17.016Z)

because earlier, we were thinking probably we'll have a login and we'll

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:17.975Z)

Right? So it is it's not like it's our first version.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:20.916Z)

kind of embed this

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:21.815Z)

Right? Like that. Right. Yeah. So I I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:24.446Z)

we have right now in the other application and, you know, go with that.

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:24.725Z)

we should try keep it at a affordable scale, you know, and, you know, and and we're gonna let

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:29.416Z)

But

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:29.775Z)

everyone know. This is proof of concept, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:31.576Z)

my personal right. And I'm gonna jump in first, but anyone can chime in. Is this

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:32.475Z)

that would be my 2¢ on it. Yeah. Let let let me clarify. I think that'll that'll

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:35.676Z)

is a proof of concept. Right? So it is intent. It's not like it's our first version or anything like that. So I I think we should

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:37.565Z)

help everybody. So we are working right now on what we are referring as the proof of concept. As a proof of concept,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:44.326Z)

to keep it as affordable, you know, at

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:45.925Z)

this is intended for us to demo

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:47.406Z)

at you know? And and we're gonna let everyone know this is a proof of concept, but

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:49.055Z)

to other people. Right? So we can get online. We can share our screen. We can say, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:14:51.646Z)

that would be my 2¢ on it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:14:55.345Z)

here's the here's the model. You know, this is where you input this information. They'll see numbers changing. They'll do everything they can, but they're not gonna log in and use the model. So after the proof of concept is what we call the the MVP, minimum buy product. This is where then we will have a version where the users can log in and start basically kicking the tires themselves. So it is a it it's a it's a two pronged approach. You know? I just don't want anybody think that a proof of concept means external users will be in the position to start using That that will be after we have that initial discussion get some feedback from the users, And we also need time Basically, it buys us some time because we have to take what I built in a very fragile, no code environment and the node is gonna have to put that into a a legitimate enterprise level database and and and what we were just talking about. You know, we're gonna have to know, you know, where are we gonna store this where where is the data gonna be stored. So while we are out providing these demos to the users as a proof of concept, he can still be working on that. So it's not like it's it's not like a linear project where you have to do this before we can get to that MVP we can do it concurrently. So How how many test to know? About that? Actually producing accurate results? So We can do that internally. It it does calculate Right? So every time they Right. As I've been showing in the demos, when you put in the value, it calculates. So that's something internally. We can do. Right. So we go through what the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:16:50.236Z)

How how how do we test to know though that it's actually producing

### You (2025-07-01T16:16:50.755Z)

Right. Yeah. And it's twofold. That's right. Getting down the piano online. Correctly, and then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:16:54.726Z)

results? Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:16:55.115Z)

also calculating correctly.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:16:56.566Z)

right.

### You (2025-07-01T16:16:56.725Z)

Things like higher or leveraged higher or right, debt service coverage ratio. Debt yields, all all those types

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:03.256Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:03.655Z)

that Mark talks about Yeah. That are gonna be important metrics. Yeah. Now remember, I'm not

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:07.726Z)

And it right. And

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:08.735Z)

I'm not advocating

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:09.576Z)

right. And it's twofold. That's right. Getting down to the NOI line

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:10.825Z)

that we go out prematurely.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:13.046Z)

correctly, and then it's also calculating correctly things like

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:13.505Z)

But we're gonna be doing online demos.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:16.486Z)

IRR, leveraged IRR, right, debt service coverage ratios,

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:16.635Z)

And nobody is gonna know if we input a number in this cell, if that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:20.886Z)

debt yields, all all those things that Mark talks about that are gonna be important metrics. Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:21.105Z)

IRR is correct. Down to the decimal point right. They just wanna see numbers changing and Yep. Right. But yeah. Because We get feedback. From me. People. What concept would they be? That's that's we'll we'll we'll start getting actual user feedback. From the MVP. So the POC is a teaser.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:41.576Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:43.145Z)

This is saying, look. This is what we got.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:44.176Z)

That move. Right? That move. Right? Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:45.375Z)

What do you think? You know? And they're gonna see us going through and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:48.216Z)

So so how how will we get feedback from people if if

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:50.225Z)

running through a demo of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:17:52.146Z)

the proof of concept, if they can't log in? Like, what would they be?

### You (2025-07-01T16:17:52.575Z)

creating a model we're gonna be able to create that model in a matter of minutes. Right? It's not gonna take long. And they're gonna wanna test it out. And then we say, okay. That's when we allow them access to the MVP. It might be a week. It might be two weeks depending on how much work the node has gotta put into it. But yeah, I mean, that's basically the this will be. Yeah. We're the I guess, point of the POC to again, get feedback. Verbally verbally or or someone maybe anecdotally that we are directionally you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:32.336Z)

We

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:32.415Z)

accurate as to, like, what we are developing how we're developing it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:37.216Z)

we

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:37.475Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:38.036Z)

yeah, we wanna use the, I guess, the point of the POC to

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:38.265Z)

the the MVP we get users actually on it, people are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:42.246Z)

and get feedback

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:42.555Z)

more detailed, I guess,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:43.876Z)

verbally verbally or or or somewhat maybe anecdotally.

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:45.065Z)

Yeah. Exactly. Feedback. Right? Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:48.106Z)

That we are directionally you know, accurate as to, like, what we are developing and and how we're developing it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:52.935Z)

Put in their number on their own. We can see how the calculations are.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:56.706Z)

And then the

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:56.905Z)

Yeah. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:18:57.936Z)

the MVP, when we get users actually on it, would be more

### You (2025-07-01T16:18:59.035Z)

Now one of the things to to remember on the on this proof of concept

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:19:01.666Z)

more detailed, I guess, feedback. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:19:04.085Z)

it it does not have what we call persistent data.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:19:06.276Z)

Yeah. They can play directly with the POC version too. Right? We could

### You (2025-07-01T16:19:08.055Z)

Memory. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:19:09.926Z)

hand over them the URL and they can put in their number on their own.

### You (2025-07-01T16:19:10.455Z)

every time that you go in you you can put in numbers, and you could

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:19:13.966Z)

See how the calculations are done and all.

### You (2025-07-01T16:19:14.255Z)

actually underwrite a deal. Okay? But when you log off, you log back in, it's all gonna be reset to zero. Right? So it's not intended to keep going on. The MVP will have persistent memory. So that you can create a model. You can go back and tweak it. Use it just like you would in real life. So there's little bit of difference between what what we can put together using the tools that we're using for the proof of concept versus what will be actually attainable when Vinod converts it into know, what I call, you know, the real thing. On the MVP. That's that's how I mean, I would think. That's like, a a lot of users for a lot of users, that's fine. Right? Like, they're not gonna use this to to to underwrite a real deal anyway, so it's going to be a you know, they're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:08.906Z)

That's

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:09.245Z)

sign on put put some numbers in, you know, play around, click some things, and then sign off.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:11.926Z)

that's prob I mean, I would think that's like, a a lot of users

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:14.335Z)

Give us feedback. Yep. Yeah. Which may be something we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:17.846Z)

for a lot of users, that's fine.

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:17.965Z)

wanna consider because what I was gonna say is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:20.256Z)

Right? Like, they're not gonna

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:20.285Z)

I don't I wouldn't want

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:21.776Z)

use this to to to underwrite a real deal anyway, so it's going to be a

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:21.835Z)

there to be huge gap. Between email. You know, like, showing them

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:26.566Z)

you know, they're gonna

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:26.715Z)

a proof of concept, getting that initial

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:28.376Z)

sign on

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:28.545Z)

feedback, Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:29.806Z)

put some numbers in, you know, play around, click some things, and then sign off and give us feedback.

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:30.495Z)

if we wait two to three months before getting them, like, the to log in and really use, that's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:35.366Z)

Which may be something we wanna consider. Because what I was gonna say is

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:36.615Z)

too long. I I think you're gonna you're gonna people are gonna forget. They're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:39.406Z)

I don't I wouldn't want

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:40.445Z)

move on. They're

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:40.896Z)

there to be a huge gap

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:41.325Z)

They're gonna you're gonna build this excitement, and then you're gonna lose it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:43.566Z)

between know, like, showing them a proof of concept, getting that initial feedback,

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:45.405Z)

Don't know exactly. What the optimal time period is, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:48.666Z)

Right? Like, if we wait

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:48.705Z)

you know, couple of weeks at most.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:50.386Z)

two to three months before getting them, like, the MVP

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:51.135Z)

And if we can bridge that gap by using

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:53.856Z)

to log in and really use, that's

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:54.745Z)

POC, even if it doesn't have persistent memory, we can we can do a demo

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:55.676Z)

too long. I I think you're gonna you're gonna people are gonna forget

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:58.905Z)

Right? We can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:20:58.996Z)

They're gonna move on. They're whatever. They're gonna you're gonna build this excitement, and then you're gonna lose it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:20:59.715Z)

show them what we have. Make sure it's directionally accurate.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:03.816Z)

I don't know exactly what the optimal time period is, but, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:04.305Z)

Make some tweaks based on feedback. Wait you know, two,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:08.446Z)

couple of weeks at most.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:08.675Z)

three weeks at most, Give these same users access

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:10.196Z)

And if we can bridge that gap

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:12.785Z)

to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:12.836Z)

by using the POC, even if it doesn't have persistent memory, we can

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:13.395Z)

the POC, let them play around with it, give us more feedback,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:16.576Z)

we can do a demo. Right? We can show them what we have.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:17.525Z)

and then you know, then we and then we've I think, you know, you both

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:20.646Z)

Make sure it's directionally accurate,

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:21.955Z)

you've built more like, you've built some durations here and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:22.816Z)

make some tweaks based on feedback, wait

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:26.145Z)

excitement. Right? And then we can wait

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:26.196Z)

know? Two, three weeks at most,

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:27.505Z)

a month month and a half, two months at most

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:29.286Z)

gives these same users access to the POC.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:31.285Z)

to build the MVP that's more that somebody might use

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:33.386Z)

Let them play around with it. Give us more feedback.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:34.565Z)

I guess, like, I'd say they might use

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:36.466Z)

And then, you know, then we and then we've I think, you know, you've built

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:37.645Z)

for real. Right? Yep. To underwrite a real deal. Yeah. The way I see this playing out and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:41.376Z)

you've built more like, you've built some duration to your

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:43.175Z)

correct me if or if you disagree,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:45.086Z)

excitement. Right? And then we could wait

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:46.625Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:46.846Z)

a month month and a half, two months at most,

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:47.245Z)

the proof of concept what I would want them to do

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:50.326Z)

to build the MVP that's more that somebody might use

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:50.555Z)

is to take one of their existing models something that they've already done

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:53.686Z)

I guess, like, I'd say they might use it for real.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:55.475Z)

and then put the same inputs into our model

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:21:57.246Z)

Right? Like, to underwrite a real deal.

### You (2025-07-01T16:21:59.545Z)

and make sure that it calculates and everything that ties up. So, you know, they'll have an Excel model that they worked on for weeks and they'll take our proof of concept and they go and plug in the numbers And boom. Know, they they've got it. So my first my first thing is that I wanna make sure of is that the numbers that we're calculating are correct. Mean math is math. Right? I don't expect to have any wild variations. So, you know, that's one thing we wanted to for one second. Is that that be that, like, during the depth of the proof of concept demo? Like, we'd be like, turn it over to them. Somehow. Not not turning them. I would do the demo. Right? Get get them on there and then just say,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:22:44.216Z)

Howard, we're pausing for one second. Is that would would that mean that, like, during the the proof of concept demo, like, we basically turn it over to them somehow, and then with us? No. Okay. No. Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:22:44.515Z)

you know, here you go. And I'm talking about the people that you've already spoke to. You've already talked about CBRE has some people that are willing to work on it. You know, Berecadia has a couple of people. Know? So not to go in not to go in the yeah. Yeah. Right. So all of these people that are basically they're volunteering to help us test. Right? So we would do it in baby steps. So the first step is compare the output

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:23:08.536Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:23:11.615Z)

to a model they've already done. If they if they think their model is right,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:23:14.266Z)

Marks. Marks.

### You (2025-07-01T16:23:16.035Z)

and our numbers tie, cool.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:23:18.256Z)

Analyst. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:23:19.415Z)

We're done. Then go on to step two which is then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:23:19.876Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:23:22.795Z)

now underwrite a new a deal. Right? Or or, you know, continue to do it side by side, but then we we wanna get into an actual real life scenario of going But it's still within that internal user group that we already identified. They have to help us get through that first hurdle. Then we can go to any prospect. Right? And then go from there. Got Got it. Mark, would are your thoughts on that? Because you're, like, you're you're you're you're gonna be you're It's you're you know, the I mean, the the acquisition that I acquisition guys that are out there You know, sounds fine. I mean, a couple

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:11.516Z)

Got it. Got it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:12.865Z)

one, I think we can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:13.696Z)

Mark, what are your thoughts on that?

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:13.915Z)

certainly do the testing ourselves.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:15.556Z)

Because you're, like, your your user your user group is probably gonna be the

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:17.385Z)

Before. You know? Because I I would wanna it wouldn't be a great

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:20.716Z)

you know, the

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:20.905Z)

for us. If it's not working

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:22.476Z)

I mean, the fee

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:24.115Z)

properly.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:24.376Z)

acquisition guys, young acquisition guys that are out there,

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:24.785Z)

Bring them on, I think we wanted to be as you know, working as well as it can be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:28.106Z)

You know, I I I think that sounds fine. I mean, I

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:28.475Z)

before. Even have those initial Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:31.126Z)

couple of I mean, one, I think that we can

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:32.095Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:33.206Z)

certainly do the testing ourselves.

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:33.315Z)

But but also, I mean, do know do we have a schedule of kind of, like, what we think

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:36.226Z)

Even before they get on because I I wouldn't wanna it wouldn't be a great look for us

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:37.635Z)

you know, the timeline is to do all this? Again, just so that we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:41.056Z)

if

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:41.165Z)

feel that, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:41.646Z)

it's not working properly when we bring them on. I think we want it to be as

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:42.125Z)

in terms of what we've just planning for the future. Like, we have, like, a

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:45.896Z)

you know, working as well as it can be before we even have those initial

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:46.365Z)

60 that look ahead terms of what we wanna start doing this because, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:49.776Z)

presentations.

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:51.105Z)

of people are on vacation for the summer, and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:52.766Z)

But but also, I mean, you know, do we have a schedule of

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:53.985Z)

you know, I I think it would wanna start

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:55.786Z)

kind of, like, what we think, you know, the timeline is to do all this? Again,

### You (2025-07-01T16:24:56.115Z)

maybe scheduling some of these calls, you know, even if they're three, four weeks from them.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:24:59.786Z)

so that we because I you know, in terms of of just

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:00.495Z)

Whatever may be. I'm not trying to you up. Just trying to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:02.696Z)

planning for the future,

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:02.865Z)

like, can we plan ahead sixty, ninety days?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:04.666Z)

do we have, like, a sixty day look ahead in terms of

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:05.435Z)

Just to have a set? So when we think we wanna do some of these things?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:07.576Z)

when we wanna start doing this? Because, you know, a lot of people

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:09.415Z)

Yeah. I actually I I think for the initial

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:11.346Z)

are on vacation for the summer and,

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:12.845Z)

demo,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:13.686Z)

know, I I think if we wanna start

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:14.005Z)

three to four weeks is is doable.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:15.476Z)

maybe scheduling some of these calls, you know, even

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:16.815Z)

I mean, I've we're really close with with the model I've got now.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:18.496Z)

they're three, four weeks from now or whenever it may be. I'm not trying to pressure you. I'm just trying to, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:22.175Z)

I was

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:22.826Z)

can we plan ahead sixty, ninety days just to have a sense of

### You (2025-07-01T16:25:23.525Z)

talking to to Vinod yesterday. What I need to do is I need to go through

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:25:26.096Z)

when we think we wanna do some of these things?

and double check the formulas because as I mentioned in the demos, it's getting to the point where I've kind of really pushing the limits of this tool in terms of what it can do. Without somebody who actually is a coder getting in there and making the changes So I I wanna make sure I take it very carefully step by step. Making sure that when I create the formula for this row, it doesn't break other rows like it has already in the past. So I'm comfortable with, you know, you know, maybe even two to three weeks. On getting you know, the the basic information there. Now you know, you you gave me some great feedback. Drew gave me some good feedback on the you know, the latest demo that I put out. We be able to incorporate all of that? No. No. Some of that is gonna have to wait until later. But it's not difficult items that you've suggested. It's just something that I'm I'm just afraid to even add something like that now. It could actually set us back three weeks and not help us. So yeah, I I think, you know, we're very, very close right now. To being able to at least get on the phone and share a screen and through it. I I have to things to say. One is is 10 field. Also be used to show two. 48. You know, as an investor or know, anyone. Who's kind of interested investing. The

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:08.806Z)

I I have two things to say. One is

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:10.085Z)

second thing is I'll be Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:13.436Z)

can this POC also be used to show

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:13.745Z)

In MVP. Volume. Do we want open up.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:16.996Z)

to potential, you know, angel investors or

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:19.585Z)

To an application that will

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:21.336Z)

anyone

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:21.915Z)

But you know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:22.406Z)

who's kind of interested

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:22.885Z)

the user

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:25.166Z)

in investing.

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:27.155Z)

we are importing data.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:27.686Z)

The

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:29.245Z)

Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:29.556Z)

second thing is MVP. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:30.415Z)

You know. And getting the data from database or anything. So want to focus on that or

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:32.966Z)

MVP version, what do we want to focus on solely

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:35.605Z)

we want to take a different approach?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:36.766Z)

on developing this model

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:37.565Z)

What's the most expensive

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:39.236Z)

to an application level wherein, you know, the user is hard coding most of the data in this tool.

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:44.105Z)

into user interface,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:46.536Z)

We are importing data, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:47.375Z)

data ingestion.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:48.876Z)

we are not, you know, getting the data from any database or anything.

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:49.995Z)

And I mean, I'm sure there are other broad categories, you know, like

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:52.946Z)

Do we want to focus on that? Or

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:53.605Z)

what what's the most costly and time consuming and what's the least costly and time consuming.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:27:55.026Z)

want to take a different approach? What's the most expensive

### You (2025-07-01T16:27:58.445Z)

Mean, least costly is what we have right now.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:01.156Z)

What like, if you were to break it into

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:01.705Z)

That, you know, he was a imports all the data. We just get in the forms, the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:04.276Z)

user interface, data model,

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:05.605Z)

bunch, you know, the but that's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:06.906Z)

data ingestion,

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:07.145Z)

that's not too great.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:08.566Z)

And, I mean, I'm sure there are other broad categories

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:09.005Z)

User experience. That's right. So just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:12.216Z)

you know, like, what what's the most costly and time consuming and what's the least

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:12.505Z)

real quick. Was thinking about this the other day or some

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:16.436Z)

costly and time consuming?

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:16.845Z)

changes we had.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:17.766Z)

I mean, least costly is what we have right now. That, you know, user inputs all the data. We just create the forms, step

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:21.805Z)

Like, the way our system works is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:25.166Z)

punch in all the data. But that's

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:25.695Z)

it it's it's I think

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:26.596Z)

that's not great user experience. That's like Well,

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:27.195Z)

say things are automated, but in reality, they're they're not. They're automated to some degree.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:31.396Z)

just real quick. I was thinking about this

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:32.305Z)

Part of the automation, if you're the customer and you're the patient,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:34.586Z)

the other day, some changes we had.

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:35.725Z)

company, of the automation

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:38.296Z)

Like, the way our system works

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:38.305Z)

comes from the fact that it's just you're not doing it. It's been pushed out to other

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:43.236Z)

is it it's it's I we we say things are

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:44.245Z)

other user groups. Yeah. So in the case of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:47.336Z)

automated, but in reality, they're they're not they they are automated to some degree.

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:48.005Z)

like, getting STR reports,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:51.466Z)

But part of the automation, if you're the customer and you're the paying

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:51.505Z)

rather than having our customers, the owner, upload SDR reports to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:55.266Z)

company, part of the automation comes

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:56.855Z)

our portal like, our platform.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:28:58.306Z)

from the fact that it's just you're not doing it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:28:59.525Z)

That that process of clicking and dragging just to our port gets

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:01.746Z)

It's been pushed out to other

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:03.555Z)

pushed out to the operator.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:03.656Z)

other user groups.

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:04.855Z)

To a director of finance.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:06.216Z)

In the case of

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:06.925Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:07.466Z)

like, getting

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:08.405Z)

similar for uploading,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:09.046Z)

STR reports,

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:09.655Z)

data files and doing other things. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:11.076Z)

rather than having our customers, the owner,

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:11.695Z)

It gets pushed out to other users that are that are closer to the source of the data.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:14.286Z)

upload STR reports to our

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:16.715Z)

And the origination

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:16.746Z)

portal, like our platform, that

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:18.265Z)

of the data. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:19.406Z)

that process of clicking and dragging the SDR port gets pushed out to the operator.

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:19.785Z)

basically, set of the customer email or the owner emailing somebody and saying, hey. Give me this thing I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:24.306Z)

To a director of finance.

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:25.225Z)

need. That email

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:26.296Z)

So

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:26.595Z)

back and unloading it themselves. We just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:27.136Z)

and similar for uploading data files and doing

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:28.435Z)

skip the emails. We just say, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:30.276Z)

other things. Right? It gets pushed out to other users that are that are closer to the source of

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:30.715Z)

tell us who's gonna upload it and they're gonna do it. So what I was thinking for us, and I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:35.126Z)

the data. And the origination of the data. Right? So

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:35.915Z)

sort of was asking about this in one of my prior emails was that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:39.216Z)

basically, instead of

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:39.365Z)

if our customer

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:40.576Z)

the customer or the owner emailing somebody and saying, hey. Give me this thing I need.

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:41.055Z)

let's say our customer's broker, and use this, We've been thinking the way I've been thinking of it is that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:45.006Z)

Them emailing it back and then loading it themselves. We just skip the emails. We just say,

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:47.495Z)

the the broker is going to get all this stuff and then load it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:49.586Z)

you know, tell us who's gonna upload it, and they're gonna do it. So

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:51.075Z)

Or it's going to get loaded automatically somehow. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:53.026Z)

I was thinking for us, and I sort of was asking about this in one of my

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:55.195Z)

But I think maybe the way

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:57.306Z)

prior emails, was that

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:57.675Z)

should be setting this up

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:29:58.746Z)

if our customer let's say our customer is a broker,

### You (2025-07-01T16:29:58.805Z)

is similar to what what Toby asked us is that if you're broker,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:02.466Z)

and they're gonna use this,

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:02.885Z)

and you're you somebody comes and says, I don't wanna update it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:04.256Z)

We've been think the way I've been thinking of it is that

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:05.555Z)

Book you know, via the or I wanna come, you know, look at selling this property.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:06.746Z)

the the broker is going to get all this stuff and then load it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:08.985Z)

Then you said that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:10.536Z)

Or

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:10.655Z)

like, they get some upload form

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:11.416Z)

it's going to get loaded automatically somehow. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:13.495Z)

or link to an upload form.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:14.736Z)

But what I think maybe the way that we should be setting this up is similar to what

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:15.045Z)

And maybe maybe some seller that's doing it. Maybe it's the seller's gonna provide

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:19.026Z)

Potopia IS does is that you're the broker and you're you somebody comes and says, I want an updated

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:19.495Z)

to the you know, to the operator. Or something like that. Right? So, basically, you're the paying customer,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:24.886Z)

book, you know, BOV or I wanna come, you know, look at selling this property, then

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:26.065Z)

this case, like broker. You you can't gap

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:28.906Z)

you send a like, they get some upload form or a link to an upload form

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:30.385Z)

all this data without having to do it. Kind of she can email manually. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:34.456Z)

maybe maybe it's not the seller that's doing it. Maybe it's the seller's gonna provide it to

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:34.735Z)

File by file or or me every year or whatever. Yeah. The same thing. You do. You're home.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:39.426Z)

the

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:39.685Z)

An ocean.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:40.666Z)

you know, to the operator or something like that. Right? And so, basically, if you're the paying customer,

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:41.045Z)

Investor in here. You're looking to rather than

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:45.156Z)

in this case, like, the broker, you're you can

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:45.455Z)

get all this data.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:48.406Z)

gather all this data without having to do it

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:48.435Z)

You know, from dinner room. It's like okay. Like, on the exact yeah. We have to get by on all this stuff, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:51.516Z)

kind of via email manually, you know, file by file or or year by year or whatever. You know? And the same thing, if you're if you're

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:55.435Z)

year out of the somebody down the street. Right upstream, I guess, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:30:59.086Z)

an ownership group, if you're an investor and you're you're looking to, you know, underwrite a bunch of properties,

### You (2025-07-01T16:30:59.145Z)

submit the files. Right? Somehow you so, like, we don't need to have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:03.846Z)

rather than

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:04.045Z)

this it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:05.076Z)

getting all this data, you know, from data rooms. Like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:05.185Z)

sense what I'm setting Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:10.086Z)

mean, again, like, don't know exactly how we'd have to get buy in on all this, but, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:11.605Z)

Now. Spent so much of my

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:13.636Z)

if you're you have the somebody downstream, right, or upstream, I guess, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:14.225Z)

around. Like this is a pain point I wanna solve for the industry.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:18.456Z)

submit the files. Right? Somehow you like, we don't need to have

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:19.345Z)

So, like, if I were to look out 12 months from now, I would want

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:23.136Z)

is is this making sense, what I'm saying?

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:23.425Z)

for our platform to somehow true

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:25.736Z)

It does. Can I jump in for a second, though? Because that's someone who has literally been the person here

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:25.865Z)

be odd. That. Gonna walk back from the owner's perspective.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:30.286Z)

talking, right, I have spent so much of my career shooting information around everyone. Like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:32.055Z)

Refinance, our sensitive. To an operator. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:35.136Z)

this is a pain point I wanna solve for the industry.

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:36.095Z)

They could care less. Who the lender who is on a hotel.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:38.516Z)

So, like, if I were to look out twelve months from now,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:39.335Z)

Refinance. All the time. Something

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:41.806Z)

I would want for our platform to somehow truly be automating that.

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:42.195Z)

like a pro opinion of value on a hotel sale That's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:46.596Z)

And now I'm gonna walk back from the owner's perspective,

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:46.645Z)

sends up red alarm. To the operator. All find out find out

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:49.706Z)

Things like a refinance are very nonsensitive

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:49.815Z)

lose this assignment. You know, I So they're no

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:54.226Z)

to an operator. Right? They could care less who the lender is

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:54.475Z)

they need.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:31:57.486Z)

on a hotel, and we refinance all the time.

### You (2025-07-01T16:31:58.295Z)

On not be the best solution.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:00.866Z)

Something like a broker opinion of value on a hotel sale

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:01.255Z)

Now if I gallery of this information, for us. To be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:05.506Z)

that sends up red alarms to the operator. Oh my god. Am I gonna lose this assignment?

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:05.745Z)

you know, as for an owner. Right? Just send out to multiple broker. More

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:10.446Z)

Know what I mean? So there's there is a no depending on what the use is,

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:10.685Z)

funders. Like, for me one spot, that's a lot of time.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:15.056Z)

getting the operator to input the data,

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:15.705Z)

Still. For me. Right? Does that make sense? Sense? Because I'm not

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:17.966Z)

that might not be the best solution. Now if

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:18.195Z)

sending it. To Berends. I'm not sending it to CBRE. And then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:21.526Z)

I am gathering all this information for to me as an analyst for an owner, right, to send out to multiple brokers and

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:21.635Z)

general level and then the to mortgage brokers. But I still want our going here. Like, you know. Whatever. Our plan.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:29.516Z)

mortgage lenders and all. Like, for me to just drop it all in one spot,

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:30.895Z)

To be able figure out a way. If that's totally on. Automated and up into the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:33.856Z)

that saves a lot of time still for me. Right? Does that make sense? Because I'm

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:34.895Z)

system. So that nobody has has to do that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:37.476Z)

sending it to be I'm not sending it to

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:37.915Z)

Yeah. I that the value.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:39.556Z)

CBRE and then JLL, and then I'm sending it to mortgage brokers. But I would

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:39.785Z)

Early on at this point becomes it it it you. Been doing

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:44.496Z)

still want in our

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:44.835Z)

you have to send out

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:45.946Z)

one year, like, you know, our our plan

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:46.005Z)

things. Multiple times. You had to work doing the same work. Over and over and over again.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:50.436Z)

to be able to figure out a way to get that totally automated and up into the

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:51.775Z)

I mean, in this case, many

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:54.416Z)

so that nobody

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:54.435Z)

it's that you you are still too

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:56.006Z)

has has to do that.

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:56.455Z)

work, which you're doing. Once.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:57.456Z)

Yeah. I think the the value

### You (2025-07-01T16:32:57.845Z)

And then it aligns Yes. Exactly. So but it's not gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:32:59.466Z)

early on at this point

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:00.965Z)

I'm trying to figure out how that works.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:00.976Z)

becomes in in in the work you've been doing, you've had to send out

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:02.675Z)

For a practice. Perspective. If I'm the broker,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:05.566Z)

things multiple times. You've had to do the same work over and over and over and over again.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:05.655Z)

I'm listing on hotel for sale, right, I have a offering demo but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:11.366Z)

I mean, in this case,

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:11.735Z)

would need to have you prospective buyer

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:12.976Z)

maybe it's that you you are still doing the work, but you're doing it once.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:13.835Z)

to join and this AI right for this to work, right, because every potential buyer

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:17.316Z)

And then you're doing it once. Yes. Exactly. But I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out how that works.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:18.845Z)

is gonna want their files to be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:21.986Z)

From a practical perspective. If if I'm a broker,

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:22.025Z)

proprietary to them. Right? Because then I can only share pro form a, then I can only share their

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:24.716Z)

and I'm listing a hotel for sale,

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:26.275Z)

start reports.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:27.236Z)

right, I I have a offering memo

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:27.975Z)

Every one uses different star reports. Reports. Right? Because I don't believe

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:30.026Z)

but we would need every prospective buyer

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:31.045Z)

one competitor. Said. Everybody have their own

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:33.266Z)

to join InnVestAI, right, for this to work. Right? Because

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:33.615Z)

capital plan. So yeah, you can try to understand how it actually can work from a a

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:36.766Z)

every potential buyer is gonna want their files to be proprietary to them. Right? Because they're not gonna wanna share

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:40.415Z)

you know, perspective. The things that are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:43.796Z)

their pro form a. They're not gonna wanna share their

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:45.225Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:45.876Z)

star reports. Everyone uses different star reports.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:46.075Z)

the things that are historical, right, that are distinct. Like, if you're if you're looking to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:49.556Z)

Right? There's not only one competitive set.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:50.115Z)

to, you know, go a deal comes to the market, you go to the deal room.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:51.596Z)

Everyone's gonna have their own capital plan.

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:54.015Z)

Right? You download the data.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:54.506Z)

So yeah, you can I'm trying to understand how it actually can work from a a

### You (2025-07-01T16:33:55.825Z)

There's certain set of data that is the same for everybody. Right? All of them have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:33:59.856Z)

you know, practical perspective. The the things that are

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:00.165Z)

Wouldn't every prospective buyer have to be a network of InvestAI? Pay us a fee in order to have access to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:04.846Z)

like, the things that are historical, right, that are the same like, if you're if you're looking to

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:06.295Z)

the system. So the broker would need to know that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:09.546Z)

to you know, you're going a deal comes in the market, you go to the deal room.

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:10.485Z)

you know, we'd have to have universal buying from entire industry for that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:13.646Z)

Right? You download the data. There's a certain set of data that is

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:14.615Z)

to be doable. I mean, I mean, different we can make certain

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:17.386Z)

the same for everybody. Right? All over the Wouldn't every prospective buyer have to be a

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:20.255Z)

areas of the application scenario.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:21.876Z)

member of InnVestAI and pay us a fee in order to have access to

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:22.995Z)

Without being a member. Yeah. So proper then share

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:25.896Z)

the system?

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:26.755Z)

a page or a report

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:27.116Z)

So the broker would need to know that

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:28.645Z)

to you know, these file.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:30.296Z)

you know, we'd have to have universal buy in from the entire industry for that to be

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:31.645Z)

It works now is that, you know, like, RCF, which is a company that a lot

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:34.606Z)

doable.

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:34.755Z)

of brokers use, Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:36.496Z)

I mean, it depends. We can make certain areas

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:36.565Z)

They just distribute information the RCM platform and endless numbers of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:40.716Z)

of the application serial

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:42.145Z)

of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:42.426Z)

being a member. So broker can

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:42.785Z)

prospective buyers log in because they don't to pay

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:45.336Z)

share a page or a report to, you know, this buyer.

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:45.825Z)

the monthly fee. Right? The broker. Paid one fee and then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:50.026Z)

I mean, the way it works now is that, you know, like, RCN, which is a company that a lot of brokers use,

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:50.705Z)

the whole industry can can share. The the file. For free. We would we would we would wanna do something very similar to that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:34:55.576Z)

Right? They just distribute information via the RCN platform, and

### You (2025-07-01T16:34:57.985Z)

So this is this is Yeah. I think yeah. He's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:00.076Z)

endless numbers of

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:01.275Z)

think that data that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:01.626Z)

of prospective buyers can log in because they don't have to pay

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:02.545Z)

into our so that people

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:05.336Z)

the monthly fee. Right? The the broker pays one fee,

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:06.035Z)

could manipulate data. And come to conclusion. In a part visual

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:09.316Z)

and then the whole industry can share the the files for free.

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:09.705Z)

way. The only way that we work. Is that they're paying us the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:13.826Z)

But

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:14.475Z)

monthly kind of subscription. Fee. Yes. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:18.416Z)

But but isn't the essence of our technology, we're to take that data and then put it into our proprietary

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:18.905Z)

to to Vinod's point, we would have, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:23.336Z)

model

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:23.435Z)

I won't say the free version

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:24.506Z)

so that people can manipulate the data and come to

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:25.675Z)

We would just simply give the brokers the ability

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:27.646Z)

conclusions in a more efficient way. But the only way that would work

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:30.065Z)

to create

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:30.666Z)

is if

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:31.155Z)

their OMs and and and valuations

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:35:32.396Z)

they're paying us a monthly or some kind of subscription fee.

### You (2025-07-01T16:35:35.115Z)

using our tool. Right? So that the time savings of them having to go through their Excel mod and then copy and paste and put everything together. You know? What our value benefit to the to the brokers is to cut that time down significantly. And one of the things we've talked about is then once you have all of this in, is the ability to check the boxes. You know, what do I wanna share? With other people, whether it be internally through InnVestAI or externally through an email. What we could do So I guess when you're saying that there would be a base model that's kind of a bell. For Yes. But then that perspective, manipulate. The data. Yep. They would have to pay us fee in order to get access to to play with the model if you will. And and I think there there is a the goal is obviously we get everybody

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:31.626Z)

I guess what you're saying is that there would be a base model that's kind of available for free.

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:31.925Z)

brokers, buyers, sellers, whatever, using this.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:35.846Z)

But then if their prospective buyer or underwriter wants to manipulate the data,

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:36.125Z)

It might I mean, that obviously takes scale and buy in

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:40.796Z)

would have to pay us a fee in order to get access to

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:42.165Z)

which takes time. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:43.796Z)

to

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:44.605Z)

We I'm just trying to think of the path of least resistance, I guess. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:45.476Z)

play with the model, if you will. Yeah. And and I think there there is a

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:48.695Z)

I think STR and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:48.856Z)

the goal is obviously we get everybody

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:50.995Z)

know exactly.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:51.406Z)

brokers, buyers, sellers, whatever, using this.

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:52.015Z)

How it grew to its size. But I'm guessing it started with a single market

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:55.736Z)

I I mean,

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:56.795Z)

And it said, let me get everybody in this market

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:36:58.736Z)

that obviously takes scale and buy in

### You (2025-07-01T16:36:59.765Z)

doing this and then let's go to another market and then another

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:01.776Z)

which takes time. We just trying to think of the path of least resistance, I guess. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:05.005Z)

Uber starts as a taxi service. I'm in San Francisco. Yeah. Frank. Yeah. So I mean, that's the only thing have to be Yeah. Amazon started

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:08.236Z)

I think STR I don't know exactly how it grew to its size, but I'm guessing it started with a single market.

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:12.785Z)

with books. Right? Right. And and grew in it. Other things. Right? So this is what I I know exactly

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:16.666Z)

And it said, let me get everybody in this market

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:18.635Z)

what how we do it,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:19.256Z)

doing this

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:20.225Z)

but I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:20.466Z)

and then let's go to another market and then another Yeah. I mean, listen. Uber Uber started as a taxi service only in San Francisco.

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:20.885Z)

know that there is a we need to find the path of least resistance to get by it from a wine.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:27.476Z)

Right. So

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:27.695Z)

A broad set and then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:29.306Z)

mean, that's literally how they began.

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:29.325Z)

mean, eventually, once you get enough people using

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:31.016Z)

Yep. Amazon started with books. Right? Right. And it then it grew, and it

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:31.345Z)

you know, everybody starts paying for it. I mean, every as we get with STRs,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:34.906Z)

to other things. Right? So this is I I don't know exactly what

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:35.675Z)

perfect as a small, everybody pays for it. Even though everybody has to choose it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:38.566Z)

how we do it, but I know that there is a we need to find the path of least resistance

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:39.855Z)

Right? And they get they get it. Paid for like, from all from all they're getting.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:44.126Z)

to get

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:44.535Z)

The registries from

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:45.086Z)

buy in

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:45.965Z)

both operators and owners.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:46.176Z)

from a wide a broad set. And then if I mean, you think eventually once you get enough people using it,

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:47.385Z)

Customers. You know, it's just insane. So think that may be the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:50.876Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:51.865Z)

easier path. It's just to get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:51.966Z)

everybody starts paying for it. I mean, every as again, like, STRs,

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:53.605Z)

like, you know, the card. Gets the description

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:55.166Z)

perfect business model. Everybody pays for it even though everybody has to use it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:56.925Z)

for InvestAI. They just sent it to you.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:37:59.326Z)

Right? And they get

### You (2025-07-01T16:37:59.775Z)

Information.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:00.356Z)

they get

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:00.395Z)

Part of their

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:01.126Z)

paid from, like, from all from all angles. They're getting

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:01.685Z)

their model. They're paying for. But then in respect

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:04.146Z)

their revenue streams from both operators, from owners, from customers. You it's just it's insane.

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:04.635Z)

buyer wants to use the data to manipulate analyze. It. They would have to pay a second

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:08.846Z)

So But I but I think talking through it, I think that may be the

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:10.165Z)

fee in order to get access

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:11.406Z)

easier path is just to give, like, you know, the broker gets a subscription

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:11.925Z)

Right? New bills, like, read only file. Yeah. Yeah. Unless they pay And then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:16.466Z)

for InnVestAI. They disseminate the information

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:16.665Z)

can reverse the version of it. Only model to it and global model.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:20.246Z)

part of their their model that they're paying for,

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:20.665Z)

Upon payment of fee to us.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:22.796Z)

But then if the prospective buyer wants to use the data and manipulate it or analyze it,

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:24.255Z)

About it, if I think about it is, I mean, how many brokers are there? They really don't big brokers in hospitality. There's five, six. Right? There's no big

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:28.106Z)

would have to pay a second fee in order to get access

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:31.025Z)

10 that are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:31.256Z)

Right? It would be almost like a read only file.

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:32.355Z)

do the majority of the deals.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:33.636Z)

Unless they pay, and then it converts from a read in

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:33.885Z)

If we if we get the 10 brokers or even half of them,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:37.646Z)

only model to an editable model.

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:37.955Z)

to start using this and we make it

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:40.356Z)

Upon payment of a fee to us.

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:40.845Z)

super cheap. Work. Even you know, free for some period of time, they are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:43.056Z)

Another way to go about it, if I think about it is,

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:44.785Z)

if you think about the origin and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:45.176Z)

I mean, how many brokers are there that real you know, big brokers in hospitality? There's

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:46.485Z)

the the flow data, right, the PNLs and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:49.006Z)

five, six. Right? There's probably 10 that are Ten. Really do the majority of the deals.

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:49.565Z)

all these these cellular documents, like, they come through the broker.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:53.126Z)

If we if we get

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:53.815Z)

Broker that distributes them to all these different people.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:54.826Z)

the 10 brokers or even half of them

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:56.625Z)

If we can get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:57.546Z)

start using this

### You (2025-07-01T16:38:57.915Z)

want all those different people on the outskirts, all the potential buyers. We want them to be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:38:59.086Z)

and we'd make it super cheap or even, you know, free for some period of time.

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:02.635Z)

paying. Right? Because because there's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:03.516Z)

They're if you think about the origin and the the flow of data, right, the

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:03.745Z)

way more out them. Right? Get the that brokers do it for free, it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:07.646Z)

PNLs and

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:07.855Z)

say, look. The caveat is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:09.016Z)

all these these seller documents, like, they come through the broker.

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:09.455Z)

get this for free. You have to put it the P and Ls and you have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:13.086Z)

The broker then distributes them to all these different people.

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:13.735Z)

to put in the data. Right? Like, you can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:16.116Z)

If we can get we want all those different people on the

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:16.705Z)

whatever. The preparation have to put. I'm just gonna go I mean, I mean, I really do

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:19.406Z)

all the potential buyers. We want them to be

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:20.445Z)

think somehow we at least in our

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:22.186Z)

paying. Right? Because there's way more of them. Right? If we give if we let the brokers do

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:23.535Z)

first year roadmap. Figure out a way to get that data ingested. Because

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:26.766Z)

for free and say, like, look. The caveat is

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:28.665Z)

there are other ways

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:28.936Z)

get this for free, but you have to

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:30.635Z)

totally here

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:30.946Z)

put in the PNLs, and you have to

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:31.695Z)

represent people I never get Uber started

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:33.886Z)

put in the data.

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:34.465Z)

taxis in San Francisco. I I am completely here.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:35.336Z)

Like, you put whatever the brokers should have to put. I'm just gonna go I mean, I mean, I really do think that

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:37.645Z)

Agree all of that. But there's there's one thing that I

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:40.306Z)

somehow we need to at least in our first year roadmap

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:41.385Z)

should explore for the next couple months, and that is every single loan in The United States Of America needs to be serviced. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:44.346Z)

figure out a way to get that data ingested. Because there are other ways, like and I and I and I totally hear what you guys are saying. Pick

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:48.915Z)

So monthly p and l information is going out to those servicers right now, and it is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:51.796Z)

one market. Uber started with taxis in San Francisco. I I

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:55.035Z)

going out in a very manual format.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:56.026Z)

completely hear and agree all of that. But there's

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:57.565Z)

If all of the state

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:39:59.406Z)

there's one thing that I think we should explore over the next couple months, and that is

### You (2025-07-01T16:39:59.435Z)

alive and exists in our system, system, then it becomes a known issue if the brokers get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:03.516Z)

every single loan in The United States Of America needs to be serviced. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:04.935Z)

do a POV. As the operator no longer has to send it

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:08.216Z)

And so

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:08.255Z)

Does this make sense? Like, we're all Yeah. That's mean, just just to cut it for a second.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:09.256Z)

monthly p and l information is going out to those

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:11.545Z)

You know, not only are we going out manually,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:12.486Z)

servicers right now, and it is going out in a very manual format.

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:13.455Z)

but the bigger concern is that it's going up inconsistently. Right? So there's no, like, scaling a 100 get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:17.436Z)

If all of this data just is live and exists in our system,

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:19.595Z)

you know, a 100 different

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:21.116Z)

then it becomes a nonissue if a broker's gonna do a BOV because the

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:21.535Z)

for data and a 100 different formats from a 100 different borrowers. There's no Only true. Standardized

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:25.786Z)

operator no longer has to send it. Does this make sense? Like, we're already Yeah. And, Diane, just just

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:26.445Z)

So if we can't count the standard, so that when electric gets an InvestAI monthly report from a borrower,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:29.976Z)

to cut in for a second. You know, not only you're going out manually,

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:32.835Z)

they know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:32.996Z)

but the bigger concern is that it's going out inconsistently.

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:33.585Z)

exactly how to manipulate data because it's in a standardized format. I think that's our

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:36.336Z)

Right? So there's no, like, stay like, a lender gets you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:37.735Z)

secret sauce. So you're talking about

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:40.046Z)

a 100 different data in a 100 different formats from a 100 different borrowers. There's no Totally true.

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:40.145Z)

when Like, I So start I know, but, like, so a bunch of our customers use our reports to send to their, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:45.016Z)

Standardized so if we can become the standard,

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:46.805Z)

They're always in different formats.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:40:48.086Z)

when a lender gets an Invest AI monthly report from a borrower, know exactly how to manipulate the data because it's in a standardized format. I think that's our secret sauce. So you're talking about when, like, I Standardization. So start I know that, like, a bunch of our customers use our reports to send to their lenders. They're always in

### You (2025-07-01T16:40:49.775Z)

I mean, they're similar because they're summary p and l, basically. But beyond that, they're know, they're different to two things. Basically, those it's like Wells Fargo over whoever else it is. But right, you're talking about those services right there. For all the it's not even a standard

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:07.786Z)

different formats

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:09.085Z)

p and l. Like, everyone has their own spin on

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:09.206Z)

I mean, they're similar because they're summary p and l, basically. But beyond that, they're, you know, they're different.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:11.015Z)

p and l's and modeling. You know? And now I have one other thing that I personally

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:14.176Z)

So you're saying, basically, those it's like Wells Fargo or

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:15.285Z)

think be humiliating for the loan servicing industry. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:17.576Z)

I don't know, whoever else it is. But, right, you're talking about those service

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:19.735Z)

maybe owners aren't gonna like this, but I'm just gonna say it because it's out there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:20.926Z)

Right? They're Yeah. They probably they probably spend hours just organizing the data they receive.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:23.945Z)

Offer your do

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:24.666Z)

To get it in a format they could actually use it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:24.945Z)

good. Three months forward.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:26.836Z)

Like, if there's not even a standard p and l, like, everyone has their own spin on p and l

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:27.045Z)

Forecast. It's been built into the DNA of our business network. They're graded on it. Right? They are

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:31.536Z)

and modeling.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:32.515Z)

actually internally graded

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:32.516Z)

You know? Then I'll add one other thing that I personally think could be

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:34.395Z)

And come on how well their forecasts are.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:36.076Z)

humongous for the loan servicing industry.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:37.965Z)

Can you imagine how that would

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:39.096Z)

And and maybe owners aren't gonna like this, but I'm just gonna say it because it's out there.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:39.565Z)

improve service if you had some into the few three.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:44.056Z)

Operators do good three month forward

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:44.315Z)

Months. Versus just relying on 12? Oh, that's a problem. It's a

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:47.076Z)

forecast. It's been built into the DNA of our business now. They're graded on it.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:49.975Z)

Right. That's like, you know, our if if it's not part of the long dot requirements, I know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:51.596Z)

Right? They are actually internally graded. And compensated on how well their forecasts are.

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:55.285Z)

operate like, when I was my last ownership they were like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:41:57.906Z)

Can you imagine how that would improve loan servicing if you had

### You (2025-07-01T16:41:58.225Z)

do not the lender or anything. Got it. Got it. Drew listened the and I told him

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:01.826Z)

some visibility into the future three months versus just relying on trailing twelve Well, by the way, that's a perfect application for AI.

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:02.525Z)

just more amazing now. Start with the lending shop. Like you start with the tree or you start with the Milk Light. There's a lot of people that need refis out there right now. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:10.236Z)

Right. That's like I mean, our if if it's not part of the loan doc

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:11.975Z)

They are the group at that moment in time that could say,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:14.396Z)

requirements, I know

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:15.155Z)

oh, and let's be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:15.566Z)

operate like, when I was a

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:16.645Z)

into our

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:16.996Z)

my last ownership group, they were, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:17.255Z)

lockdown that we need the three month Yeah. Forecast. Okay. That's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:18.676Z)

do not give the lender anything. Got it. Got it. Drew listened to it, and I totally understand

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:21.595Z)

you know, alleged lenders are really just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:22.776Z)

But this is where maybe now when you start with a lending shop, like you start with a peach

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:24.145Z)

private equity firms lending them. Yeah. Yeah. They don't even have the expertise that have got my past and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:26.816Z)

tree or you start with a MetLife,

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:29.005Z)

you know, we can show them

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:29.216Z)

There's a lot of people that need refis out there right now. Right? They are the group at that moment

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:30.235Z)

a consistent way to reporting. That make their lives so much easier

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:33.886Z)

in time that could say,

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:34.325Z)

the private equity shops are probably least

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:35.866Z)

oh, and let's bake it into our loan doc that we need the three month Yeah. Forecast. Right? Diane, you have all these, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:36.535Z)

priced. That's it. To pay. Us. Right. So much money. In fees. You know, that life will you know, fight about

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:42.556Z)

alleged lenders that are really just private equity firms lending now.

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:43.585Z)

basis. Points. Yeah. But if we go to, like, know, one of these big TV shops,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:46.086Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Don't even have the expertise that a MetLife has. And, you know, if we could show them

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:47.205Z)

and we make their lives easier, then they're probably not gonna care what they have. I can talk to Ransfield Inn at

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:50.706Z)

a consistent way of reporting, that would make their lives

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:53.205Z)

Access Point Financial in the last couple of months, and both of them, I was like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:53.846Z)

much easier, and and the private equity shops are probably least

### You (2025-07-01T16:42:56.695Z)

talking about how to get the data from the operators. And I was like, we get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:42:56.806Z)

price sensitive to paying us Right. Right? Because they're making so much money in fees. You know, MetLife will

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:00.525Z)

structured data from operators, and both of them

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:02.446Z)

you know, fight about us, fight over basis points. Yeah. But if we go to, like, you know, one of these big PE shops,

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:03.935Z)

I was like, was like, you might have put it in your loan docs. And they were like, well, I don't know. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:07.416Z)

and we make their lives easier, they're they're probably not gonna care what they pay us.

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:08.005Z)

don't like, these loans are already hard to come by. Don't wanna, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:10.826Z)

I I talked to Ramsfield and at

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:11.475Z)

like, I know. Maybe it's sound like

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:13.476Z)

Access Point Financial in the last couple of months, and both of them, I was like we're talking about

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:13.795Z)

like it might be hard. You the more hard that you put in the loan covenants, the the harder it might be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:17.606Z)

how to get the data from the operators, and I was like, we get structured data

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:18.805Z)

get the to be accepted for the loan. I know. But Howard, sorry. Infinite. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:21.796Z)

from operators. And both of them

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:23.145Z)

Sorry. Good. To chime in. Where's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:24.356Z)

was I was like, you might have to put it in your loan docs. And they were like, well, I don't know. Like, we don't

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:25.195Z)

like, going off on a tangent. Yeah. Yeah. This this is definitely a tangent because

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:28.546Z)

like, these loans are already hard to come by. We don't wanna, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:31.255Z)

talking about something

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:31.806Z)

I I know. They made it sound like

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:32.585Z)

quite a bit well, I wouldn't say quite a bit down the road, but let's just say it's down the road.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:34.126Z)

like it might be hard. If you the more requirements you put in the loan covenants, the the harder it might be to

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:36.665Z)

And and you're absolutely right. There's a tremendous amount of value in there, but

get the to to be accepted for the loan. I know.

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:41.425Z)

But but but I'm sorry. But but I think

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:41.796Z)

Howard, sorry. And Vinod, you guys Sorry. Vinod, you guys need to chime in. We're just, like, going off on a tangent,

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:42.955Z)

that the common threat of all this rambling is you know, should we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:46.766Z)

We were getting each other excited.

### You (2025-07-01T16:43:46.955Z)

be picking one target audience to begin with? And, you know, should it be the brokers? Should it be the lenders? Should it be the servicer? Like, oh, are we better off. Picking one path as opposed to trying to be

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:43:59.566Z)

But but but I'm sorry, Kai. But I think the the common

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:00.635Z)

you know, all things to all people they want. Which is probably Yeah. Yeah. More. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:03.966Z)

thread of all this rambling

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:04.825Z)

Yeah. We can't we can't be everything to everybody.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:05.476Z)

is you know, should we be picking one target audience to begin with?

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:07.165Z)

And Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:10.806Z)

You know, should it be the brokers Should it be the lenders?

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:11.125Z)

Should say, like, the three months. We're just gonna try to market ourselves

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:14.226Z)

Should it be the servicers? Like, are we better off

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:15.855Z)

to lenders or to servicers or something.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:17.626Z)

picking one path

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:18.615Z)

Pick one segment

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:19.096Z)

as opposed to trying to be

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:19.915Z)

to build traction because, again, my head is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:21.096Z)

all things to all people day one, which is probably a much more

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:23.265Z)

capitalizing And, you know, we start talking to investors, they're gonna wanna know

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:27.956Z)

right. That's my point. Like like, may maybe maybe you are

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:27.975Z)

who specific is valuing our servants

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:30.916Z)

you know, we should say for, like, the first three months.

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:32.375Z)

And what initial feedback have they given us

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:33.696Z)

We're just gonna try to market ourselves to lenders.

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:35.195Z)

in a we micro focus on one segment of the industry,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:36.896Z)

Or to servicers or so, like, pick one segment

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:38.625Z)

it may be for us to get.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:40.356Z)

to build traction because, again, my head is

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:40.645Z)

More meaning. And impactful feedback. Which will be very helpful in raising

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:43.746Z)

capital raising. And, you know, when we start talking to investors, they're gonna wanna know

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:44.445Z)

capital. No. No. You're you're absolutely right. But let's let's back it up even way before that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:48.516Z)

who specifically is valuing our

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:50.425Z)

Going back to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:51.306Z)

service

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:51.895Z)

know, the discussion of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:53.066Z)

and what initial feedback have they given us. And if if we

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:53.405Z)

Uber and and Amazon and and everything else.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:44:56.316Z)

micro focus on one segment of the industry, it may be easier

### You (2025-07-01T16:44:58.715Z)

We can't even go out with an MVP

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:45:00.206Z)

for us to get more meaningful and impactful feedback which will be very helpful in raising capital.

### You (2025-07-01T16:45:03.295Z)

on unless we can ingest the historical data and automate that processing. If we go out to clients and show all of what I put together so far, but say, oh, well, you know what? You still have to copy and paste your financial statements. It's we're we're we're dead in the water before we even start. So I I completely agree. Yeah. So we we can do it. We can do it, but this is gonna take a lot of cooperation between Drew and Vinod and and, like, you know, how are we gonna get that data right now? We've got it set up already so that we can take the data from Drew and populate the model. But what happens when we go to people who don't use Drew's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:45:41.546Z)

I I completely agree.

### You (2025-07-01T16:45:44.175Z)

services? And, Diane, you and I talked about this last week. It's like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:45:45.366Z)

Well, that's

### You (2025-07-01T16:45:47.935Z)

we do have to have a process in place by the MVP order for a client to say, okay. Well, yeah, I can drag this file up here drop it here, and then in a minute, see all of those cells with the historical data populated.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:08.376Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:08.615Z)

Yeah. And I think Diane, I know your goal is somebody doesn't have to it's like somebody can click a button and it will pull data. We can a great where where we should be aiming to go. And that's where I want my business, you know, to this to go as well. But after five years,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:23.446Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:25.445Z)

you know, still not you know, still not there yet.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:28.046Z)

Yeah. And I think, Diane, I know your goal is

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:28.875Z)

And I know our competitors

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:31.606Z)

somebody doesn't have to it's like somebody can click a button

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:31.805Z)

in the space is the same thing. It's just like everything

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:34.466Z)

it'll pull data.

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:34.755Z)

being so somebody has to email the files to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:36.116Z)

Which is agreed where where we should be aiming to go. And that's where I want

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:38.135Z)

else where they can Yeah. Yeah. And and that's why I'm gonna say

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:41.516Z)

my business, you know, to help biz to go as well. But after five years,

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:42.475Z)

maybe the broker is our first target because the broker will have

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:45.766Z)

you know, still not you know, still not there yet. And

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:48.415Z)

all of that information from the seller.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:50.316Z)

I know our competitors

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:50.755Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:52.026Z)

in the space, it's the same thing. It's like everything is being so somebody has to

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:52.395Z)

If I'm if I've got a hotel and I wanna sell it, I'm gonna reach out to the broker. The broker's gonna say, okay. Give me all of this information. Right? You've got a check

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:46:56.546Z)

email the files to somebody else where they get

### You (2025-07-01T16:46:59.945Z)

list. Right, Mark? I'm sure you've you've got all this information.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:00.096Z)

right. So it's

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:03.405Z)

You compile all that information in order to come up with your own valuation. You'll Right. It's a Yeah. Yeah. So are too late, but they just send you the actual file to get from the client. That that's that's fine. That's that's fine. They can send that file to us. And we upload it. You know, the what I'm saying is that broker would be our first initial point of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:26.406Z)

Right. But typically, the broker like, for a

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:27.985Z)

Right? Our you know, everything would go through the broker.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:30.956Z)

historicals, yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:31.795Z)

The broker would then just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:32.936Z)

Brokers times, the brokers are too lazy to input it, they just send you the actual file they get from the

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:33.265Z)

upload those files, whether it be an Excel spreadsheet, a PDF, or

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:37.876Z)

client.

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:38.085Z)

whatever. All they have to do is drag it into the box and drop it, and we take

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:47:38.386Z)

Well, but they I mean, the the broker yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:47:42.665Z)

file in, and then we do our thing. So that's good. That's place we should be talking about. Using it at first. I mean, I've sent you guys There's there's lots of different PML formats. Usually operator specific, so, you know, Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, as an operator, HEI, Cambridge, Davidson, whatever. Like, they have specific p and l formats from one or two different systems. They all run.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:06.046Z)

I mean, if that's maybe that's the place we should be talking about

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:07.435Z)

The story page of those

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:09.036Z)

using AI first. I mean, I've sent you guys and there's there's

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:10.815Z)

PNLs is usually

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:12.476Z)

lots of different PNL formats. They're usually operator specific.

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:13.995Z)

similar Right? Same

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:16.396Z)

You know, Marriott Hilton Hyatt as the operator, HEI, Aimbridge, Davidson, whatever. Like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:17.685Z)

So, I mean, maybe that I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:21.336Z)

they have specific p and l formats.

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:21.735Z)

that that's the hardest part to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:23.706Z)

From one or two different systems that they all run.

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:24.075Z)

That's why don't we use structured data. We don't even use those P and Ls. Right? We use all structured data

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:28.956Z)

The summary page of those p and l's

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:29.365Z)

that comes in, like, x four green. You know, x export. Text files. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:32.236Z)

is usually

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:33.815Z)

But if you could

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:34.446Z)

similar

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:35.315Z)

create a way to pull the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:36.276Z)

Right? It has the same so, I mean,

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:36.895Z)

from those summary p and l's, I mean, obviously,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:39.656Z)

maybe that I mean, that that's the hardest

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:39.805Z)

that that the one that that I think about it and worry about. It's like, again, there's so many

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:43.576Z)

part to that's why we don't use structured data. Like, we don't even use those p and l's. Right? We use all structured data that comes in, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:47.155Z)

different formats. So it's like, how how does how do you unless you're, like, kind of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:50.576Z)

export or a you know, export

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:51.485Z)

training each one I don't know. I mean, if it'll be so, yeah, they give me

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:52.296Z)

text files. But if you could create a way to pull data from those summary p and l's,

### You (2025-07-01T16:48:56.455Z)

You wanted to say something too. So Yeah. So so, Vinod, let me just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:48:58.706Z)

I mean, obviously, the I mean, the the challenge that I've

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:00.985Z)

kinda segue here.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:01.926Z)

been

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:02.575Z)

To to let you this is how Red IQ started.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:03.856Z)

that I think about and and worried about is, like, again, there's so many different formats.

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:05.175Z)

Red IQ didn't start as a valuation model.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:08.346Z)

So it's like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:08.775Z)

RedIQ started as a document processing tool.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:09.146Z)

how do how does how do you unless you're, like, kind of training each one,

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:12.235Z)

Upload financial statements

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:13.536Z)

I don't know. I mean, Vinod may I know you have your your you wanted to say something too. So

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:14.785Z)

upload rent rolls, extract the data from all these different sources, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:49:18.506Z)

So

### You (2025-07-01T16:49:20.255Z)

It it's the same thing in multifamily. Everybody's financial statement's different. But the what Red IQ did is take all of these documents and then output it into a standardized format. That's all we need to do here too. We we we did it at Rede We're just gonna replicate it here. Yeah. And and so, you know, that's that's what we need. We just you know, just need somebody to send us the file. You know? Email is great, but drag and drop is the best. We would get it. It's so hard when it to and I'm gonna of of I don't know if you call

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:00.296Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:02.805Z)

client, but he he you know, interfaces with them on data. Got their start and then they audit this

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:09.356Z)

This is Howard Vanovu.

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:09.665Z)

business. And so a lot of things that they did maybe everyone does this, and I just just don't know, is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:13.576Z)

How hard would it be to and I'm gonna use an example of

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:14.255Z)

when they when they automated and digitized, then they bought a process for hotel management companies.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:19.256Z)

Autelier, which is Drew knows then their client well, I don't know if you

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:20.325Z)

They audit they digitize it, but then they attach

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:22.906Z)

call him a client, but he he

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:23.295Z)

the underlying document. As

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:25.306Z)

inter interfaces with them on data. They got their

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:25.585Z)

a as a as a source file to the record. Right? Mhmm. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:28.896Z)

start in the night audit business. And so one of the things that they did, and maybe everyone does this,

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:30.115Z)

we were to pull up tuition guys did at Red a doc

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:33.836Z)

and I just don't know, is when they

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:33.915Z)

processing, right, to to to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:35.536Z)

when they automated or digitize the night audit process

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:35.915Z)

underwriting. How hard would it be to initially set up?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:38.976Z)

hotel management companies, they audit they digitize it, but then they attach

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:39.545Z)

Structure of so that that document that got dumped in into whatever would call it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:43.826Z)

the underlying document as a as a

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:44.385Z)

The like, the loading zone. Actually gets

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:47.206Z)

as a source file to the record. Right? So if we were

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:47.855Z)

attached as a file to the underlying rep. Just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:51.366Z)

to pull up and do what you guys did at Red IQ, a document

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:51.795Z)

makes sense so that that user their opinion, their underwriting, and their

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:54.836Z)

processing, right, to to to lead into underwriting,

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:55.505Z)

using our tool. Could click through and actually click through

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:50:57.856Z)

how hard would it be to initially set our structure up so that that

### You (2025-07-01T16:50:59.695Z)

fucking get to the actual p and l and

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:01.536Z)

document that got dumped into whatever you would call it, the

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:01.695Z)

go through the actual P and L. That shouldn't be hard. It's like, just dropping that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:05.916Z)

like, the loading zone actually gets attached

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:06.105Z)

Pipe for some server sake. Maybe I'm using.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:09.236Z)

as a file to the underlying record. Does this make

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:09.325Z)

Proper as

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:12.676Z)

sense so that then a user, if they're in and they're underwriting and they're using our tool,

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:14.415Z)

five.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:17.226Z)

could click through and actually click through and find and get to the

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:18.475Z)

To the data of the size three point. We found

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:21.266Z)

PNL and go through the actual PNL.

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:21.515Z)

we can access it. Wanna link it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:24.206Z)

That shouldn't be hard. It's like just dropping that file to some server, say, if we are using AWS, probably s three.

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:29.025Z)

Right. I really want us to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:31.236Z)

If we are using Azure, there's something called Azure Blob. So that's

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:32.035Z)

reasons. One, it is As I as I think to the future of what this can be. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:35.066Z)

file storage. So we pick it from our application, transport it over to

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:37.165Z)

Like, wanna be able to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:39.286Z)

the AWS s three, put it there. And from there, we can access it any

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:39.615Z)

digitize the part it. Like, creating an art and play with

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:43.356Z)

So wherever you want to link it,

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:43.915Z)

quote doc. Document.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:45.276Z)

link it in the application you want to download or do whatever you want.

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:45.365Z)

You need to provide if you have ever seen, like, what an actual

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:49.046Z)

So that's I re right. I really want us to consider that for

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:49.575Z)

closing looks like. But they take hard hard copies

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:52.216Z)

couple of reasons. One is, as I as I think to the

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:53.355Z)

of thousands of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:55.506Z)

future of what this can be, right,

### You (2025-07-01T16:51:55.695Z)

thousands. And thousands. And thousands of pages and they attach it in the PDF.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:51:58.256Z)

Like, if we wanna be able to digitize and be part of being a like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:00.435Z)

Format. So then is a like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:02.116Z)

creating a marketplace, the closing documents, you'd be

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:04.315Z)

a final of all of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:06.726Z)

don't know if you guys have ever seen, like, what an actual legal

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:07.055Z)

that data. And then further when I think about how we can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:10.406Z)

closing binder looks like, but they take hard hard copies of p and l's

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:11.085Z)

use it, I mean, have a vehicle. Some point. Call it four or five year ago. And I don't

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:15.456Z)

thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages, and they attach

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:15.905Z)

think too far ahead. But if we just set up our structure of the this week right now to help

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:20.156Z)

it in a PDF format. So there is a, like,

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:21.385Z)

auditor. And auditing processing and things like that. And so

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:24.396Z)

a final trail of all of that data.

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:26.275Z)

if if like when you guys were thinking about how do we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:28.736Z)

And then further, when I think about how we can use it,

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:29.635Z)

do that initially over the next couple of months, if there's a way

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:32.266Z)

I mean, we might be able, at some point, call it four or five years out,

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:32.445Z)

we can attach those underlying documents as a record I think it would

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:36.036Z)

I know I'm thinking too far ahead, but if we just set up our structure

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:36.605Z)

really help us in our future in ways that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:39.626Z)

this way right now to help with auditors and

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:39.725Z)

probably can't even understand right now. Yeah. I mean, that's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:43.126Z)

processing and things like that. And so

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:44.065Z)

pretty much. Okay. So yeah. That's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:47.326Z)

if if, like, when you guys are thinking about how we do that initially over the next

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:48.955Z)

you know, a couple of things. Okay? One

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:51.726Z)

couple of months, if there's a way that we can attach those underlying documents as a record,

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:54.785Z)

one feature we want to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:56.396Z)

I think it would really help us in our future

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:57.035Z)

develop. First. Okay? What

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:52:59.706Z)

ways that we probably can't even understand right now.

### You (2025-07-01T16:52:59.945Z)

bring us actually some money. Right? Now. I'm

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:03.006Z)

Yeah. I mean, that's

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:04.635Z)

have one.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:04.846Z)

much doable. Okay. See,

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:05.395Z)

Single dollar to kind of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:06.906Z)

Yeah. I think here are a couple of things. Okay? One is I think

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:09.725Z)

plan. Or, you know, So I was hoping

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:13.486Z)

we have to finalize one exit

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:14.915Z)

for you good. You know, re some

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:16.776Z)

we want to develop first. Okay?

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:16.825Z)

funding. Based on the POC we are doing. But if we are saying

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:20.316Z)

Bring us

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:21.235Z)

then

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:21.336Z)

at least some money. Right now,

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:21.885Z)

we should. No. No. I don't think we're saying

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:23.216Z)

I'm literally blocked. We don't

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:24.885Z)

cannot. In fact, if we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:25.386Z)

have even single dollar to kind of

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:26.135Z)

we should I I don't know if everyone's time is up on the top of the hour, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:28.286Z)

buy any subscription or any platform or, you put

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:29.855Z)

we could turn our conversation to that for a little bit.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:32.026Z)

data in database or anything.

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:32.645Z)

It the if that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:33.836Z)

So I was hoping probably we could, you know, raise some

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:35.255Z)

I just want something. So if

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:37.756Z)

based on the POC we are doing. But if we are saying we cannot,

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:38.305Z)

you know, we need to pull either pull in three to have some sort of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:41.856Z)

then probably we should Oh, no. No. I don't we're saying we

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:42.695Z)

you know, dollars here. Okay? And it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:45.356Z)

cannot. In fact, maybe we should. I I know if everyone's

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:45.885Z)

you know, we could probably pull in some money that's, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:48.376Z)

time is up on the top of the hour, but we could turn our conversation to that for a little bit if

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:48.665Z)

say, a thousand dollars. All of us are 5,000. All of us are, you know, we have something to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:53.346Z)

if if that would be useful to just just one sentence. So Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:55.045Z)

see, I can it's I want it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:58.136Z)

If

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:58.685Z)

good.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:53:59.236Z)

we need

### You (2025-07-01T16:53:59.615Z)

Feature we want to tell. It's my responsibility

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:00.416Z)

to pull either pullings we need to have some sort of

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:02.385Z)

to download.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:03.436Z)

you know, dollars here to kind of at least

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:03.925Z)

Data. Pipeline, whatever you want to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:06.636Z)

we could probably pull in some money. Let's, you know, say a thousand dollars all of us, or 5,000, all of us so that, you know, we have something to

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:07.555Z)

I'll make sure that that is load. Part. We need some sort of you know, funding. In place. But right now, I think they're

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:15.226Z)

see, I can

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:16.425Z)

everything on my laptop that would

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:17.176Z)

it's upon this group to decide which

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:18.085Z)

just reside in my laptop. That won't go

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:20.466Z)

feature we want to develop. It's my responsibility to develop, be that AI

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:21.345Z)

So I think for me, that's the the plot right now.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:24.756Z)

data pipeline, whatever you want to, you know, develop technically.

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:25.925Z)

That I'm not able to buy anything.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:28.406Z)

I'll make sure that

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:29.095Z)

On the platform side. I cannot How much how much money to buy?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:30.026Z)

is developed, but we need need some sort of you know, funding Right now, I can develop everything on my laptop. That would just

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:35.905Z)

I can you the exit number, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:39.176Z)

reside in my laptop. That won't go any

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:39.195Z)

that will depend on. What's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:41.276Z)

anywhere. So I think for me, that's the major blocker right now.

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:42.595Z)

except. Word Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:46.466Z)

I'm not able to buy anything on the platform side. I cannot How much how much money is involved?

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:51.775Z)

That for replication? The interface. That the whole builds, like the the model the projection speed power built.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:54:56.866Z)

I can give you the exact numbers, but

### You (2025-07-01T16:54:57.795Z)

Or or that? If that's what you want, those

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:00.046Z)

that will depend on what's what exactly Is that talk I mean, is it rough idea?

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:00.875Z)

things with that, yeah, we can kind of so I'm

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:04.486Z)

A rough idea of how much is needed?

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:05.195Z)

maybe that. Number right now. So probably let's start

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:06.106Z)

For now, probably, let's say 10 k at least.

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:08.205Z)

10 k at least to kind of boost the application with the database.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:10.416Z)

Are you talking about is that for replicating the interface that Howard built?

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:13.095Z)

Single sign on

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:15.266Z)

Like, the the model, like, the

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:16.195Z)

all these things and then, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:17.266Z)

projections piece that Howard built,

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:17.875Z)

AI and data and all that is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:18.936Z)

or or is that is that If we want to stick with that, yeah, we can

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:20.225Z)

different. Story altogether. That's pretty expensive.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:23.046Z)

kind of

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:23.485Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:24.356Z)

I'm giving very rough number right now. So probably let's start with

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:24.545Z)

Could you guys put together a list of the things that from a technology perspective, they need to go

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:29.036Z)

10 k at least to kind of post the application, build the database,

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:31.465Z)

like, I guess, if if they go into something like this,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:33.106Z)

build the single sign on.

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:33.965Z)

I kinda get, like, some some from my end. I know there's there's the deep model.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:37.076Z)

These things. And then, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:38.025Z)

There's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:38.756Z)

AI and data and all that is different story altogether.

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:38.965Z)

storage, There's user interface, User

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:42.576Z)

That's very expensive. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:43.015Z)

log in. Management, Right? I had for my

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:44.866Z)

Yeah. Could you guys

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:45.825Z)

things. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:46.286Z)

put together a list of the things that

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:47.215Z)

it's like you need to post code somewhere support whatever code.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:49.776Z)

from a technology perspective that need to go

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:50.475Z)

With that. A laptop is to go on some server. So one is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:52.316Z)

like, I guess, that that that go into something like this? Again, like, from from from my end, I know there's

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:53.725Z)

that? Then we a server. To run the application when the the port is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:57.616Z)

there's the data model.

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:58.365Z)

kind of

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:55:58.876Z)

There's storage

### You (2025-07-01T16:55:59.385Z)

quick. That code needs to run somewhere.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:00.976Z)

There's user interface.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:01.385Z)

So that's what we need. It's a DNS server.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:03.256Z)

User login, management, right, and a handful of other things.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:05.115Z)

Few now we need a DNS server.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:07.046Z)

So basic is, like, we need to host code. Some ways a code, whatever code

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:07.855Z)

So at least the for sure. And, you know, based on this

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:11.356Z)

reside in a laptop needs to go on some server. So one is that.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:12.815Z)

basic feature, like, you know, if we want to use

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:14.916Z)

Then we need a server to run the application when

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:15.875Z)

AI. Right? It then that a different story altogether.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:17.936Z)

code is kind of built. That code needs to run somewhere.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:19.345Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:22.306Z)

So that server, we need a DNS server.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:23.995Z)

like, a bunch of pretty rough just so we get a sense of what you need.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:26.256Z)

Few we need a database server. So at least

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:26.865Z)

What should a budget be?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:29.416Z)

these three, four things for sure.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:29.895Z)

I get people say, I'll give you a budget, but you tell me what you wanna do. Right? Yeah. I I saw

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:31.776Z)

And then, you know, based on this basic feature, like, you know, if we want to use

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:36.205Z)

just want to stick to what

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:36.296Z)

AI or anything, then will be a different story altogether.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:39.855Z)

So I'll I'll

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:40.226Z)

But

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:41.035Z)

is hosting.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:43.086Z)

Yeah. I think it would be helpful if we could see a budget, like, a budget or even roughly just so we get a sense of what you need.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:43.215Z)

The application. And server. And probably

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:48.236Z)

Well, I'm sure the budget

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:48.445Z)

few more services so that we can customer expenses.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:49.516Z)

you're but I was I'm guessing what it would say, I'll give you a budget, but you have tell me what you wanna build.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:51.565Z)

Yeah. And and we will have to include

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:54.036Z)

Right? Yeah. That that's exactly I mean, if we just want to

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:54.615Z)

data or document processing. In there. That that's gotta be part of it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:56:57.686Z)

to what we have right now, what Howard has developed.

### You (2025-07-01T16:56:59.185Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:00.726Z)

All I need is couple of servers for hosting the

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:02.295Z)

Restart that. As the basis for putting together, you know, but now how are you guys putting in your budget for that?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:05.366Z)

application and database server.

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:07.815Z)

Yep. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:08.496Z)

And probably a few more services that will incur some expenses.

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:10.275Z)

and then know, we can have a continued conversation

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:12.426Z)

Maybe let's start with that. Could you

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:12.665Z)

there. I think think question for, you know Zaya. March and mine.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:17.656Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:19.665Z)

Big piece is how

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:21.706Z)

Right. Maybe maybe we start with that as the basis for putting together, you know, Vinod, Howard, you

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:22.435Z)

right like again. There was a subfield groups of user. Of of folders that used to tell the

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:26.776Z)

putting together a budget for that, replicating what's in those

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:28.325Z)

that. For

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:29.466Z)

include document storage, and then, you know, we can have a continued conversation from there. I I think the biggest question

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:32.115Z)

concern. Get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:35.546Z)

per, you know, Diane Mark's, and my, you know, tangent for thirty minutes, the next big piece is

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:39.045Z)

pool of looks. Owners.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:41.306Z)

how do we get data

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:42.885Z)

Don't use hotel yet.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:43.406Z)

Right? Like, again,

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:44.595Z)

Was

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:44.656Z)

there is a subset of groups of users of of owners that use Hotel BIS that

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:45.495Z)

That's sweet. Get that data. You know, like

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:49.616Z)

for for which that doesn't you know, that's not a that's not a concern. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:49.905Z)

prompt or 6,000 six thousand and twelve thousand

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:53.456Z)

We can give you the data.

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:54.265Z)

hotels. Right? There's

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:55.206Z)

But

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:55.375Z)

suspended there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:55.736Z)

there's a

### You (2025-07-01T16:57:56.325Z)

System. We can find a way. And and, again, on hotel, we're closed to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:57:56.356Z)

much broader in the short term, there's a much larger pool of of owners, brokers,

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:00.295Z)

forming a partnership with them.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:02.076Z)

sellers, buyers, whatever, you know, that don't use Hotel BIS.

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:02.595Z)

Which would be an opportunity to get

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:05.246Z)

We need to figure out the best way to get that data

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:06.485Z)

data. With the clinical

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:08.626Z)

which could be, you know, like, profit store has 6,000 between 18,000 hotels. Right? And they're in their system. If we can find a way and and, again, on the Hotel BIS side, we're close

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:16.295Z)

can get potential customers to say they done. What we're doing.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:20.856Z)

forming a partnership with them.

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:21.115Z)

Right? Yes. So I think you know, if we can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:23.616Z)

Which could be

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:23.905Z)

sort of map this out on paper, right, like, they they

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:25.456Z)

an avenue to getting a lot of data

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:26.215Z)

the next three months. You know, make

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:27.816Z)

with the click of a button. But but let's also I mean, just to take a step back. Right? What we're trying to do now

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:29.615Z)

entering data ourselves. Like, know, just to get an there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:33.666Z)

is get a working model

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:33.895Z)

Just to show people that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:35.616Z)

so that we can get

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:36.025Z)

works. And then maybe

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:37.756Z)

potential customers

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:37.785Z)

you know, as we build the following then we can

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:39.956Z)

to say they value what we're doing. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:40.125Z)

invest in more. You know? The fifth and way to

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:42.926Z)

So I think

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:43.315Z)

doing it. Right? But right now, we're just

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:43.796Z)

if we could sort of map this out on paper. Right? Like like, maybe for the next three months,

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:44.665Z)

trying to show model. And show what the potential is. And then as we

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:48.736Z)

you know, maybe we're just literally

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:49.455Z)

get support from user

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:50.556Z)

entering data ourselves, like, you know, the old school, just to get it in there.

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:51.095Z)

and ultimately investors, then more money. To do it. Better.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:54.776Z)

Just to show people

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:55.135Z)

More efficient way. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:56.296Z)

that it works,

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:56.545Z)

That that

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:58:57.476Z)

And then maybe, you know, as we build a following, then we can invest in more

### You (2025-07-01T16:58:57.545Z)

so

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:02.096Z)

you know, efficient ways of doing it. Right? But right now, we're just trying to show a model

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:05.485Z)

you know, out the door as quickly as

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:07.006Z)

and show what the potential is.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:07.825Z)

we can. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:09.036Z)

And then as we get support from users

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:09.465Z)

It sounds like there's no perfect solution now for day

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:12.136Z)

ultimately investors, then we'll have more money to do it kind of the more efficient way.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:12.145Z)

putting given our limited resources. So if we just say me, for the first three months, we're gonna take 10 hotels,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:16.876Z)

That that is a route that one of our competitors took, and I think it's

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:17.605Z)

you know, There's five of us Maybe we just literally like, each take two hotel. We just enter the stuff ourselves.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:20.976Z)

But I think that's what we're gonna I mean, to me, it sounds like that's what we're gonna need to do. Right? Because we're all

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:23.505Z)

So you know, the hard way. Just to show

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:25.376Z)

trying to get this

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:25.725Z)

people that it worked.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:26.346Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:26.825Z)

Last week,

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:27.336Z)

out the door as quickly as we can.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:28.305Z)

like, let me just give this idea.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:29.346Z)

Right? And and it sounds like there's no perfect solution now for

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:30.885Z)

I'm there. And and Drew, know them.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:32.636Z)

inputting given our limited resources. So maybe we just say,

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:33.385Z)

Equally well. I'm sorry, Mark. You probably know them. Even better than I do. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:35.756Z)

for the first three months, we're gonna take 10 hotels, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:37.915Z)

Steve Margall is

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:39.256Z)

there's five of us. Maybe we just literally, like, each take two hotels. We just enter the stuff

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:39.765Z)

one of my best mentors in the entire industry. He has helped me

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:43.836Z)

ourselves, the old you know, the hard way.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:44.415Z)

run when I was in my twenties.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:45.796Z)

Just to show people that it works.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:46.595Z)

To today.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:47.676Z)

Or unless we like, let me just give this idea.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:47.905Z)

And so we could get them to agree to help us

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:51.056Z)

I'm there I'm and and Drew, you know them.

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:52.745Z)

like, task the data transfer

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:54.226Z)

Equally well. And I'm sorry, Mark. You probably know them even better than I do. But

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:55.975Z)

system up down.

### Guest (2025-07-01T16:59:58.116Z)

Steve Margall is one of my best

### You (2025-07-01T16:59:58.175Z)

Top. Me. Up down,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:02.036Z)

in the in the entire industry. He has helped me from

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:05.095Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:05.506Z)

when I was in my twenties to today. So what if we could get them to agree to help us

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:11.495Z)

but if we could say Steven John which

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:13.536Z)

like, test the data transfer through Drew's system

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:14.415Z)

just be open because you have I I I think I remember

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:18.366Z)

up into Hotel BIS. Wait. Who did you say? You said

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:18.595Z)

you saying. Start with capital is four, and you're and Hotels, like, or something like that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:21.116Z)

Davidson. Steve Marble and and John Keshay. Marble. I thought

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:23.125Z)

But they'd be, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:25.066Z)

were gonna say one of, like, Mark Woodworth, and then I took me No. No. No. Mark Woodworth is too.

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:25.475Z)

if would be willing we don't know what hotel we don't care what hotel it is.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:30.036Z)

I I love Mark Woodworth. But but if we could say

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:30.085Z)

We only wanna see if Pretty quickly. They could digitally transfer

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:33.686Z)

Steve and John, would you just be open

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:34.595Z)

hotel data information to you.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:36.706Z)

Because you have I I I think I remember you saying Starwood Capital has

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:36.935Z)

And then you put it into the to

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:41.076Z)

four Davidson hotels, like or something like that. But they like, if if

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:42.665Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Like, how quickly can that process just

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:46.046Z)

if they would be willing

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:46.155Z)

to process take?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:47.876Z)

blind, we don't know what hotel we don't care what hotel it is. We only wanna see if

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:47.905Z)

Because that's what I feel like we have to show the industry in we are generally this right now. But in

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:52.866Z)

pretty quickly they could digitally transfer hotel data information to you

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:54.235Z)

anyone would be it's the the people that are gonna go to fundraise. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:00:57.746Z)

and then you put it into

### You (2025-07-01T17:00:58.655Z)

But fundamentally, this is a change. Can take a process

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:01.296Z)

to

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:02.195Z)

that is

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:03.106Z)

InvestAI. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:03.405Z)

labor ious

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:04.256Z)

Yeah. Like, how quickly can that process that ingestion process

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:04.545Z)

and time consuming right now. Digitally. Change it to be like

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:07.986Z)

take? Because that's what I feel like we have to show the industry is

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:08.295Z)

thirty seconds. Of time. I I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:12.266Z)

we are manually doing this right now, but it may be it's

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:13.155Z)

that's something that's been on my mind. Recently. It's trying find one operator who work very

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:16.066Z)

the the people that are gonna we're gonna go to fundraise. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:18.485Z)

impressed with life

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:19.326Z)

But, fundamentally, this is a change. We can take a process

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:19.545Z)

us. Who would be willing to try connected with

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:23.336Z)

that is laborious and time consuming right now and

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:23.695Z)

Drew. So can just show how quickly the data might traverse. I think it's a great I think it's a great idea. Yeah. I agree.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:27.236Z)

digitally change it to be, like, thirty seconds of of time.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:31.535Z)

I think it's David. Maybe a good one too. I have to go tighter the call, but

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:33.036Z)

I mean, that's something that's been on my mind recently is trying to find one operator who we're very good friends with, who likes us,

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:35.155Z)

Okay. Yeah. Sorry. I just jumped suddenly. But, yeah, I think this is all very exciting. So Got

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:41.156Z)

who would be willing to try it, and who's already connected with Drew.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:42.025Z)

should we I mean, there's so much stuff we didn't cover today.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:45.376Z)

So that we can just show how quickly the data could traverse.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:45.395Z)

It's also the July 4. Week. So I guess

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:49.326Z)

Think it's a very good idea. I think it's a great idea.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:50.355Z)

maybe I I just wanna

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:51.576Z)

I agree. I think that Davidson may be a good one to do. I have to go because I know the call, but

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:51.885Z)

propose that. Maybe we should start talking talking. Five people people, yes.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:56.026Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:56.195Z)

Weekly just to try to

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:01:56.886Z)

Yeah. Sorry. I should jump suddenly. But, I think this is all very exciting. So

### You (2025-07-01T17:01:57.405Z)

things forward. I'm done. Just let me know when I know that. Alright. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:01.796Z)

Got it. And should we I mean, there's so much stuff we didn't cover today.

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:02.015Z)

Bye. Bye. Thanks so much, man. Bye. Could do or something. So. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:06.106Z)

Okay. Yeah. I'm I'm wide open all week. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:10.106Z)

I guess maybe I I just wanna propose the idea. Maybe we should start talking

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:12.345Z)

you wanna schedule another one, just pick a day and time.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:14.846Z)

biweekly instead of weekly just to try to move things forward as as

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:15.055Z)

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:30.346Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:33.665Z)

Aware of your having a cocktail over the fourth of July weekend, you might wanna skim through it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:34.586Z)

Got it. Is there is there more stuff we wanna cover now? Because I I could stay

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:37.885Z)

But let me kinda

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:39.556Z)

on as well.

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:39.845Z)

walk you through

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:40.416Z)

Let me see. Well, let me just kinda walk

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:40.935Z)

the history of how I tried to size this opportunity.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:44.816Z)

you guys broadly through some of the research I've done, and then

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:45.225Z)

Kind of factors that influenced me since I did the initial sizing exercise.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:48.796Z)

you have some of the backup that I sent you an email. And

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:50.265Z)

And where I stand now with it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:51.876Z)

so at your leisure, if you have leisure, I don't know, or if you're having a cocktail,

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:52.515Z)

So back in it was like

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:55.946Z)

over the fourth of July weekend, you might wanna skim through it. But,

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:56.355Z)

October of last year, I did

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:02:59.746Z)

let me kind of walk you through the history of how I've tried to

### You (2025-07-01T17:02:59.775Z)

my first sizing exercise to try to understand them. What it is. To

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:03.666Z)

size this opportunity.

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:03.755Z)

to forget if I am using the wrong word here for what the TAM is for

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:06.416Z)

Kind of the factors that have influenced me since I did the initial sizing exercise,

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:08.125Z)

The total addressable market for the opportunity. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:11.376Z)

and where I stand now with it.

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:12.515Z)

so I went through

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:13.716Z)

So back in

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:14.175Z)

in a way that it is. I don't know how much we're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:16.516Z)

it was, like, October of last year,

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:17.095Z)

charge for this product because it's just

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:19.966Z)

I did my first sizing exercise to try to understand what is

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:20.415Z)

up and the air. How much is

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:24.336Z)

and and forget me if I am using the wrong word here, but what the TAM is.

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:24.835Z)

deducted the whole investment. Investment in the street may. On an annual basis? Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:29.006Z)

Right? The total addressable market for this opportunity.

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:30.515Z)

That brokers, equity, and debt broker.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:32.896Z)

And so I went through and the way I looked at it is I don't know how much

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:34.925Z)

It include institutional asset manager and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:37.656Z)

we're gonna charge for this product because it's just

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:39.295Z)

It can include things like how much did your funds cost to prepare and things along

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:41.656Z)

up in the air. But how much fees

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:44.975Z)

those. Lines. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:46.056Z)

does the hotel investment industry make on an annual basis?

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:47.225Z)

so I came up with a range at that point in The United States only.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:50.696Z)

Right? That includes brokers,

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:51.905Z)

That in

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:53.516Z)

equity, and debt brokers. It includes

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:54.055Z)

that we're probably about 1.2 to $2,000,000,000 in

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:03:57.356Z)

institutional asset managers.

### You (2025-07-01T17:03:59.115Z)

fees. That are generated from, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:00.336Z)

It includes things like how much did the OMs cost

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:01.775Z)

hotel hotel transactions, hotel investment

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:04.316Z)

to prepare and things along those lines.

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:05.155Z)

management, institutional investment management, things along those lines. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:07.346Z)

And so I came up with a range. I

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:10.135Z)

Should we look

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:10.696Z)

that point in The United States only that in

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:10.865Z)

at that as just the number of hotels? Right? Because pretty much everyone hotel

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:15.346Z)

that we're probably at about 1.2 to $2,000,000,000 in fees that are generated from, like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:15.735Z)

in theory, should be using our service. Right? Because there's something to be done. Till we set the you know a thousand hotels to see

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:23.036Z)

hotel hotel transactions, hotel

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:23.805Z)

as a simple example. Wouldn't ever

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:26.056Z)

manage institutional investment management, things along those

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:26.735Z)

hotel potentially be a customer? Well, that's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:29.496Z)

lines. Right? But we we what what should we look at TAM as just the number of hotels?

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:30.145Z)

not customer?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:33.656Z)

Hotels? Right? Because pretty much every hotel in theory, should be using

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:36.695Z)

Right? I do think

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:38.826Z)

our service. Right? Be because there's something to be done

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:39.215Z)

need the motel staffs. Yes. We need to have how many hotels are in The United States.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:42.156Z)

So if we said there are, you know, a thousand hotels just to use a

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:42.905Z)

Helping our select service how many are full service,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:45.546Z)

simple example,

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:45.865Z)

And have done that now a couple of times

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:47.266Z)

wouldn't every hotel potentially be a customer?

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:49.015Z)

come up with different numbers.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:50.226Z)

Well, this capacity. Right? Because hotel

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:50.965Z)

But let's say it's somewhere between up north 50,000 to a clear

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:53.386Z)

some point, it'll be sold. It'll be

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:54.485Z)

thousand hotels in The United States. And, again,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:04:55.376Z)

bought. It'll be financed. There'll be a lender. Right. Right? So the two step. I do think we need the hotel stack.

### You (2025-07-01T17:04:58.665Z)

finding out what source I do. I can come up with a different number.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:01.586Z)

Yes. We need to know how many hotels are in The United States, how many are select

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:02.905Z)

Mark, you're absolutely right. We need to understand like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:05.326Z)

service, how many are full service,

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:05.965Z)

the number hotels.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:07.666Z)

And I have done that math a couple of times and come up with different numbers,

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:08.425Z)

But but part of what we're also doing is kind of 116,170 hotels and motels

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:12.386Z)

but let's say it's somewhere between a 150,000 to a 180,000 hotels in The United States.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:17.035Z)

just googled it. Yeah. Yeah. According to I just

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:19.176Z)

And, again, depending on what source I use, I can come up with a different number.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:19.365Z)

world. Yes. Yeah. 160,870

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:24.116Z)

But, Mark, you're absolutely right. We need to understand

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:24.295Z)

three hotel. And hotels. In The US. Right. That's why I get anyone

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:26.706Z)

like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:27.255Z)

between 150 to 180 when I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:27.796Z)

the the number of hotels.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:29.435Z)

when I do this when I've done it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:30.096Z)

But but part of what we're also doing is kind of share

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:31.345Z)

Over past. I don't know, eight months.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:33.696Z)

and 16,873 hotels and motels in The in You just googled it. Yeah. Yeah. According to Ibis World,

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:34.285Z)

But every one of those things, there's there are professional fees, service fees. That are from every

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:41.426Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:41.785Z)

transaction.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:42.446Z)

Are 11 116,873 hotels and motels in The US.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:42.735Z)

Right? And what we're trying to say, I guess what I think of it as, is

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:47.196Z)

Right. And that's why I get anywhere between 150 to 180 when I when I do this.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:47.815Z)

all these feeds and if you believe me, and say it's upward of $2,000,000,000 of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:51.806Z)

When I've done it. Over the past, I don't know, eight months.

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:52.825Z)

fees, mean, I States, are earned. From transactions, right,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:55.876Z)

But every one of those fees, it there's there are

### You (2025-07-01T17:05:57.315Z)

broker fees, It'd be like, when I was at Clariant Partners,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:05:58.696Z)

professional fees, service fees that are earned from every

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:01.885Z)

we had a $3,000,000,000 hotel portfolio. At the time,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:03.276Z)

transaction. Right? And what we're trying to say it I guess, what I think of it as

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:07.115Z)

billion was 10% of clearing total AUM of 30 We are

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:08.736Z)

is all these fees, and if you believe me and say it's upward of

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:12.875Z)

in 1% institutional asset management fee on the value of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:13.106Z)

$2,000,000,000 of fees in The United States, are earned from transactions. Right? Broker's fees,

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:18.765Z)

that hotel portfolio.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:19.936Z)

It the like, when I was at Clarion Partners,

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:20.445Z)

So we earned $3,000,000 of fees

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:23.336Z)

we had a $3,000,000,000 hotel portfolio.

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:26.615Z)

on that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:27.726Z)

At the time, 3,000,000,000 was 10% of Clarion's total AUM of

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:28.085Z)

port hotel fees only. On that. Portfolio. 3,000,000.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:32.696Z)

30. We earned 1% institutional asset management fee on the value

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:34.135Z)

Total revenue or total number of hotels? It could be both. It's structured on the on the institutional asset management

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:39.746Z)

of that hotel portfolio. So we earned

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:40.405Z)

side. The more institutional you are, the more

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:44.126Z)

$3,000,000 of fees

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:44.335Z)

based off of. Value. The less institutional you are, the more

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:48.596Z)

on that port hotel fees only on that

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:49.075Z)

based off of total revenue of the portfolio.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:52.036Z)

portfolio. 3,000,000.

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:53.595Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:53.836Z)

Your fee is based on on

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:54.505Z)

So, like, we'll be clearing partners. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:55.546Z)

total revenue or on on total number of hotels?

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:56.935Z)

Because this is the pain point of trying

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:06:57.866Z)

It can be both. It's structured on the on the institutional asset management side

### You (2025-07-01T17:06:58.775Z)

solve. We had zero tools for digitalization to do our work. We had

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:02.446Z)

The more institutional you are, the more it's based off of value.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:04.855Z)

Excel, We had this. Full

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:07.416Z)

The less institutional you are,

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:07.585Z)

that people like, in the nineteen nineties called

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:09.936Z)

more it's based off of total revenue of the portfolio. I didn't realize that that's interesting.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:10.595Z)

RealBridge that we were afraid was gonna break every single day. But so, like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:14.816Z)

Interesting. Mhmm. So, like, now look at Clariant Partners. Right? Because this is

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:15.495Z)

that $3,000,000 there should be some sort of technology

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:19.126Z)

pain point I'm trying to solve. We had

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:21.095Z)

allocation

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:21.906Z)

zero tools or digitalization to do our work. We had Excel.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:22.125Z)

against that. Like, other industries spent upward of 11% of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:27.236Z)

We had this old rickety system that had been built, like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:27.395Z)

their of their total revenues and technology related fees.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:30.346Z)

in the nineteen nineties called RealBridge that we were

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:32.405Z)

Whereas

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:33.366Z)

afraid was gonna break every single day. Right? So, like, that

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:33.405Z)

in real estate, and in real estate hospitality, we're spending nothing. To zero. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:37.376Z)

$3,000,000, there should be some sort of technology

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:38.205Z)

Zero. Right? So that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:42.346Z)

allocation against that. Like, other industries spend

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:42.585Z)

that is how I initially went about it. And now I'm trying to go back through and say,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:46.506Z)

of 11% of their

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:48.235Z)

what I left out was

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:49.696Z)

of their total revenues in technology related fees.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:49.785Z)

the mortgage. Lending. Piece. And a big way. When I first did this,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:53.976Z)

Whereas in real estate and in real estate hospitality, we're spending nothing.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:55.025Z)

And then, second, I also left out the fact that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:58.246Z)

Zero.

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:58.315Z)

what I tried to conclude it,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:07:59.026Z)

Absolutely zero. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T17:07:59.795Z)

but the seat compression that broke

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:02.686Z)

So that that is how I initially went about it.

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:03.545Z)

experiencing right now is pretty significant. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:06.786Z)

And now I'm trying to go back through and say because what I left

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:07.465Z)

owner because in markets will fall into your like, you'll understand this.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:10.376Z)

out was the mortgage lending piece in a big way when I first did this. And then second, I also left out the fact that

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:12.245Z)

It probably into burn in your DNA. There haven't been a large lot of hotel large hotel transactions happening.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:19.746Z)

I tried to include it,

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:20.285Z)

So right now, basically,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:21.286Z)

but the, fee compression

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:23.245Z)

a broker gets a listing,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:23.476Z)

that brokers are experiencing right now is pretty

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:24.745Z)

for a large hotel, it's probably a

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:26.846Z)

significant. Right? Like, owners, because

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:26.935Z)

around forty to forty three

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:29.866Z)

and, Mark, this will fall into your like, you'll understand this

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:29.905Z)

which that that's low. Right? Used to be much, much higher than that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:33.486Z)

It probably into burned into your DNA, but there haven't been a larp

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:34.755Z)

And what I hear used to be the point posted at seven fee.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:37.796Z)

lot of hotel large hotel transactions happening.

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:38.235Z)

Point plus an incentive Right. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:41.386Z)

And so right now, basically, if a broker gets a listing

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:42.215Z)

between the four of us, my friend, Theresa Rose, who's the chief operating officer for CBRE.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:46.266Z)

a large hotel, it's probably around 40 to 43 bps.

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:48.055Z)

Hotels. And she came from the Southeastern Region. She's not a hotel person by background.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:51.176Z)

Which that that's low. Right? It used to be much, much higher than that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:54.355Z)

But she makes basically belong to me last

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:56.026Z)

And what I'm hearing Used to be a point plus an incentive fee.

### You (2025-07-01T17:08:57.355Z)

Monday that least still is

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:08:59.836Z)

Point plus an incentive fee. In the good old days.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:00.505Z)

bombing all listing.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:02.266Z)

Right. So between the four of us, my friend, Darice Rose, who's the chief operating officer for CBRE Hotels,

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:03.375Z)

And they're dropping down into, like, the forty fifth price range. But what's happening is the parent platform is pushing that fee compression on the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:10.436Z)

and she came from the Southeastern Region. She's not a hotel person by background.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:13.085Z)

individual brokers and not absorbing any of it themselves. And so the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:15.826Z)

She basically bemoaned to me last

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:18.025Z)

brokers are all open arms because

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:18.806Z)

Monday that Eastell is buying all its

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:20.135Z)

they're making like, virtually nothing. Now on hotel sales. Especially

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:23.446Z)

listings, and they're dropping down into, like, the 40 bp pricing range.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:24.965Z)

since a lot of the big hotels aren't actually transacting. So I do think, like, strategy

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:29.996Z)

What's happening is the parent platform is pushing that fee compression onto

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:32.405Z)

like, like because so

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:34.546Z)

individual brokers and not absorbing any of it themselves.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:34.725Z)

and I know we're just talking. Right? But I'm trying to give you some of the background the last couple of years and how I've tried to figure this out.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:38.676Z)

And so the brokers are all up in arms because they're making, like, virtually nothing now on hotel sales.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:42.075Z)

I was in CBRS, sat in a a room once with 10 Sother.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:45.556Z)

Especially since a lot of the big hotels aren't actually transacting.

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:46.265Z)

And Tim Souther is very anti technology very anti

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:50.436Z)

So I do think, like, some strategy, like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:51.005Z)

technology from a brokerage perspective. The yield constraint

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:54.656Z)

like because so and I know we're just talking. Right? But I'm trying to give you some of the

### You (2025-07-01T17:09:54.995Z)

side, the hand how does this put money into my pocket?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:09:59.506Z)

over the last couple of years as as how I've tried to figure this out.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:00.045Z)

Pocket. Right? Not CBRE's pocket. Tim's pocket.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:03.546Z)

I was at CBRE, I sat in a room once with Tim Southard.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:03.975Z)

Unless you can show me that, I I don't care about it. Flat out, I just don't care about it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:07.796Z)

And Tim Sothard is very anti technology.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:09.895Z)

So I see I just

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:11.206Z)

Very anti technology from a brokerage perspective.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:11.255Z)

wanna plant that seed for us because somehow

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:14.706Z)

And he looked me straight in the eye and said, Diane,

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:14.905Z)

if this compress like brokers

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:17.776Z)

how does this put money into my pocket?

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:18.235Z)

We have to figure out a smarter, faster better, more profitable way

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:20.906Z)

Tim's pocket? Right? Not CBRE's pocket.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:22.225Z)

for brokers to do business so that they

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:24.216Z)

Tim's pocket. And unless you can show me that,

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:24.465Z)

eat right. Can start to get

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:27.416Z)

I I don't care about it.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:27.535Z)

some of this fee revenue

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:29.016Z)

Flat out, I just don't care about it. So I think I just wanna plant that

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:29.825Z)

back into their pockets. And I had a lot of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:33.506Z)

seed for us because somehow,

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:34.255Z)

market was better, but I don't know what the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:36.546Z)

if this compress if, like, if brokers we have to figure out a smarter, faster, better, more

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:37.075Z)

big firms are offering in firms in terms of like, technology and usage. But it doesn't seem to be enough that it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:42.916Z)

profitable way for brokers to do business so that they, right,

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:44.495Z)

solving this industry problem that they're facing.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:46.906Z)

can start to get some of this

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:47.175Z)

Well, that that's why I I think that I mean, that's a

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:50.106Z)

fee revenue back into their pockets. And

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:51.095Z)

very concern. I think part of the answer to that is that you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:54.746Z)

I and, Mark, you'll know this better, but I don't know what

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:55.115Z)

our tool the broker firms will lead less

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:58.176Z)

the

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:58.265Z)

and and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:10:58.626Z)

big firms are offering in firms in terms of, like, technology and usage.

### You (2025-07-01T17:10:59.765Z)

analyst. Right, because we're gonna make the process more efficient. So now it's gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:03.326Z)

But it doesn't seem to be enough that it's

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:04.215Z)

10 types much work. Because the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:05.986Z)

solving this industry problem that they're facing.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:06.265Z)

our tool. It's make them more efficient. It also now we'll have the analysts to be

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:08.946Z)

Well, that that's why I I think that I mean, that's a very big concern, and I think

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:11.015Z)

you know efficient after it actually think about ways to structure things.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:14.186Z)

part of the answer to that is that

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:14.265Z)

Because they wanted to do the basic inputs

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:16.176Z)

with our tool,

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:17.665Z)

I also think

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:17.686Z)

the brokerage firms will need less

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:18.285Z)

that that our better audience

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:20.086Z)

analysts, right, because we're gonna make the process more efficient. So

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:20.665Z)

could very well doing that. Lenders. Because Yeah. You know, deals have gotten bigger.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:24.786Z)

analyst can do 10 times as much work,

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:25.085Z)

They run pressure to really monitor these

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:27.246Z)

it's our tool is is making them more efficient.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:27.735Z)

problems. You know, have to be monitored by

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:30.266Z)

It will also allow the analysts to be, you know, more efficient, have time to actually think about ways to

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:30.875Z)

monthly, quarterly, annually. They have to have a list. Projections. Under understand market trend. Market

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:35.086Z)

structure things because they won't have to do the basic inputs.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:35.885Z)

data. To some supply. How do we tell the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:38.486Z)

But I also think that that

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:38.575Z)

performing. You know, how the debt service

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:40.346Z)

our

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:40.765Z)

coverage ratio is being met.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:41.256Z)

better audience

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:42.325Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:42.486Z)

could very well be the lenders because

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:43.095Z)

So so the lenders are really

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:44.466Z)

you know, deals have gotten bigger.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:45.035Z)

most analytical from a monetary

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:46.686Z)

They were under pressure to really monitor these loans.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:48.085Z)

monitoring perspective. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:49.966Z)

You know, the loans have to be monitored monthly, quarterly, annually. They have to have all these

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:50.305Z)

so many lectures today or not the traditional lenders that Diane, you and I used to work

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:54.516Z)

projections. They have to understand market trends, market data, new supply.

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:55.615Z)

with. Right? And they're the Right. Private equity guys that are pretending to be lenders because they're getting

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:11:59.006Z)

How the hotels are performing,

### You (2025-07-01T17:11:59.865Z)

tons of money. Lots of money and interest.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:00.946Z)

you know, how the debt service coverage ratios are being met,

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:02.065Z)

But they don't necessarily have their hotel knowledge.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:03.886Z)

Right? So so the lenders are really the most

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:04.485Z)

To really efficiently monitor these loans.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:07.016Z)

analytical

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:07.155Z)

So I think that we

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:08.236Z)

from a monitoring perspective

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:09.105Z)

can probably provide the most

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:10.786Z)

And so many lenders today

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:11.105Z)

value weighted to the private

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:13.426Z)

are not the traditional lenders that, Diane, you and I used to work with. Right? They're they're the Right.

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:13.555Z)

equity fund lending community. And in my before, I just probably least

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:18.396Z)

Private equity guys that are pretending to be lenders because they're getting

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:18.515Z)

sensitive to our fees. Because they're making so much money

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:21.566Z)

tons of money they're making lots of money in interest, but they don't necessarily have their hotel knowledge

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:23.095Z)

And that they just wanted a picture of him. And they wanted to make mistakes.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:26.716Z)

really efficiently monitor these loans.

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:27.015Z)

Right. So that brings me maybe to another idea that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:29.256Z)

So I think that we could probably provide the most value add

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:31.655Z)

I thought about over the past week.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:33.896Z)

to the private equity slash lending community

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:34.665Z)

And that is let's just say we were to find

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:37.436Z)

and

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:37.615Z)

enterprise client or upload

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:38.116Z)

as I mentioned before, they're probably least sensitive to our fees

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:39.905Z)

pause that I enter client. Let's say Peachtree.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:41.936Z)

because they're making so much money.

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:42.725Z)

Right? Because they're a lender and they're sophisticated. Right? And and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:45.066Z)

That they just want an efficient path, and they wanna not make mistakes.

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:46.765Z)

and all that. I have a good relationship.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:49.056Z)

Right. And so that brings me maybe to another idea that

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:49.445Z)

With them. Okay. So what if we were to go at them and say not at them, but that's not a good word. But what if we were to pitch them and say,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:53.516Z)

I thought about over the past week, and that is

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:57.045Z)

would you consider a

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:12:57.436Z)

let's just say we were to find an enterprise client or

### You (2025-07-01T17:12:58.905Z)

three month consulting assignment

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:01.056Z)

I'll call it a quasi enterprise client, like, let's say Peachtree.

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:01.495Z)

with us, where you pass consulting fees and we come in

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:04.726Z)

Right, Mark? Because they're a lender and they're sophisticated. Right? And and Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:04.875Z)

and try to clean up your data, like like improve the way

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:08.676Z)

And all that. I have very I have good, very good relationship with them.

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:08.765Z)

right, and that at the end of three months, if we're all happy,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:11.646Z)

Okay. So what if we were to go

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:12.965Z)

that consulting revenue convert

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:14.416Z)

at them and say not at them, but that's not a good word. But what if we were to pitch them and say,

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:15.225Z)

into an equity interest in InvestAI.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:19.116Z)

would you consider a three month assignment with us where you pass consulting fees in week

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:19.975Z)

Because I've been reading the that is actually a more common path. For technology companies that we might be realizing

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:26.626Z)

come in and try to clean up your data, like like, improve the way

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:27.475Z)

is that have clients you start

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:31.086Z)

Right? And then

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:31.245Z)

at as a consultant. And then,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:32.696Z)

at the end of three months, if we're all happy, that consulting revenue converts

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:34.505Z)

once you got because that would give us an infusion of some cash to get the note in our

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:37.666Z)

into an equity interest.

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:40.305Z)

like, some money to do some of the things

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:40.536Z)

In InnVestAI.

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:42.205Z)

they need to do.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:42.376Z)

Because I've been reading that that is actually a more common path

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:44.185Z)

It we were very attentive to Peachtree's needs, I'm sure we could create the product

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:47.016Z)

for technology companies than we might be realizing is that

### You (2025-07-01T17:13:49.375Z)

that they need, And then

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:13:51.026Z)

you have clients and you start as a as a consultant And then once you've got because that would give us an infusion of some cash.

I love that you're working with someone like Peachtree. The one that's I have about taking money from them.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:06.886Z)

If we were very attentive to Peachtree's needs, I'm sure we could create

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:07.325Z)

Is that the world is so competitive that we have a big tree as an

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:11.166Z)

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:16.785Z)

If we just get Greg Friedman you know, CEO be free or something there,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:25.026Z)

working with someone like Peachtree.

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:25.275Z)

So we have their

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:26.936Z)

The one concern I have about taking money from them

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:27.055Z)

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:29.896Z)

is that

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:30.885Z)

investors and and get the money we need.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:31.216Z)

the world is so competitive that if we have Peachtree as an investor,

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:32.725Z)

But I just working that if we align ourselves with one lender One.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:34.946Z)

does that preclude us from getting BERKADIA and the other 20 lenders? If we could just get Greg Friedman, you know, who's CEO of Petri or someone there, to

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:37.055Z)

To make other lenders nervous about invest or using us. Okay. Concern. That that's an actual

say they love working with InnVestAI,

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:43.965Z)

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:46.036Z)

that's our ticket to raising money.

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:46.345Z)

But but we have between as a client.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:47.896Z)

So if we have their support,

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:48.035Z)

And that's our ticket to raising as much money as we need.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:50.246Z)

we could then go to

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:50.755Z)

### You (2025-07-01T17:14:55.975Z)

Will be like if we have that letter, we'll be able to write

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:14:59.446Z)

make other lenders nervous about

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:00.685Z)

Okay. Sure.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:01.486Z)

investing or using us?

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:02.385Z)

And then I have one more idea that I'd just like to float to you, and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:03.366Z)

Okay. That that would be my only concern. But that's the next

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:06.565Z)

this is all of hotel speak.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:06.736Z)

That's an excellent concern, Mark. It is an excellent But but if we could get Petrie as a client,

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:07.975Z)

So I'm sorry to have another hour on this. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:10.796Z)

you're doing from a technology perspective. You're ahead of the path. I've been trying

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:34.676Z)

one of my someone recommended this to me lately, and they said,

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:37.235Z)

build these relationships. My friends said it,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:39.936Z)

because I have been thinking about this as

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:40.805Z)

Diane be very careful about that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:42.476Z)

go to the people in the hotel industry who like

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:43.185Z)

Because what could happen is one of these groups could take your ID

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:45.426Z)

technology, who believe in technology. Right?

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:47.335Z)

idea go implement it on their own and leave you high and dry.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:48.956Z)

So I have been courting Carlos Rodriguez junior for, like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:52.335Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:52.416Z)

eighteen months to be to, like, you know, like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:52.975Z)

we were talking specifically because I was asking, like, well, could MCR be an

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:55.676Z)

I really like what you're doing from a technology perspective. You're ahead of

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:57.255Z)

investor? You know, they bought lot of and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:15:58.936Z)

the pack and trying to build these relationships.

### You (2025-07-01T17:15:59.705Z)

hotel management.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:01.216Z)

My friend said, Diane, be very careful about that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:01.805Z)

A PMS system, it was that it example that my friends said,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:05.846Z)

Because what could happen is one of these groups could take your idea

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:06.105Z)

oh, oh, be fair. Be clear of that. Right? Because they will be

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:10.546Z)

and go implement it on their own and leave you high and dry.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:10.815Z)

high and dry. But we can I I deserve as well?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:14.976Z)

And we were talking specifically because I was asking, like, well, could MCR be an

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:15.115Z)

Okay. So but what they said, it's instead of them, it is why don't you for your

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:19.916Z)

investor? You know, they bought an a hotel management

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:20.145Z)

very first tier of money, go to a friends and family group,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:23.866Z)

a PMS system. And it was that example that my

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:25.085Z)

like Rob Klein. Steve Casella,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:28.116Z)

friend said, oh, be very leery of that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:28.785Z)

John Klein. Right? Like, I mean, these are the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:31.856Z)

Right? Because they will leave you high and dry.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:33.025Z)

that I have to have in my role next other than Rob Klein.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:35.266Z)

Yeah. But that would my that would be my concern as well.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:37.345Z)

But people

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:37.956Z)

Okay. So what they said instead of that

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:38.835Z)

that are in the hotel industry have made a lot

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:41.006Z)

is why don't you, for your very first tier of money, go to a friends and family group like

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:41.765Z)

money who would love to be part of this, can right check for 50 k or something like that? And we could raise

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:48.926Z)

Rob Klein, Steve Casalica, John Klein. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:49.675Z)

at least a couple 100 k to get us started

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:53.686Z)

I mean, these are names that I that they're not in my Rolodex.

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:54.025Z)

of people that are not technology oriented, but have some money in

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:16:58.116Z)

Other than Rob Klein. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:16:59.155Z)

will be in the hospitality sector. What are your what are your thoughts on that? Yeah. I I think that could work. But, you know, I we have to be very careful about who they are because you know, people talk and you know, we have to try to get far enough along kinda have first mover advantage.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:00.796Z)

people that are in the hotel industry who've made a lot of money who would love to be part of this, could maybe write a check for 50 k or something like that, and we could raise at least a couple 100 k to get us started. Of people that are not technology oriented but have some money and believe in the hospitality sector.

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:21.845Z)

Mhmm. And you know, until we have a product

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:24.576Z)

What are your what are your thoughts on that?

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:24.635Z)

that that's fully to go. Just worried that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:28.316Z)

Yeah. I I think that could

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:28.485Z)

we can give someone the idea, and we could, you know, build competition.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:31.396Z)

work, but, you know, I think we have to

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:33.455Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:33.766Z)

be very careful about

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:34.375Z)

that be my way. Biggest concern.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:35.846Z)

who they are because

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:36.935Z)

And I hear all of them, but we really do need to figure out a way

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:37.656Z)

you know, people talk and you know, we just have to try to get far enough along that we kinda have first mover advantage.

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:41.365Z)

to get some sort of funding into this because I feel like we've gone almost as far as we can go.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:44.766Z)

Mhmm. And know, until we have a product that's that's

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:47.125Z)

Without having a lifeline to get us through the next

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:48.346Z)

fully ready to go, I just worry that

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:50.745Z)

three months.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:51.316Z)

we can give someone the idea and we could, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:51.975Z)

Things that Benaud is talking about

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:54.046Z)

build competition.

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:54.745Z)

I can't just some

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:56.376Z)

So that would be my my

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:57.385Z)

infusion of cash

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:58.686Z)

biggest concern.

### You (2025-07-01T17:17:58.995Z)

because I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:17:59.826Z)

And I hear all that, but we really do need to figure out a way to get

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:00.265Z)

we're all working for free. Right? And and we

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:04.466Z)

some sort of funding into this because I feel like we've gone almost as

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:04.785Z)

need to figure out who we go to to get that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:08.446Z)

far as we can go without having a lifeline to get us through the next

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:08.895Z)

Thing is that, you know, we get a couple of thousand dollars from people, you know, they're gonna want

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:13.386Z)

three months. The things that Vinod is talking about,

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:13.625Z)

real It's not a price. For the company. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're gonna want part of the company. Yes. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:17.746Z)

I mean, just some

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:19.895Z)

part.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:20.296Z)

infusion of cash because

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:20.315Z)

Big part. This is the highest risk capital.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:22.586Z)

I mean, we've all been working for free on our laptops. Right? And

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:22.605Z)

Right? Yeah. You know, we think it's it's just a risk reward thing. We have to just

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:26.606Z)

and we we need to figure out who we go to to get that

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:26.945Z)

think about. You know? I I I get the sensitivity. I I am sensitive. To it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:30.586Z)

Yeah. Because the other the other thing is that, you know, we get

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:31.485Z)

But but they would've be less astute to that than

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:33.146Z)

a couple $100,000 from people, you know, they're gonna want

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:35.155Z)

a really astute

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:36.776Z)

real This kind of price. Part of the company.

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:37.355Z)

angel investor. Both think about less than people that we can talk to. Mean, maybe

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:39.876Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're gonna want part of the company. Yes. But not part. Like, a big part. Right? Because this is the highest

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:41.775Z)

you know pick someone like Kevin. We really

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:44.846Z)

risk capital. Right? And, you know, it's again, it's just a it's just a risk reward thing

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:46.125Z)

trust. And get them to some of the NDA.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:49.426Z)

we have to just think about it. You know? Again, I I get the sensitivity. I I

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:49.875Z)

You know, it's kinda do some of the stuff that just gives us an added level of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:52.976Z)

I'm sensitive to it. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:53.935Z)

something.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:55.026Z)

But they may be less astute to that than

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:55.535Z)

But you know, before we talk people, like do maybe think

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:18:58.046Z)

a really astute angel investor.

### You (2025-07-01T17:18:58.555Z)

about it a little. And and see if there's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:01.746Z)

Well, let's think about a list of people that we could talk to. I mean, maybe you know, do you think someone like Kevin would

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:02.255Z)

some people which also really just think about them. Put on paper. What we really

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:06.606Z)

be in the list? We have Yeah. You know, people that we really trust.

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:07.875Z)

needed. Terms of capital and then you know,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:09.966Z)

And, you know, maybe we guessed them to sign an NDA and

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:10.145Z)

about that. Before. Should really try to spend

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:13.166Z)

know, just kinda do some of the stuff that just gives us an added level of

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:13.415Z)

some time. Mapping out, like, what our real needs are. For the next six months because I can

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:17.626Z)

something. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:19.795Z)

tell you.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:19.826Z)

before we talk to these people, let's maybe think about a list.

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:20.255Z)

Definitively. This money

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:22.586Z)

And Okay.

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:22.655Z)

we're gonna make the first round of money

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:24.116Z)

And see if there's

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:24.175Z)

you know, gonna it's most

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:25.726Z)

some people. And we should also really just think about and put on paper

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:26.155Z)

expensive at the beginning. Because you know, that's the company has no real

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:30.046Z)

what we really need in terms of capital. I mean, I know, you know, we know throughout that

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:31.075Z)

economic value. Right? Yeah. Is sweat equity in the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:33.906Z)

$10,000 number before, but we should really try to spend some time

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:34.965Z)

above. But investors aren't gonna ask.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:37.696Z)

mapping out, like, what our real needs are.

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:38.005Z)

For for a real thing. Company.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:40.076Z)

For the next six months because I can should tell you definitively

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:40.105Z)

And you know, wanna try to bring the low as we need. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:44.956Z)

this money that we're gonna raise the first round of money, you know, is gonna

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:45.825Z)

And so I spent some time trying to put mean, this isn't a high level.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:48.396Z)

it's most expensive at the beginning.

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:49.195Z)

Budget. I think it's over

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:50.696Z)

Because, you know, that's when the company has no real

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:51.315Z)

overstated in their early comments.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:54.506Z)

economic value. Right? We have all this sort of

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:56.145Z)

But I mean, we I mean, we're

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:19:57.526Z)

equity and but but investors are gonna

### You (2025-07-01T17:19:59.095Z)

to the point

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:00.056Z)

ask for for a real stake in the company.

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:01.135Z)

keep calls cover some of our technology Right? We're gonna have to start traveling.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:03.956Z)

And, you know, we wanna try to raise as little as we need.

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:05.835Z)

At some point. To try to mean, to try to

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:08.406Z)

Right. And so I spent some time trying to put

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:09.555Z)

pitch this and go to conferences and things like that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:11.426Z)

I mean, this is of a high level budget, and I think it's overstated in the early months.

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:12.635Z)

We're gonna need to create an actual logo. We're gonna need some

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:16.336Z)

Understated probably maybe in the later months. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:16.495Z)

money. Too. For, like, legal and things.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:20.236Z)

I mean,

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:20.255Z)

Like that. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:21.116Z)

we I mean, we're gonna to Vinod's point and Howard's point, we're gonna need cost

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:22.085Z)

I don't think it's necessary necessarily 89, I don't think it's $89,000 a month to begin with.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:25.156Z)

to cover some of our technology. Right? We're gonna have to start

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:27.805Z)

But I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:28.686Z)

traveling at some point to try to I mean,

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:28.945Z)

I really tried think about this as say, alright. What is it gonna

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:32.306Z)

to try to pitch this and go to conferences and things like that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:32.775Z)

take? Two years? And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:36.226Z)

We're gonna need to create an actual logo. We're gonna need some money

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:37.285Z)

work. But we may need SOC two compliance too. It's so starting around year one.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:40.956Z)

to for for, like, legal costs and things like that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:42.465Z)

We might need to start to pull some of that.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:44.636Z)

So I don't think it's necessarily 89 I well, I don't think it's 89,000 a month to begin with, but I

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:45.055Z)

Cost estimates for SOC two given how big this could be this essentially sums to, I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:52.596Z)

I've really tried to think about this and say, alright. What is it gonna take in two years

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:53.415Z)

put it together like this. And it's sums to a total of 2,800,000.0 over twenty four months.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:58.056Z)

And

### You (2025-07-01T17:20:59.405Z)

Period.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:20:59.546Z)

everyone will throw up over this, but we may need SOC two compliance

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:00.515Z)

I can go back in and then with then the actual

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:03.856Z)

too. And so starting it around year one, we might need to start to pull in some

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:05.035Z)

technology cost I include that in Bloomberg. All these

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:08.556Z)

cost estimates for SOC two compliance given how

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:08.955Z)

other things. But I'm starting to try on an actual

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:12.816Z)

big this could be. But this essentially sums to I've

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:13.005Z)

budget. And estimate of of what we're gonna need.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:16.946Z)

of put it together like this, and it sums to a total of

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:16.975Z)

And so we don't do this without some sort of like

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:20.416Z)

2,800,000.0 over a twenty four month period.

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:20.695Z)

true pre Right? But but

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:24.036Z)

I can go back in and with Vinod and Howard's actual

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:24.585Z)

through front and family. Right? We could get enough money to get us to the six months mark.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:28.826Z)

technology cost, I can include that and lower all these other things

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:30.545Z)

Yeah. I I think that yeah. Six month mark, I think, is the right

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:33.436Z)

but I'm starting to try to work on an actual budget and an estimate.

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:33.805Z)

way. Look at it. Because you know, once we have a customer who's willing to write a letter or give us

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:37.986Z)

Of of what we're gonna need.

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:39.385Z)

testimonial saying that we changed their life,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:40.866Z)

And and so we don't do this without some sort of, like, true

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:41.545Z)

then that's gonna be a good change. For us in terms of our ability to raise capital.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:45.396Z)

precede investor. Right? But but maybe we

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:45.415Z)

Right. And it's okay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:48.786Z)

through friends and family raise, we could

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:49.555Z)

And the business.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:50.916Z)

get enough money to get us to the six month mark.

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:51.425Z)

Yeah. Simple as. I I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:53.966Z)

Yeah. I mean, I think I think we yeah. The six month mark, I think, is the right way to look at it because

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:54.115Z)

agree. I totally agree with everything. I'm just trying to figure out a way to get from, you know, the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:21:59.106Z)

know, once we have a customer

### You (2025-07-01T17:21:59.895Z)

to that. We might not survive six months because

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:00.786Z)

who's willing to write a letter or give us a testimonial saying that we've changed their life,

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:02.975Z)

don't have any funding. Right? Now. We can't bring

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:05.616Z)

that's gonna be a game changer for us in terms of our ability to raise capital.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:06.155Z)

this idea to the market. Through. This next critical. So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:09.236Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:10.425Z)

let me just leave this

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:10.716Z)

And it's gonna add real value. It's gonna it'll add tangible value to the business.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:11.215Z)

mark. I'll put together a list list of people and we have that. I think our front family

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:15.176Z)

Yes. It will add I I agree.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:15.575Z)

when you put together. Are list. Of people that you think are friends

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:18.196Z)

Totally agree with everything. I'm just trying to figure out a way to get from

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:18.345Z)

and family. And then let's just talk about it and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:21.546Z)

you know, the the the real risk that we might not survive six months because we don't have any funding. Right? And then we can't bring this idea to market.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:22.115Z)

see. You know, what's that it around. And just see. People. First. You know? Stop there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:31.036Z)

To getting through this next critical six months. So

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:31.335Z)

Of funding. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:34.116Z)

let me just leave this market. I'll put together a list of people and you that I think are

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:34.935Z)

stake and it was Yeah. And from my

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:38.456Z)

friends and family, and you put together a list of people that you think are friends and family?

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:41.035Z)

five probably this would be true for Rahul too.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:43.246Z)

And then let's just talk about it and and see

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:44.295Z)

I would rather put my full time on there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:46.696Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:47.245Z)

Complete this.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:47.286Z)

let's bounce it around and

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:47.875Z)

Product. And stay.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:48.976Z)

and

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:49.095Z)

Six months rather than

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:49.546Z)

just see if it's worth going to these people first, you know,

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:50.775Z)

you know. Putting this one hour here and two hours there.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:53.836Z)

some de minimis amount of funding and

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:54.015Z)

And then take twenty four months

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:22:57.436Z)

and and and an early ownership stake in the business.

### You (2025-07-01T17:22:58.715Z)

So I'm in if we can get funding, I would

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:00.856Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:01.585Z)

completely go full time with this.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:02.396Z)

From my perspective and probably this

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:03.415Z)

If possible. If not, then that's a different scenario. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:05.926Z)

would be true for Howard too.

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:06.595Z)

Got it. And

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:08.546Z)

Would rather put my full time on this and complete this product and say,

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:08.635Z)

pages do you have one? I send a ZIP file around. Everyone to this is in zip file from if you

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:13.266Z)

six months rather than, you know, putting just one hour here, two hours there.

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:14.915Z)

you wanted to look through it. Along with a bunch of other research and

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:18.236Z)

And then take twenty four months.

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:18.875Z)

and early camps sizing. That I did. I think is outdated.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:22.786Z)

I mean, if we can get funding, I would

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:23.725Z)

Now. But okay. So I guess it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:25.666Z)

go full time with this.

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:27.275Z)

it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:27.386Z)

If possible. If not, then that's a different scenario. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:27.615Z)

is this a good thing to stop? And then I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:30.586Z)

Got it. And, Mark, if you just you have all

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:30.915Z)

start next week with with two working sessions.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:33.726Z)

I sent a zip file around to everyone. So this is in the

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:34.705Z)

A week? Does that survive? If you notice? Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:36.956Z)

ZIP file from Okay. If you you wanna look through it along with a bunch of other research and

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:39.095Z)

Yeah. Okay. So this is premed here.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:42.416Z)

in the early

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:43.025Z)

One to six? It is per month.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:44.676Z)

TAM sizing that I did, which I think is outdated now. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:45.095Z)

But have to realize that in months. Like, this was a strange

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:49.006Z)

okay. So I guess it's it's

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:49.025Z)

with more of it. AI help me with. So it's like stream average. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:51.696Z)

this a good place to stop? And then

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:53.405Z)

don't really need $40,000 of

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:23:54.336Z)

we will start next week with with two working sessions a week. Does that sound alright to you guys?

### You (2025-07-01T17:23:56.795Z)

founder's comp each month. Right? We could do. A lot less than that. But we do need to get the know being able to work full time I need to be able to work full time. On this. You know, who would need the we need. To be able to travel Like, we can do so much. Of this. We have teams called but Mark, you know, we're

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:01.096Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Let me get a good idea. Okay. So this is per month here in month month to six? It is per month, but you have to realize that in months like, this was a straight It was more of AI helped me with it was, like, a straight average. Right? So we don't really need $40,000 of

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:20.065Z)

business as a personal

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:20.666Z)

founder's comp each month. Right? We could do with a lot less than that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:20.935Z)

business. Right? And so so much better if and I are sitting in the office

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:25.666Z)

We do need to get Vinod being able to work full time. I need to be able to work

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:26.425Z)

with group now. We're sitting here. And after we go through

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:30.006Z)

full time.

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:30.645Z)

maybe a trial

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:31.246Z)

On this.

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:32.525Z)

on what am I saying? Like a proof of concept

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:33.186Z)

You know? And we need the we need to be able to travel

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:35.545Z)

video or something, but for us to physically

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:36.866Z)

because we're gonna like, we can do so much of this via

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:37.375Z)

go have lunch or dinner work because we're just through very personal industry.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:41.516Z)

via Teams calls. But, Mark, you know, we're our business is a personal business.

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:42.505Z)

So I know we need travel. We're gonna need some legal

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:45.856Z)

Right? And so it's so much better if you and I are sitting in

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:46.075Z)

expense. Here to truly get truly get incorporated in an optimized

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:49.986Z)

the office with Greg Friedman. Right? And we're you know, after we go through

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:50.335Z)

running. We're gonna need it. To stir it. I mean, I I think I think

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:54.956Z)

maybe a trial on a or what am I saying? Like, a proof of concept

### You (2025-07-01T17:24:55.265Z)

Do we Or something we can forecast. No. I think we're definitely gonna want Anna a minimum

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:24:59.866Z)

video or something, but for us to physically go have lunch or dinner or because just a very personal industry. So I know we need

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:04.785Z)

you know, coverage

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:25:08.206Z)

travel. We're gonna need some legal expenses here to truly get

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:08.725Z)

errors and omissions. Which is Yeah. Pretty standard for any type of consulting or any type of business like that. And it's

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:25:13.006Z)

truly get incorporated and up and running. Gonna need insurance I mean, I I think I think

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:17.835Z)

not expensive. I'm

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:25:19.926Z)

Howard Wright, do we need insurance, or is that something we can forego?

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:20.305Z)

I don't know what else we would need. I mean, we don't have a physical office. We don't have anything

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:25:23.996Z)

Initially?

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:27.175Z)

So other than that, you'll probably wanna check with an attorney. But, yeah, I can't think of anything else.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:25:34.626Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-01T17:25:44.585Z)

About the tax. The cloud. That maybe that's way too high for the first few months. Wouldn't even tackle self compliance until really the after a year. We can do a lot of that our ourselves. But we will need to find a whole logo so that we

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:01.896Z)

There's not so much here though. I mean, other than the founders compensation. I mean I mean, may and you and Vinod will know about the tech

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:02.525Z)

can go and go with the trademark process and things like that. Will need some legal expense. Yeah. I don't know

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:10.336Z)

the cloud, that maybe that's way too high for the first few months.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:10.785Z)

I I'll look to you guys on that. I don't need an outsource staff.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:14.676Z)

We wouldn't even tackle SOC compliance until really the

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:14.955Z)

But guys might need it on the technology side.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:18.506Z)

after a year. Marketing we can do a lot of that ourselves, but we will need a final

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:23.425Z)

Get up to the speed. But I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:25.756Z)

logo so that we can go get going with the trademark

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:25.945Z)

not think that we need them here in US. I can get them done from India to

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:29.646Z)

and things like that. We will need some legal expenses.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:30.175Z)

good contacts there. I about it for that. Too.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:34.916Z)

I don't know about I I'll look to you guys on the I don't need any outsource staff.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:34.975Z)

So Right. Accounting insurance. And the slip are always really small estimates in the

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:39.316Z)

But you guys might need it on the technology side.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:41.105Z)

So I I think this is probably

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:43.176Z)

I really need some junior guys whom I can train.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:43.875Z)

a pretty good I mean, it's at least a the start.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:47.426Z)

You know, they can get up to their speed. But I

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:47.855Z)

Point. For us for we have something that we can start to work from.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:51.016Z)

not necessarily need them here in US. I can get them done from India to have

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:51.655Z)

And say, too high, too low, Right? And come and come up

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:55.176Z)

good contacts there.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:55.345Z)

with some something. Yeah. And Diane also

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:56.566Z)

I need a lot of budget for that, though.

### You (2025-07-01T17:26:58.675Z)

if you have any idea, like, what how it should be

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:26:59.966Z)

So Right. Accounting, insurance, and miscellaneous, those are all really small estimates.

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:01.615Z)

how you can kind of probably you know, get that done by very low cost.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:04.836Z)

In the grand scheme of things. So I I think this is probably a pretty good

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:08.275Z)

Quote low

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:10.126Z)

I mean, it's at least it's a starting point for us. We're have something that we can start to work from and say,

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:14.635Z)

see if you could give me some idea of how the logo should

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:17.506Z)

too high, too low, right, and and come up with something.

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:18.865Z)

look and what are the strip that they have.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:21.056Z)

Yeah. And then also about logo, if you have any idea, like, what how it's

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:24.705Z)

Created. I think it's great. It probably just needs

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:25.996Z)

be. I can kind of probably

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:27.445Z)

to be finessed a lot. Bit. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:28.916Z)

get that done at very low cost.

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:29.205Z)

For, like, a problem. Product that we

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:32.576Z)

Get a good logo done from, you know, someone at very low cost, some freelancer or someone. But

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:36.095Z)

stuck with the logo on on the We're trademarked.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:38.946Z)

just if you could give me some

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:39.175Z)

It, but I

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:41.436Z)

ideas, like, how the logo should look and what else

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:44.795Z)

done with.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:44.816Z)

should it have, then it'll be Got it. And I'm and, Vinod, I love the logo you created.

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:49.035Z)

A lot of money. But we should have

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:50.356Z)

I think it's great. It probably just needs to be finessed a little bit, right, for, like, a a

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:50.905Z)

some. You know, guideline around how it should look and all that. Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:27:55.146Z)

actual trademark, the lobe the logo

### You (2025-07-01T17:27:55.605Z)

And and then I know, like, you're right. Closest but I'm just gonna end this by saying,

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:00.056Z)

Right? Because we're stuck with the logo once unless we retrade market.

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:00.745Z)

to you guys, I totally believe that

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:04.396Z)

But I don't wanna Yeah. Respend money to retrademark

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:04.615Z)

we could be looking at a business

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:07.476Z)

a logo. Yeah. We can really get it done with some professional designer.

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:07.615Z)

that looks like what I've read is you could convince your investors that you can do

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:12.416Z)

Mhmm. And not lot of money, but we should have

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:14.315Z)

30 k ARR that's a

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:16.026Z)

some, you know, guideline around how it should look and all that.

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:17.505Z)

reasonable estimate. But

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:19.666Z)

Got it. And and then I know we're like,

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:19.765Z)

I swear God, I mean, knowing how interconnected the hotel history is, we could

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:22.686Z)

we're right. We're gonna close this, but I'm just gonna end this by saying, you guys, I

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:25.045Z)

we could really get it to a 100 k in ARR. We start to think

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:27.116Z)

totally believe that

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:28.785Z)

about how to pull Harvey and pro

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:29.876Z)

we could be looking at a business that

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:30.625Z)

war and, like, solve these problems. This is a

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:33.816Z)

like, what I've read is if you could convince your investors that you can do

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:34.495Z)

sizable sizable opportunity. And I think to lose it

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:38.786Z)

30 k in ARR, that's a reasonable

### You (2025-07-01T17:28:39.695Z)

because know, because we we can't keep this really

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:43.456Z)

great for five. People.

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:28:46.226Z)

on this call. I'll give you

### Guest (2025-07-01T17:29:27.876Z)

Right? I mean, this is always the issue. So it's

No. I think it it was yeah. Because that's what we did.

### You (2025-07-01T17:29:54.525Z)

servicers and everybody else, you know, that's not something that I tend to consider. And so you know, I I feel that you know, brokers would be our first target, but, now I'm thinking you know, what I once I've heard what you've got to say about the lenders and everything else, I'm I'm gonna sit back and let you guys fight that one hard.
