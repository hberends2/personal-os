### You (2026-01-16T16:38:34.686Z)

Hey. Good morning. Good. Afternoon. How much stuff? Good. Focusing mostly on consulting. And got a couple startups, actually, that I'm working with right now, and a third. In some very early stage conversations. It's something that I really kind of did a few years ago. And I think at this point in my career, which is a nice way of saying at my age, I think getting a full time job is going to be a little bit of the challenge. Yeah. Just about. Yeah. I left graduates at the end of January, so I think it was probably late February, March. Time frame. But, yeah, I've been doing a lot of work. In app development. In fact, that's one of the startups. Is essentially what we did at rediq with a valuation model. But for the hospitality industry, Yeah, which is interesting. Because I thought every single asset class out there had some type of evaluation model. And it turns out there is nothing like it. For hotels. It's such a very small and very unique. Type of asset, right? There's no rent rolls. They have a totally different KPIs. And the way that they calculate. But it's actually easier. I'm really surprised. It's much simpler, but it's just one of those industries where everybody knows everybody. Everybody's got their own Excel model, but we've been getting some really good traction. And good reception to it. I think it's one of those where everybody realizes how valuable it would be, but nobody saw it. That anybody else was. All of the above. So hotels. Just the actual valuation process. It's very simple, right? Math is math. It doesn't matter if you're looking at a hotel. Multifamily self storage. Anything. Like I said, there's no rent rolls to process. And as an industry, they're the only one that I've come across so far in commercial real estate that they actually do have a standardized financial statement. Whereas in multifamily and everything else, revenue on top, expenses on the bottom. And that's wild. Yeah. This swarm. Yeah, they have a formal organization and they all use the same. So that portion is pretty simple. Where it comes down to is you could have yourself a Motel 6. Or you could have yourself the Wind Resort in Las Vegas. Retail, multiple restaurants and level of detail. And that's where it gets very tricky. It's like having. Individual business units within the hotel. And they're often run that way. Right. So that's where it gets tricky. We haven't gotten to that part yet. We are actually taking baby steps, which is the right way to do it. And focusing more on the lenders, because the lenders don't really get into that level of detail. They just want to know. Will this generate enough cash to pay the mortgage? Right. And so we don't have to get into that level of here's a Starbucks kiosk and here's the breakfast. And, yeah, they've got golf course, all these other things, which is going to get complicated, so we're working our way up to it. But the market would be obviously the brokers, the investors, appraisers, lenders, and eventually the asset managers. Each one, the core is the same. It's just a little bit of a different flavor. As to the model. So that's. That's been keeping me busy. They recently had a blow up between a couple of the founders, so trying to wait for the dust to settle from that. It happens. Yeah, but. Yeah, then there's another startup that's not in the valuation space, but in the fintech space for multifamily cash management. A few other things. That one is also at the very early stages. But the good thing about that one is the founder there and his partners have been doing it for 25 years. They've had many startups under their belts. The other one. The hotel is actually a consultant. She's been in hospitality for 30 years. She's been trying to get something like this up and running for five years. But obviously no experience in software startup. Anything else? So that one's taking longer. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How to pull it off, isn't there? So. So what have you been up to? Yeah. Yeah. O. Kay. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah, yeah. Y. Eah. Right. Yeah. Y. Eah. Not. Familiar. Okay? Y. Eah. Y. Eah. I really. I was impressed by the. The business model. It was very interesting. I'm glad to hear it was getting some traction. Sounds like they're doing fairly well. Yeah. Yeah. That has always been a challenge. The onboarding and the integration. It's been that way for since the first day I started in the industry, and I don't see any particular end in sight. Yeah. A lot of the companies that I have been involved in and a lot of the people I'm talking to, you know, they always talk about API integrations and getting all of this out there. It is one industry that baffles me why they push back so much. Like the yardies and the real pages and everybody else. There are some newer property management organizations in the multifamily space that are embracing it, but they're very small. They've only been around for a couple years. They are hardly even large enough to be on Yardy and real pages, Radar. But they could. They could make some inroads, but, yeah. The lady that I'm working with on the hotel space, you know, she keeps talking about APIs, and I can, like, we don't need an API number one yet, unless we start doing the asset management portion, and we get people who need to go back and forth, but. A lot of people out there just. They don't understand them. They think it's just a quick plug and play. You just get it up and, you know, connect to it. That's all you got to do. Yeah, yeah, just. Yeah. And then. And then, of course, AI. Now everybody's saying, oh, well, AI can do it all. Yeah. Actually, I think that's probably. The. The brightest spot. In making it more easy. Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. I have tried every tool on the market. I just love playing with this stuff, seeing what can do, you know? But I think I pretty much settled on Claude Code. And using that in the terminal. Although there's. There's other ways of doing it, but that one seems to be. Everybody, every. Everybody loves it. I think Claude and Anthropic are really kind of focusing more on that. Business type. ChatGPT kind of has all the individuals, you know, they've got codecs they're trying, but I just think Anthropic is making way more progress, you know, because they've also introduced the Claude code in the desktop, they've got the Claude Chrome plugin. All these different things you can. Now it connects directly to your computer, so you can actually retrieve files. It's like another desktop. So that one makes it very easy. So the proof of concept I built. It's probably gone through three or four different tools, but I now have it all. All within Claude code. At first. There's a lot of hard coded, just sampled data in there. I've been converting and I'm about probably 80% making it a fully live. Proof of concept mvp. And it works. It works great. Everybody says, though, that, you know, it's not really enterprise level code, and I'm not a coder. I can't go in there and read the code, say, that works. But I know, especially with the agents that Clog has introduced, you can really get way closer to production level code. Using that. And so what I. What we did is we also have a Full Stack engineer who came with me from Rediq. So he's been involved and he's done a lot of work. Brilliant. Full Stack. So I'll put together the proof of concept, and then he'll take what I built. And make whatever changes that they feel necessary for. A production level. And so that's. That's helped really well, so I've got my proof of concept, then he's putting together the mvp, and that's what will actually go out. To the clients with for beta testing and everything else. From a time standpoint, I. I mean, you can put out these products. In days or weeks compared to months. The only thing that's holding us back is. The funding. That's where that kind of that partnership blew up is we had one. One. One of the Parkers was a broker investor. In a hotel developer. And Diane, who was the consultant? That this is her brainchild. Wanted him to help out because he's got all the connections. He knows everybody in the industry. And, you know, he was going to help bring in financing, funding and everything else, but he refused to talk to anybody until we had the perfect product. Yeah. Y. Eah. And that's where. That's really where it fell apart. Because, yeah, he. He knows nothing about software development and he. He didn't want to affect his reputation by coming up with something like that. In the meantime, Diane, who has connections, but not at, you know, the C suite level. She went out and raised, I don't know, 35, 000. But it was. It was. It was a little late. So we had this whole period of time between June. When I started working with the engineer with the proof of concept and everything through, I think it was like right before Thanksgiving when when hit the fan and, you know, we could have easily had a very great MVP probably at the September time frame, but it just kept dragging out and dragging out, but they finally resolved everything and then we're about to get back on track. But. But, yeah, from. From a coding standpoint, proof of concept, you know that it works really well. Why I kept switching around is, you know, if you're working with Bolt or Rap Litter, lovable. At some point, it kept getting into the doom loop and it just kept breaking it. And fix one thing Howard, like, whackable. Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Es. That type of work is good, but there's also some really good specialized projects. Or tools out there for creating decks and stuff. But yeah, I've kind of found the same thing. That there are certain third party tools that I would rather use than try to fight it. With having. Having that. Go. Right. Yeah. Yeah y. Eah, yeah. Yeah. That's a big factor. Everybody gets mad at. Mad at the tool that it's like, well. You have to say more than just build me a. Name. More detail than that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, right now it's mostly word of mouth or. Contacts that I've had in the past. I'm kind of in this situation where the projects I'm taking on, the startups that I'm working with, it's like. I don't feel I can take on a whole lot of little projects. I could right now, but I don't want to get myself into a position of, you know, getting. Getting into a position where I can't deliver as much as I want to. Yeah. Yeah. And I would. I would certainly. You know, I'm kind of like you. I mean, I would love to have the stability. You know, paychecks are nice. I like that. But honestly, I've had some absolutely amazing phone interviews. And it's like. They were almost to the point. Like the. I think you know, you're the perfect candidate for this. But don't I get on a video? And the hiring manager is half my age. It's like, then the next thing you know is we've decided to pursue another candidate. Ageism in this industry. Is, you know, I'm double the average age, you know? Y. Eah. Right. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Y. Eah. No, I, I, that's, that's the part I enjoy. And it's because of that that I think I get more traction. And better reception when I come at it from either a fractional or type of consulting framework. Like I said, there's a third one that I'm working on, which is a direct competitor to rediq, that from a technology standpoint. They. Were ahead of Rediq. They. They leapfrogged. From a product offering standpoint, they're behind. So we've had some good conversations so far about, you know, filling in those gaps. And going from there. But. But, yeah, if I were to. I'm not opposed to sending in a resume, but I'm getting to the point where it's like, It's a waste of my time. Yeah, there's many ways to spend my time where I could actually, you know, start bringing some revenue than going through the whole seven stage interview process, etc. So. But what specifically then are you looking for? I know you kind of mentioned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Ahead. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. I've heard similar. Yes. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Okay? All right. Yeah, yeah, that. That helps clarify things. I will certainly. Keep an eye out if I do come across anything. Yeah, because I'm still in contact with a lot of different people, follow a lot of those different organizations in LinkedIn and other, other. Market or other other marketing venues, magazines, trade, trade newsletters, etc. So, yeah, if I do see anything, I'll certainly help. And, yeah, it's like the, you know, the opportunities that I've got certainly don't fall into that series. Run is bootstrapping. The other two are still. Trying to get there first round. Yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. Right. Yeah. Easily. Or more. That's the starting point. Okay? Y. Eah. No. I appreciate you reaching out. That was very kind of you to do that. Okay. No, sounds good. And my mind. Is pretty much unchanged. And my LinkedIn profile I did. Revise that to focus more on fractional and consulting. But in terms of it, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Okay? All right. I did notice, you know, back when. The class action lawsuit. And everything was hot and heavy. For real, Page, you know, they did a lot of downsizing. On top of all the downsizing they did for the Bravo acquisition. But. I have seen their hiring picking up lately, so keep an eye on it. Yeah. He is he? I have a lot of respect for him. So my first time working with them was 2006, and. You know, Steven was the founder. CEO. He been there since day one. I don't dislike him. He's okay. But he had a nickname. People used to call him Steve Blowing in the Wind. Because it's like he'd be off in different directions, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, one day where you're the golden child and you're going to save the company, the next day he's off on some other thing. But his number two man there was was Dean Schmidt. And he and I worked really closely together, but he retired. And then dirk. Came in to replace Deans. So? So Dirk was number two for quite a while. I met him a couple times, didn't work with him. That was kind of that time period after I left and before I came back the second time. But. Yeah, right. You know, when. When will page was bought by tomo bravo, steve retired. And then they brought in another CEO and I forgot her name. She had a really good reputation. I don't know why she left. It could be because of the doj. Never did here. But then, yeah, when I saw Jerk announce that he had taken the position as CEO and was back, I thought, you know, that's a good sign. And that's again, what I saw. A lot of the openings starting to appear. So, yeah, I think they probably had the rebound. I'm thinking, though, that so many people that I worked with are no longer there. But if you see anything. And you want more information, let me know, because there are quite a few people. That were quite junior level that I, that I worked with, but some of them I've seen have. Gone up a little bit, but in terms of the C suite, Nobody. That was there at the time. I was there, no longer there. Likely, at least to. To get your foot in the door. Yet. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that. No, that's true. But really, they are a good organization. They do pretty. Well. But. One of the things that has always troubled me, and I don't think it's gone away, is it is very siloed. Their business model has always been growth through acquisition. They don't originate any of their products. Right. So that's always been a challenge. Even with in the groups. It's like if I need something from another team, from another product, it's like I'm an external client. And I have to wait in line. And I always thought, you know, somebody could get in there. And. Destroy that culture. That would be such a game changer. Because. Yeah. I mean, we were talking at one time about needing an API for the utility management from another team. Internally. We had to pay for it. Just like we recline. It's like, okay, so every department, really, anybody who is PNL responsibility, even if it's somebody else in another part of the organization, it's still a business relationship. You know, we're going to charge you for this. We're going to. Do that. So, yeah, I, I, I can't say with 100% certainty that it's still to that extent. You know, maybe she made. Some progress there and, you know, maybe Dirk will do better, but that was. That was probably my number one complaint of working there is that. It was? Yeah, Just multiple business lines under the same roof in the building. But, yeah, smart people. Definitely. Yeah. So. All right. Yeah, it was good catching up. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah, absolutely. All right. Take care. Yep. You too. We'll see. You. Bye.
