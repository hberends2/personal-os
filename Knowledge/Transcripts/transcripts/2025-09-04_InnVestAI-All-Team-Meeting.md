# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:31:29.589Z)

Thing to say. Okay? Aws cost is going to vary. Month. And I believe it's only going to go up, not come down. But only based on utilization. Which I guess I was originally thinking it would be nice to try to put a cost to each. Feature or phase of the product. But I guess if most of the costs are fixed, then it's really just a matter of how long are we operating, and that is more or less the indicator of cost versus what are we developing or which feature are we working on. Right. So in the cost is going to go up, provided that we're going to use. Some AI model we're going to train that we'll probably have more utilization from the database perspective. And then in future, we'll also have a production environment, and then we'll have to use more monitoring. As well as security in place for the production, right? So it's definitely going to go up.

### You (2025-09-04T21:32:46.872Z)

So. Drew, can you. Can you explain what you mean by tracking it? By feature or.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:32:58.389Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So. Mark, diane. You guys was on, right? I see you both. Are you on mute? Where are you guys? Let me check here.

### You (2025-09-04T21:33:11.672Z)

Yeah, it looks like they're both on mute.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:33:14.229Z)

Okay. Yep. Sorry I'm here on camera today. All right. Let me. Okay, so. Let's see. We'll just go through this in order because, you know, I will get to it. You guys can see my screen, right?

### You (2025-09-04T21:33:33.032Z)

Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:33:35.909Z)

Okay? So on the operating agreement, I reviewed it. I put it. I had some comments. And Diane, we should meet separately to just discuss. And I just wanted to clarify, because you said you used AI to review and do all of that. To, I guess, help with it. And I wanted to clarify, did you, like, take the original agreement and run it through AI and, say, make these changes, or did you, like, kind of go section by section? And I took your agreement and I started to go section by section where there was, like, a choice of what to choose. And that just led me into. It just naturally led me into a territory where I was copying in so much additional language, like, it would say, yes, go with this option. But by the end of it, I had almost created a new agreement. And I kept going back to AI and saying, is this overkill? And I think I've got, like, the way. Can you say this, like, perplexity and I were having a conversation in the. I kept asking, like, is it perhaps lose this overkill? And it would be this is what a modern LLC for tech company, I mean, would look like, so. If you guys want to run it through AI. I think Howard already did. But kind. My thing was more. I don't want to run it through AI. I think it's been done enough. And I reviewed it, you know, like myself, and went through each section and thought through each of them. And it did seem like a lot of it had been from the original template had been rewritten, which. Is not good or bad. I just. If I'm take it to my attorney, I'm guessing that the more it's rewritten, the more he'll have to spend on it. Time wise, and then the more expensive it gets. And so that's kind of. I'm like, well, do I want to ask him? Because he's like, yeah. He's like $600 an hour. Nice. Probably cheaper that $400 an hour. I don't know, but it's expensive. So I'm just like, you know, is it necessary to have him. How much is it worth spending, having him spend on it to review and discuss and go back? It's like. Or is it sufficient? Or do we want to have Mike, your husband, friends? Yeah, my friend can do that for us. Can. Like, we could have a call with him and he could give us his view of each section. If that's. If that would be helpful to the group. Yeah. What's his name again? Mike. What? I'm sorry, what? Drew? What was his name? It was mike or michael. Mike sherbin. S h e r b a n. So then we'll just set up the time to review tomorrow or early next week. And since we are talking about llc, can I add one quick point as well? So I reviewed that as well, and I spoke like email dying about it. I think we'll have to go through an immigration attorney once, considering my visa situation. So I'm trying to find a good attorney, and we'll probably close it. Afterwards. We need to go through an immigration attorney to make sure that everything abides by. Like your having your wife sign. Yeah. And you know, we are in the compliance of the visa rules. Right? Yeah. In. The previous attorney did say that, you know, my wife can sign it and all, but from H1B perspective, we'll have to see how that would work out. Okay. You'll follow up on that? Okay, just let us. Before you do anything, just. If you. If you have somebody, let us know. When you are like, to the point where you think you found somebody and we can discuss. What to ask them. And how to ask it. Sounds fun. Just really quick because you reviewed the LLC agreement as well, Howard, right? I mean, do you Thoughts feedback back. I know we talked a little bit about like how crazy all the spousal stuff was, but. What I just asking you to chime in with your thoughts on it as well.

### You (2025-09-04T21:38:41.992Z)

No. Yeah. The only thing that I saw, that I questioned was the spousal agreements. My assumption was that applied only to the node. But I guess I think my question was, am I correct? Is that what the intent was to. Just because of the nodes situation with his wife that we had to have something special in there. Personally, I really don't believe we need to have spouses saying that.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:39:15.669Z)

I read it as it just was spousal consent for. Unique circumstances. It didn't seem like it applied to everybody. It's not the way that I read.

### You (2025-09-04T21:39:25.912Z)

's. Yeah. Yeah, okay. But other than that, no, I did not see any real issues with it at all. And. The analysis that I got was basically kind of pretty much conferred. It. No real concerns.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:39:54.069Z)

All right, well, hopefully we can get that. Finalized. Or at least very close to finalized, I guess was Thursday. You know, maybe tomorrow. Or early next week, depending on Benod's piece. And then we can do the bank account remotely, et cetera. Not really anything on the rest of these because they're dependent on some of this other stuff. I. Still playing around with the idea of how best we do this agenda and practice, and I'll kind of get to what I mean by that in a minute. On the finance piece. So, Diane got your budget. And did you. Was that put together with Howard? Like, I know you guys have been talking. Were these numbers? No, we need to go. I need to sit with Vinod and Howard and go through their six month roadmap. Right. But this was done. I did carry some of the original estimates that they had. Into this budget, but it doesn't reflect the work they've done over the last two days, with the exception that I added. To AI resources junior product manager. And a software engineer. And I had no idea how to estimate what that was, so I literally just guessed and what an annual amount might be, and I took half of it for each one. So that's something for us to discuss as a team. I mean, practically, we wouldn't be bringing those. So I have it in here for six months. Practically. There's no way we could get someone on that quickly, right? I don't know if that's the direction we want to go from an AI perspective. But that's for us to talk about as a team. It's just a placeholder for now.

### You (2025-09-04T21:41:47.992Z)

Okay. So, yeah, I was. I was a little concerned when I saw the 65 and the 90, because that's probably less than half of what it would be, roughly.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:41:57.509Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T21:41:57.912Z)

But you're saying that that's a six month estimate, not a 12. Correct.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:42:01.749Z)

Yep. Y.

### You (2025-09-04T21:42:02.232Z)

Okay. All right. Yeah, I don't. I mean, you're not far off on the junior product manager. Then the node will have to confirm whether or not we get an engineer. Focus on the AI for 180 annually.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:42:23.589Z)

Eah. And I said 130 for the junior product manager annually. Right. But. But I do think when we start talking to investors, We need to really show the timeline on a monthly basis. Yeah. And we get to. When we, when we talk about, you know, whether or not we want to add an AI engineer. We need to actually show in that chart specifically what the impact to the timeline is with or without that person. I mean, that's the level of specificity. That investors are going to want to see. So we can't just say, you know, an AI engineer would be good. We have to actually show like it's a 12 month process. To do X, Y and Z. But if we get an engineer tomorrow. Then it becomes a three month process. That's, I think that's the kind of. Thing that we need to present. I agree. That's why I started to in the same document that I basically just collapsible rose to your right or columns basically have a month by month. Call it actuals, budget, forecast all rolled into one, but basically just giving us. Our estimate, you know, estimates of what our costs are and therefore what our fundraising needs are, because I think it's going to be very much. At least in the in for the next few months. It'll be kind of a month to month. Right? Like it'll be month to month discussion, right? Or every week we discuss, you know, what's our progress. On the product. What are the expenses associated with that? And then what's the forward look as far as, like, product development and expenses associated with that? Right. So we really should, I think, be discussing all of that. Like, so what I want to do is translate, Dan, what you did into a month by month. Breakdown here. And then we can, you know, like, for these two, you know, AI engineers or product and engineer. Right. We can. We can really speak to. And I would say that they're going to fall into this, you know, technology under one of their Technology one under, you know, Howard. The product that we can, you know, speak to when they would be needed. What does that do to the time? The product timeline. Right, so it's not just. One number put in for an entire, you know, phase of the, of the project. Develop product development. Right. It goes really month by month. Does that make sense? Yes. And Howard. That's why I was asking you guys about your cost s Because a lot of what you guys have been talking about. You know, the staff and costs are fixed. For the engineers, for the most part. The infrastructure cost for AWS and whatnot. I mean, there's variability, but it seems like it's more fixed than variable. And same for again, Howard. Like your stuff like this Jira or you know, and. Lovable, et cetera. Those are monthly subscriptions, so they're pretty fixed, right?

### You (2025-09-04T21:45:19.832Z)

They are. They are. And I have never seen a product budget broken down. The weight that you've got it down simply because.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:45:30.949Z)

Well, we can. We can totally do it differently.

### You (2025-09-04T21:45:32.952Z)

Okay. All right. I was gonna say that is. I don't see how that's sustainable, because.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:45:33.029Z)

This is just me. Like.

### You (2025-09-04T21:45:39.752Z)

I. I'm gonna be working out forward. I could be working on version one, right. The engineers could be working still in the poc, and then we're gonna be moving on to the mvp. But we would have to go back and fix something that was done before. There isn't a. There isn't a cut off. Right between the time. Okay, from now on, all we're doing is mvp. There's no more poc, right?

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:46:05.589Z)

Oh, yeah. No, no, no. It's all simultaneous. Well, yeah. I mean, it's. It's. It's meant to be an approximate roadmap. Right? I. I don't think it's right. Well, and I really just want this.

### You (2025-09-04T21:46:13.112Z)

No, but our expenses are related. I mean, basically, for the product, it's my salary and the subscriptions. And then the engineering is what's going to be worked on. I mean, all of those different phases for the PoC, MVP, et cetera, those are all going to be engineering labor. Not product.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:46:35.349Z)

Yeah, that's what I figured. That's why yours is really just, you know, a fixed cost for the most part.

### You (2025-09-04T21:46:41.272Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:46:45.269Z)

Then can I ask a question? Can I jump in here and ask a question? Because. So Howard product. Right? And Howard, you've made a good point about, like, these continuous loops, right? Like, kind of like it's, you're. You're going to work on something, but then it's not like you're not going to work anything after that, right? So as we think about the avm. Once we turn over the POC that you've done to the engineers, then the next thing we might want to do is start to go back through the AVM and start to create these modules, right? Like a really good revenue module. What does that actually look like? It's, you know, how do we do do that better than we've done it before? Or are you thinking something different on that?

### You (2025-09-04T21:47:31.512Z)

No. As far as the revenue. There's just one Revenue. It's AV on revenue, right? As we add more features beyond version 1, where we start to have add ons and optional items that are going to be primarily AI related, then we can start forecasting increases in revenue based on those add ons.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:47:58.869Z)

Oh, no. Maybe. Hold on. I kind of mean like in the avm. If I'm an underwriter. We have set it up almost like that is perfect for select service, right? Sex services is really easy. But full service is very, very hard. And this is where some owners, they'll be, they'll say, like, oh, no, our Excel model is the best Excel model ever. We could never give our Excel model up because we analyze the hotel revenue in such a granular way, right? So at some point we're going to need to create module for the to be able to capture that complex full service hotel, that business that generates so much fee, we're going to need to create like a deeper revenue module in the avm. Does that make sense? Where we start to pull in travel, click data and we start to pull in like, you know, like other. So it will be work on the avm. It'll just be kind of moving the AVM more. Go ahead. That's more of a. That could. It doesn't matter if it's in the ABM or if it's a report or a dashboard or whatever it is. That. Like, that could be. That 's separate from saying something is part of the, you know, MVP or V1 or V2 or V3. And that could be like a V8 feature in the ABM. It's just has to do, I think.

### You (2025-09-04T21:49:26.392Z)

Yeah, and that really falls more in the sales and marketing bucket. Our labor, our expenses, our revenue. It's like putting a drop of water in a bucket. How do you know where that water drop came from? When you're looking in the bucket, right? And we're going to have to talk about what you just said, Diane, because we've been looking at and up to this point. Breaking it up by Persona. So we're looking at lenders and appraisers first, because they don't need to get down into that level of detail, right?

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:50:02.629Z)

High level. Right.

### You (2025-09-04T21:50:04.632Z)

So we're going to have a debt model and then we can go for the equity model for the investors, the brokers, consultants, etc. And then the last would be an asset management. Module, because that one needs to break down monthly, probably get into the weeds. But the equity model is where we're going to get into, like, okay, do you need. What level of detail do you need for that other income? For the food and beverage. We haven't discussed about property type. That's introducing.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:50:32.789Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T21:50:37.992Z)

An incredibly complex level of detail. So.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:50:43.509Z)

Why wouldn't lenders need more detail? No, I don't. Lenders don't need that detail. That's going to become when the owners, when the investors that won't want like that won't want to give up their proprietary Excel models because they feel like they're so good. That part of this eventually will be that hopefully we make the industry better underwriter s right, Especially on complex deals. So, like, right now. I don't. I don't. I don't understand what that means. You know, the lenders are lending. On complex assets. So they're getting information. High level. They look at, they look at the high level, but it's coming from, it's coming from. The Borrower has the complex asset. No lender time with different things. Yeah, this is just about. These are just different product features. I understand, but I'm not sure that's right. I mean, I think Diane is 100% right. Like, we are going to need different modules for different types of hotels. Yeah. I think, is that Howard, also what you would or components to add on that might be of interest to different Persona types. But we can table this. We're kind of far away from this, right?

### You (2025-09-04T21:52:04.472Z)

Yeah, yeah, let's. Let's table this because we are getting into an incredible level of complexity. When we look at it that way. That's, that's why I was looking at lenders who only budget food and beverage at the top line. They don't need to get down into whether it's a kiosk or whether it's fine dining, everything like that. Right? Food and beverage that's. Where I'm talking about the level of detail. I'm not talking about whether or not there's other things. So that's. That's why. That's where I'm separating the debt model from the equity model. But what I'm hearing now is on the equity model, You're gonna want. One for limited service, one for resort, one for all these different things. That.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:52:54.629Z)

Well, what we have kind of is select service already. Everything we've done is how you would model select service. So by nature, it does resemble like how a lender would look at it. It's simple when it's all said and done, it just needs to be fast and accurate. Right later, though. Like, let's call it six months, eight months. When we're doing this Persona work and we're talking to that person, a. Then we'll be sitting down with. And I like the way, Howard, that you're doing it. You're breaking it between kind of like debt and equity. The only thing I would say different is that the debt model for select service. Is is so simple. It kind of is. The equity model, too. There's not much to it. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-09-04T21:53:36.872Z)

Right. Right. Yeah. No, I realize some of them are gonna be basically the same.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:53:42.069Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T21:53:43.352Z)

And I didn't really anticipate charging a different rate for debt versus equity if they are basically the same model.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:53:53.109Z)

I agree with that. Right. For the simple model, yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T21:53:53.112Z)

But we. Let's. Yeah, let's. Let's talk about this, because I don't know what would differentiate a select service or limited service from a resort other than the financial. The line items on the finances. Isn't that just it? You're just gonna be adding more rows. For them to fill in under in the financial area.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:54:15.269Z)

Yeah. You'll be adding more rows. Yep. You will be adding more rows. But the best thing I think we could do is if we table this for today because I can show you, like, if this makes sense. Right. We can go through this with.

### You (2025-09-04T21:54:24.312Z)

Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. I'm visual, so that'll be way better anyway, so, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:54:32.069Z)

Yes. Yeah, I agree.

### You (2025-09-04T21:54:32.472Z)

Yeah. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:54:36.229Z)

Okay. But for so going back to this a budget and product perspective. What I was kind of what I was getting at, essentially, is that we. I want to be able to. Have our budget. You know, again, we can start with what Diane had here, which we need to break down monthly. And the node. And, Howard, you guys should obviously weigh in on. The numbers here. So, Diane, to confirm, like the. Product tools, cloud hosting. This. This was. Yeah, I added the GoDaddy thing because Benod and I had a discussion and he very wisely reminded us that we should extend our GoDaddy domain. Whatever you call it, registration. Because I only set it up for a year. So I. I just literally put a placeholder in it. But the other two Vinod and Howard had given us. I put money in here for a pulse pilot. We can take that out if we don't like it, but I'm incredibly impressed with their product, and I almost think we could just. That's the interactive PowerPoint thing you sent us. Yeah. It looks. It looks so modern and clean and fresh. So they charge 5, 000 per hotel, right? So I kind of thought, well, maybe if we just do one, like one demo version of just one hotel so a customer could see what it looks like.

### You (2025-09-04T21:56:01.512Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:56:14.709Z)

And then I kind of thought maybe we should consider doing our own deck in it. But we don't. I mean, we don't have to have this 10K. I just put it in there in case we decide we like the product and want to try to use it somehow.

### You (2025-09-04T21:56:28.152Z)

Do we have a marketing section in here? Because to me, that's a. That would be a marketing expense.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:56:34.869Z)

Yeah, I can add that. Can change it easily to a marketing expense.

### You (2025-09-04T21:56:38.712Z)

Yeah, either one. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:56:39.429Z)

Yes. Okay? So Drew, if I understand you correctly, you basically want the costing based on each feature. Like if we are developing mvp, how much they are gonna cost? Well, I don't know everything. I mean, originally that was what I wanted, but I don't know that that makes. I don't know how practical that is because, again, like, the costs are largely fixed. For the most part. And so, like, I mean, there's obviously a cost based on the number of hours or the time it takes to develop each feature. But it's. So we could obviously, you know, you could say this feature is gonna take 10 hours. It's gonna cost this much. This feature is gonna take 50 hours, gonna cost this much. But the cost itself. Is not going to change. It's more just what we're gonna get done in a certain amount of time.

### You (2025-09-04T21:57:39.032Z)

So if we are tracking in JIRA and being diligent, diligent about putting in the time and everything that's in there, that is where you can track the hours. And because of the ticket would be assigned to a particular feature, like I'm, you know, working on the AI summary. So we could map fairly accurately. There's always going to be things in Jira. There's always going to be tasks that a developer is going to be working on that don't fit into a bucket. I think we can probably accomplish a lot of what you're looking to do there.

### Guest (2025-09-04T21:58:29.029Z)

Okay, let me just put this here. That. Budget to be. Howard Vidot. Can you take what Diane put together? Just. What are the like monthly? Are these the right things? You know, specific to you, like trademark Pulse Pilot. I think these things would go in a different section, but specific to the, you know, product management and the engineering technology component. You know, are these the right things? How to remove as necessary and then put them, put a monthly cost. Or, you know, verify what, you know, what the monthly cost is. And then we can probably monthly would be simplified rather than in a feature basis. But if you want feature bases, then we'll have to figure that out. Yeah, I think that would come. That could be secondary. Right. Just give the monthly costs based on. The items that are incurring the cost AWS. You know, the engineers. The what? You know, whatever it is, right? To the extent possible. Doesn't need. We don't. I think once it's confirmed, it doesn't need to be that granular. But that way we can track with the cost, because you guys are. Those are, I guess, just the technology, specifically because it could be where most of the costs are. So I just want to track what our rep, kind of what our run rate would be, so to speak. And then we can, I think, layer that onto the product piece that Howard. This piece here, Howard, that you've been together, and we can start to talk about what this is really where we'll talk about, I think, features. You know what? What features are being worked on right now. What's the progress? You know, is it? Is it the timeline that we expected, et cetera? Could you please share the link or that files? File that Ian has created for expenses. Yeah, yeah. Alternative. All right. As far as. So, any questions or anything? Finance right now. So as far as customers, investors. And I think you were working on the pitch deck piece. And, Drew, what I sent you, also, I had. I know you've been keeping a list of people. I have kind of been keeping a list of people that we could go to as well. I think I have, like, 50 or 60 people that may be, you know. Affluent enough to write a check for 2550 K. So you might want to just add those people to your your list of people. Yeah, I did. I did see that. And yeah, we can maybe. Mark, Diane, on our next call, we can talk about. That piece of it. And again, going back to what we talked about earlier, we really want to make sure we know exactly how much we need. For, you know, on a month by month basis so we can take and to hit each milestone and then we can say, okay, we, we know we're going to need. 200 or 300 or whatever thousand it is. For the next three or six months. And that way we know exactly, you know, we can literally just prioritize the people we're going to and. Just only go to as many as we need to to get the money that we need. That would be the. The goal. So I think we're making progress on this piece. And so we hopefully buy, like, hopefully next week we can, we can review and discuss and come close to a, like, a plan of action. For the next couple, for the next few weeks or months to continue that. But. But again, very intentionally. That makes sense. I put Alice in here as a potential mark. Dan will continue to talk about that. We'll talk about that next week. Product technology. So how. Maybe, Howard, you would. You're willing to show us just like. I just want to see if that's a good way that we can talk about products.

### You (2025-09-04T22:03:10.632Z)

Yeah. I can do that real quick.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:03:13.829Z)

And keep us on track as far as what you and Minot are doing.

### You (2025-09-04T22:03:21.352Z)

Let me get that pulled up. Okay, so hopefully you should be seeing it right now. This is what I showed before. Here, let me see.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:04:15.509Z)

Our mind. Let's see our screen.

### You (2025-09-04T22:04:18.392Z)

Yeah, I'm trying to close a couple windows here to get this thing working better.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:04:30.869Z)

Yep, I can see. Now.

### You (2025-09-04T22:04:31.992Z)

All right, well, hold on a second here. Let me try a couple more. Okay? So hopefully this will help out a little bit. So there's a couple of tabs here that always help speed it up. All right. So this is what I've shown before. These are all of the ideas that we've been putting into Trello, etc. Right, now, sorted alphabetically. But this is what we need to be, like, maybe once a week, every other week, to review these. This is where we score the items based on the impact that they'll have, both internally and externally. How confident are we? And then the node comes in here and estimates the effort that it'll take to build it. When you do that, you'll start getting scores here. I also added a column that'll designate which ones are for AI. AI use case. And then here you can see we've got stage roadmap, the target date. So what that allows us to do is we can go then to a product roadmap. Which is essentially a kanban. So any of those items that are labeled as added to Roadmap, they're visible here. Right now we are just using the now, next and later. Roadmap. We're not getting down into weeks, months, etc, on this page. But I'll explain to that later. So let's just say we're working on these now, and let's just say that the financial document processing is done. Then we can just drag it over to the done section and that'll transfer over here. So if I go to the all ideas, look that up, it'll be on the one done. But we can also look at it on timeline. So anytime that we've gone through these all ideas, added them to the product roadmap, there's also a field in there for start date and end date. And so that will put this information here. So we are currently working on the MVP. Expecting it to be done mid late September. Version control is an option. Now some of these are just things that I added in here. And just made up dates just to test this out. But, Drew, this is kind of what you were looking at here. So you can change the views on the roadmap, you can filter by the start and end date, you can filter, sort. You got all different fields. We can change this right now. It's quarterly. You can take a look at it in different processes, but in terms of printing, that's not something that I've tested so far. So we would have to take a look at that. But, you know, we can. We can collapse these. I know. To make it look or easier to view into a now next Slater. And we can filter some of these and perhaps maybe tighten up the timeline here so that we can maybe see a little farther out. Now, this is obviously going for five quarters, so we started getting in April and June and then going through April, June next year. So, you know, we're looking at 15 months here, so it's not too bad. But.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:08:09.029Z)

Yeah, I think if we could, for our week to week call, it'd be good. To, I think, go like a, you know, six months at most. You know, what we're. What we're trying to accomplish.

### You (2025-09-04T22:08:23.432Z)

Yeah. We can't speak with any confidence. What's going to happen next January? So, yeah, that's what we would do. So the idea then is, yes, we would go and take a look at what are we working on now, then what are we going to do next, and then later, and then perhaps some of these also maybe need to be moved up. We might want to move the automated onboarding. To the new or the next group. So going back to the product roadmap, automated onboarding is now in the next column. So whatever way you like to work on it, if you want to look at the list view and to just take a look at everything. These are sortable and filterable, so you can see all this information in the whole lot of different ways. But this is part of jira. So if we did have it set up where the engineers are adding their hours and everything's coming up here, we'll know exactly what tickets they're working on and then what tickets or what projects those are related to. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:09:30.629Z)

Okay? He's back to the product roadmap. Is it possible to go? I'm guessing it's maybe the all ideas list, but, you know, like, where's not on the left side now is valuation model mvp? There are a series of tasks associated with that. Okay? And then.

### You (2025-09-04T22:09:55.752Z)

But they're not. They're not made here. All the tasks would be created in the development portion of jira. So that's actually a totally different tool. But it's part of this group, right? So that's where Vinode and the team, they would create the tickets, and the node would say, okay, Raj, I want you to work on this ticket.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:10:08.469Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:10:19.592Z)

Raj would open up the ticket. He would see all of the information necessary. And as long as he is diligent in including, you know, how many hours need to work on it, you know, keeping track of everything, you know, clicking the boxes when he's done to make sure, because then that flows through from that section of jira. Back into here so it can be used for that.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:10:43.029Z)

Yeah. That's great. We probably shouldn't, on these calls go into that much detail anyway, so that makes sense.

### You (2025-09-04T22:10:49.832Z)

Right? Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:10:53.749Z)

All right, well, I think this. Yeah. This. We can try doing it this way. Using this as part of the product discussion. Which we don't have to spend a ton of time on each week because obviously, you know, we won't finish complete sections of things. I the other part of it, yeah. And this align with how you've done things in the past?

### You (2025-09-04T22:11:22.392Z)

Yeah, yeah, we were using Azure DevOps being a Microsoft shop. But Jira is right now, far and away the. The most popular tool out there. Almost everybody knows how to use it. There are. There are others out there. But this one probably makes the most sense. Now reviewing this all ideas list. This is not something we would do on our Tuesday or Thursday calls. This is something we would need separate call for. Right? Yeah. Cause this could take up an hour and a half.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:11:54.229Z)

No. Yeah. Yeah. Y.

### You (2025-09-04T22:11:57.992Z)

So just by itself. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:11:59.189Z)

Eah. Okay? Just. I'm going to take the sharing back here.

### You (2025-09-04T22:12:06.632Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:12:08.149Z)

So just from this, what you put together here. This product, the product roadmap piece. So the poc. All these components are. For the most part. Defined and like from a product perspective in the poc, they're. They're complete. Right? Let it largely complete.

### You (2025-09-04T22:12:30.552Z)

Yeah, that's. That's the reason for the green check mark.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:12:34.629Z)

Okay. The only thing I was going back to something I put together previously. The only thing I didn't. Or one of the. I guess one thing I didn't see in here was that there should be. We talked about larc, right? That LARC data, which is the market data. And it fits into a specific section of the. Pro forma, right? Like penetration analysis. So I think. That's in the poc. It's in the pro forma piece, but I didn't see, like, LARC on here. I see market data. I see it says, you know, str.

### You (2025-09-04T22:13:14.392Z)

Yeah, I didn't. I didn't do anything in the POC for larc. That would have to be something that we. If you want it mentioned specifically, we would want to add that to version one.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:13:16.629Z)

Ip. Well, I just want to make sure it's not. Yes, I think we we do need to add that that does need to be included in.

### You (2025-09-04T22:13:29.592Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:13:33.269Z)

Sooner rather than later. Do you? I mean. Isn't there one line in the POC rule we have? Like, macroeconomic forecast data entry, or am I crazy? I don't. I'm not remembering that correctly.

### You (2025-09-04T22:13:49.512Z)

There are, there are the two worksheets that you asked for for occupancy and transaction history, and those are the ones that he mentioned that they typically get on the phone. Call people and then they can record the information there.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:14:04.949Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:14:05.932Z)

We didn't do anything specifically for larc. I know. We've talked about it. But we can add it in. It's not a problem. But doing anything in the POC right now is just a waste of time. That was just a tool built in, lovable.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:14:20.789Z)

Then next.

### You (2025-09-04T22:14:22.892Z)

For our own use. So anything we do now we would want to add to the MVP or version one. And remember, if we say we wanted in the mvp, then we're going to have to add more time. To the release because that's not in the requirements today. I would say let's stick to what we have in the requirements. Let's start with our beta testers, but at the same time they can start working. Remember, we're using CI CD, so if we don't get it in, let's just say September 30th, the MVP is ready. To go. And beta test. That doesn't mean we have to wait 60 days. To add it in. We could add it in by October 10th. Right. So 10 days later, the LARC is there.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:15:11.669Z)

Yeah. Okay? Well, then. Let's shift over to Vinod. Like talking about what? Working on. And I guess I don't know how. I don't want to get overly granular here. We could. I know, knowing myself, I could get super granular asking questions and having these conversations. But from, you know, so I want to keep trying to keep it like balanced of not too high level, not too granular. But can you like, where are you guys on things? What are the, you know, what are you making progress on? What are you having obstacle, you know, what are the offset we'll go on can I ask a quick question before I'm sorry to jump in, but yes. Like, so what features do we have today that are kind of different than what already exists? Like, because I think I'm just. Again, I'm wearing. Separating marketing from. I'm separating technology from marketing. Like, what do we have? If we're doing a demo with someone. What do we have in the version that's available now that that's different than what people have? Today.

### You (2025-09-04T22:16:29.452Z)

Primarily the data extraction. Where they can just upload the document, have it automatically extract the data, map it to the correct place in the model, no copy, no paste. Just quickly inputting the assumptions. The way it's laid out is more natural workflow. You're not jumping from sheet to sheet and doing everything. So we've got the tremendous time savings on the data extraction. We've got time savings. On the model itself. And then when we are ready to go with the mvp, Mvp version one will have the AI generated deal summaries. So that's primarily what we're going out with, with the avn.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:17:20.149Z)

So when will we have the AI Generated deal summaries? Like, when will that be functioning, do we think?

### You (2025-09-04T22:17:26.172Z)

That's targeted for version one.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:17:26.709Z)

Yes. Part of the mvp. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-09-04T22:17:29.452Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:17:31.269Z)

I didn't hear. I mean, yeah, somebody's a part of the mvp. Once the mvb feature is completed,

### You (2025-09-04T22:17:36.012Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:17:36.949Z)

So do we have a rough date for that? I mean, just approximate. Y towards the end of September. Okay? All right. I'm sorry. Yeah. And then in terms of integrating the larc piece, How soon after that?

### You (2025-09-04T22:17:57.132Z)

We're gonna have to. I'm gonna have to set up a meeting. And discuss it in detail. I don't know how we connect to larc. I've heard LARC mentioned in discussions. I don't know if we're just gonna be getting a spreadsheet if we have to have a connection via an API. I don't have any requirements yet for LARC integration.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:18:19.989Z)

Then. Let's. Let's then. Yes, let's set a time on Monday.

### You (2025-09-04T22:18:23.692Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:18:23.909Z)

Or. I mean, it could be tomorrow. But, you know, early next week to do that.

### You (2025-09-04T22:18:27.932Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:18:28.309Z)

Because I think that should be. So I'm sharing my screen again, and I'm just looking at the PDRs and documentation. I'm sorry, Drew. Can you add that to your agenda for next week? Because these are the things that I think are going to be, you know, in speaking with, you know, the analysts, you know, I just think that when we start rolling this out and we ask them to test our technology, You know, I think we need to have a couple of things that clearly are going to get them excited. And I think those are the kinds of things that I think will really generate enthusiasm. You know, because, you know, every time I talk to a analyst and I tell them that we're going to ask them to demo our product, and we're basically asking them to remove themselves from their current model. And move over to something. You know, I kind of just see their concern. Right. So I think we need to sort of wow them with a couple of things. That are going to clearly make their life. A lot easier. And I think those are the kinds of things that I think will attract a lot of attention. Yeah, I agree. I agree. So, Howard, we should do that. Sooner rather than later. I.

### You (2025-09-04T22:19:35.052Z)

I'll let you schedule a time that works for you, because my afternoons after 11 o'clock are wide open. So just pick a day and time and shoot the invite over.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:19:47.189Z)

Please include me in that, guys, okay? In this one. Larc again, it's just an Excel file that we're going to get.

### You (2025-09-04T22:19:54.172Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:19:54.709Z)

Every quarter.

### You (2025-09-04T22:19:55.132Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:19:55.749Z)

Structured data. There's no API. It's just structured data that comes once a quarter. It's very consistent. It's very minimal. It only has, like, you know, eight fields, eight columns. So it should be not difficult.

### You (2025-09-04T22:20:11.212Z)

So again, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:20:11.909Z)

And but it but high impact.

### You (2025-09-04T22:20:13.292Z)

So okay. So the data ingestion seems pretty straightforward. So all I need to do is work with you. And decide, you know, where in the AVM model do we want it to reside? And then I can go into the whichever PRD relates to where we put it. Make an amendment to it. So shouldn't be. It's. You know this isn't going to set us back two weeks, right? So not a big deal. Not that it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:20:40.549Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T22:20:43.452Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:20:45.669Z)

Otherwise. Looking at? The documentation. The node. I mean, these are the components in the MVP that you're working on. When you say you. You know, mvp, End of September. It's these. These components, right? This prdi summary. Is that the one you shared, Howard? In the email. The 11th one.

### You (2025-09-04T22:21:10.252Z)

For the AI summary. Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:21:12.629Z)

This number 11. This is the same one.

### You (2025-09-04T22:21:14.732Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:21:19.269Z)

Yeah, yeah. We are using these documents. Draw. Okay? So. I will go over this. I think I can just. Be from the names and how I know what they correspond to that the features that we have included in the what's going to be included in the mvp. So I'll just go over and we'll add plan to add LARC to this. That should probably be the next thing here. And I'll see if. Make sure there's nothing else missing here.

### You (2025-09-04T22:21:51.372Z)

The only one that's not numbered down there is at the bottom the prd InnVestAI avm formulas. That's. Also part of it. So technically, there'd be 1213 documents related to the actual development.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:22:12.869Z)

If we think of these as the features. Is that? In a very technical, not customer facing, but in a very technical sense. Are these the features we're developing?

### You (2025-09-04T22:22:21.692Z)

Yeah. Essentially what I did is go from 1 through 11 in the order that the POC was. So number one is adding a deal into the deal pipeline. Number two is then putting in the property details. In that modal number three, then. Is that the valuation page? In fact, evaluation page has a few different things going in there. So, yeah, that. That's basically. That's not necessarily set up in the way that the node may want to develop it, but it's set up in the way that the user would go through it.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:22:57.509Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And I think that how I'm a feature would be one. One bigger thing, like performer is a feature, and then other things are part of the feature. So yeah. I know we can. We can be as Grant we could use the term in many ways and be as granular or high level as we want, but. Let me think about that. I do. I do want us to. Be consistent and clear about what we, you know, refer to things obviously, so that we're, you know, not miscommunicating. So maybe we can power Vinod. You and I can discuss that when we talk about the LARC data. We can say if we want to call these features and the next level up, maybe we'll call it a module. Or we should, you know, something like that, so we can be consistent on what we're. Talking about? So quick update from my side. So me personally, I had a lot of pending items which I kind of wanted to clear up, which I did. So I went through the llc document. I went through the AI document that Howard. I put together. And there's one more item. Data database diagrams, which I kind of put together. Drew, I shared with you and everyone. Yeah, I saw that. I will review. Yeah. We were having some issues. In stage environment, so I kind of spend some time day before on that. And I hand it over to the Offshore team. I think it is still not fixed. But apart from that. Team is still working on the extraction insertion and the mapping the data in performer page. We perform is quite basic, definitely challenging. To my app. All the values, put the formulas correctly and then, you know, self test and verify whether everything is as per the formulas. Okay? I mean, I know you're going off the documentation and the poc. Okay, so just put together one formula document as well. Right, so we have that as well. The formula document. Yeah, yeah. No, I went through that last week, I think. So that should. Should be. Should be a part of. Assuming you added to it, clearly clean it up and have all that included. Now you're on mute. Howard.

### You (2025-09-04T22:25:55.772Z)

No, I was gonna say that's. That's a good reminder. I need to go and finish the cleanup on that. I did start on that, so right now it still shows comments and markups, so I'll get that. Finished tomorrow morning. Vinod.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:26:14.709Z)

All right. Anything else, I think. There are some follow ups here as far as the budget goes. Mark, Diane and I are meeting on Monday. To talk more about the customer. Investor pitch deck. Piece of it. And Howard node. I'll reach out to you guys to schedule sponshop about larc. And I think next week we could have a. Very, very. Comprehensive month by month budget for the next six to 12 months. At least as far as run rate goes, you know, our run rate cost. And we can then talk about. To talk about the features and. Well, I mean, I guess we're already talking about that MVP being kind of end of the month. But we can start to talk about the features and timelines. To go along with that. And maybe. Maybe next week or the week after, we should probably talk about those. The ideas list. How are they? You showed us.

### You (2025-09-04T22:27:19.612Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:27:21.989Z)

That was good. And I believe, Diane, you also wanted to do a meeting between Yomi and Howard to go through the budget. Yes, please. Just so I can make sure that I didn't miss anything. Possible to do that tomorrow. Tomorrow. I can't do it. After two. Do it before two. So I know you're working from home tomorrow. So before two works, just not at 11, I think. 11 to 11:30. Apart from 11 to 11:30, I'm available. Okay? So do we just want to decide on a time now?

### You (2025-09-04T22:28:01.452Z)

I'm. I'm wide open. Yeah, I'm. I'm wide open, so just pick whatever works for you.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:28:03.989Z)

You're wide open. Okay? Let's say noon, okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:28:10.012Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:28:11.349Z)

Okay? Cool. Howard and I had a great call with Carrie. How do you want to maybe to tell everyone about Carrie and, like, her marketing, how, you know, how strong she is in marketing and how she might be able to help us? Or okay.

### You (2025-09-04T22:28:33.372Z)

Yeah, no, I can. I can just give a real quick rundown. So, Carrie, I think I may have mentioned this in a previous call, but if not, she was an intern that worked for me at redIQ. She was getting her master's degree at Boston University and marketing. She is brilliant. I mean, she's very good at what she does. And unfortunately, when she wrapped up her internship, Officially. We had a hiring freeze. Not with both Berkadia and Redi. Q. We were fighting like crazy to find a spot for her, and we just couldn't do it. But despite that, she kept working for us for free for about five months because she just loved the experience and really worked very well with our team. So when we brought up the go to market in a couple weeks ago, and what we're gonna have to do in preparation for that, I reached out to Carrie to see if she would be interested in doing some consulting work. Obviously, we're not in a position to hire, but she is more than happy to help us on a project base or, you know, some type of a consulting arrangement. So she is based in the Bay Area. And she has go to market experience in a startup. And she's actually working with the startup right now, so she's. She she wouldn't be coming in blind. She understands that. And the fact that she worked with us at redIQ she would know this product right away. Wouldn't there be very little learning curve for her to just come in and start picking up and running with it? So we did have a good conversation. I'M gonna be with Carrie to see if she can crunch some numbers and figure out, you know, what she would be willing to charge. And we'll get that figured out, and we'll get going. So she can work on the spiff.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:30:42.149Z)

So what roles do you think specifically she could help us with?

### You (2025-09-04T22:30:45.852Z)

More or less the marketing materials. Right? So, you know, we talked about our logo, we talked about, you know, what would we want to start with online, our initial website landing page, and basically anything. Anything having to do with marketing campaigns, marketing materials, things like that.

Even infographics, which is. That's. I mean, that's a lot of work to put an infographic together.

### You (2025-09-04T22:31:09.772Z)

Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:31:14.149Z)

So. Howard. Is she good with ux as well?

### You (2025-09-04T22:31:19.772Z)

I'm sorry. What?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:31:21.749Z)

This should go to the UX as well. Because you said logo. I was wondering if she would be able to create UX designs as well.

### You (2025-09-04T22:31:24.572Z)

Yeah. Let me bring it up. I. I never had her do any type of UX work because we already had our design group. I don't know. I think she would be a very good person to bow's ideas off of, but I don't. In fact, I'm confident she's never worked in Figma or anything like that, so, you know, she could. She could probably do wireframes, mockups, something like that, but.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:31:43.109Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:31:58.732Z)

Probably really more focused on your marketing. Marketing materials, marketing campaigns.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:32:06.709Z)

The mark, she would pretty much be your resource for the most part, outside of us all collectively agreeing on. I mean, well, Vinod has done such wonderful work on our logo, but just like getting, you know, really finalizing what the logo and our colors are going to be, but outside of that, she would be your resource.

### You (2025-09-04T22:32:09.452Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:32:25.749Z)

Great. Okay, that's great. And you said how you said she is working for a startup right now, but would do some, potentially do some, could do some work for us that would be on an hourly or project basis.

### You (2025-09-04T22:32:38.012Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:32:40.229Z)

And cost based on, you know, hourly or project based.

### You (2025-09-04T22:32:43.292Z)

Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:32:48.549Z)

All right. Maybe we can put this in our. We just talk about what, you know, if anything right now would be good. I mean, obviously spending money being not something we want to do much of, but to the extent that there's a, you know, marketing, content, collateral need, we can talk about that. I do think we do need to get our logo and our trademark done. And I. And again, I can't say enough about what Vinod has done, but we're going to need someone with a true professional background here because we want to get that trademark as soon as possible. So on that part, there is some urgency. Sherbin brought that up to me. He's like, you guys got to get that. Trademark. You know your logo trademarked sooner than later. So I just wanted to mention like that. Piece of it is really important because when we go out to market and really start to show people we don't want to be then midway changing the look and feel of what our colors are, what our logo is and all of that, So then there are two things, right? One is the logo creation, another one is trademark. Right. Right. So do we need an auto trademark? How does that work? The logo. Isn't it awesome that Sherbin is a patent attorney? So he'll walk me through the process. I don't think we'll need to incur legal costs for that. Okay, so we want a professional logo to be created that we can get done. Like, I can give you. We don't need to. Hire a dedicated person with just low creation. That we can outsource and get done. Just the logo piece, then, Vinod, I'll send you what I sent to Howard. And what do you mean about marketing? And he may have forwarded it to Carry, but just on some ideas like you know what I mean, that are out there floating around in the industry that we might take inspiration from if that makes sense. Right? And we might, you know, we might wait for K to join in and we're, you know, take inputs from her and then design the logo. Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:35:21.132Z)

And the node. Take this in the spirit that it's meant. But you've got so much on your plate right now. That I would. I'm gonna. I'm gonna push back on that one. I'm gonna say let Carry handle it. Because I noticed the time that you sent those emails last night.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:35:30.949Z)

Yeah. No, I'm not going to make it.

### You (2025-09-04T22:35:40.492Z)

Was like, four in the morning. That's. That's not right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:35:44.149Z)

Yeah. As I say, don't. Don't spend a lot of time on that. Yeah, no, I'm not going to create it, but I'll. I'll introduce you to some UX guys and, you know, they can help you out.

### You (2025-09-04T22:35:46.652Z)

Yeah. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:36:04.949Z)

All right. Anything else at this point.

### You (2025-09-04T22:36:11.612Z)

No, Drew, if you want to hang on for about two minutes, I can show you. You know, we talked about OneNote and how we could possibly format that. I'll show you what I put together. Just to give you an idea of what we've done in the past and whether it would help you with these meetings.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:36:24.069Z)

Yes. Y es. Yes. That should be good, y'all. Hang on.

### You (2025-09-04T22:36:32.812Z)

All right. Yeah. Let me pull that up and open it up here. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:36:36.549Z)

I also shared a LinkedIn URL here. Morgan had opened a digital manager opening recently. They had put some numbers there as well, just to get an idea of how much might cost. If you hire someone full time. I think it is similar profile that we were talking about. You do what you said to work on AI. No digital manager like marketing manager. Ok? Ay, Vanota. We had any inquiries on our website lately? No. No body in the waiting list. The traffic I. I haven't been tracking, but this no one in the waiting list. Zero. We were like I showed it on in the last meeting and we can see it again today as well. But this Barely anyone. Okay? No, just curious.

### You (2025-09-04T22:37:27.452Z)

Well, I don't think. Yeah, I don't think we're publishing it or making it known, so, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:37:32.309Z)

Pushing it out. Though. Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. All right, very good.

### You (2025-09-04T22:37:37.532Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:37:41.269Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-04T22:37:41.452Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:37:42.389Z)

All right, have a great night, everyone. Thanks.

### You (2025-09-04T22:37:46.572Z)

So, Drew, I'll pull that up real quick. All right, so let me know when you can see the notebook. Okay, got it.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:38:14.229Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-09-04T22:38:14.812Z)

All right, so in the InnVestAI notebook, I created this section called Weekly Updates. And so what I did is looking at the agenda how you had it set up. Right? So I created an operations section. And within that session. You've got the operating agreement, etc. Etc. Right? So what? Typically, you have to. You have to have something in here. If I were to delete this page. Well, let me see. You know what? I don't think we actually. Maybe we don't. No. Okay, Because I've already got these sections set up. We can do that. So when you set up a section in OneNote and you add another page, you can right click on these. And down here you can see, to make it a sub page, you can actually go three levels down. Right. So if we wanted to have another section part of the budget forecast. I can right click make it a sub property here so you can see then I can have different sub properties here. Or just promote it back to a regular page. But the way we would have it is this is how we've done it in the past. Right. So when we talk about operating agreements, we would have last week's notes. And then today we would start taking our new notes. Next week we'd have our new notes. So this just all grows and you have everything available? On one page. So everything pertaining to the operating agreement would be here. Then we can move on to the bank account, do the same thing. And one of the things that I really like is I had mentioned last week about. How you can do links directly to a certain spot here. So I say link to last weeks. Operating statement notes. And I can go in here. Operating statement. And if I put my cursor at the beginning and I right click right here, copy link to paragraph, so then I can go to the bank account. Page. And, you know, just highlight. Do what you normally would do, you know, shortcut command K. I don't know if you can see this or if it's blank, then just paste in the link. Put it in there. And so then I can just click on here, and it takes me right to the notes, right? So being able to jump from one note to another, if you have anything that's related on another page, you can do that. So now on the web version, you don't have the ability to do things like, you know, with the accordion here, to expand and contract, but, you know, you can set it up wherever you want. So you do whatever works best for you. I. I just mentioned in our call last week that we had it set up and that we've been using. Or that I've been using onenote from many, many years.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:41:01.989Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-04T22:41:29.772Z)

And found. It. This works really well for me. The problem is, if you use the web version. You can still make pages here. But it doesn't have the sub page abilities. So these would all just be in the straight row down here. Not as easy to navigate. But I don't know if you use the Web version, if you use a desktop version, but.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:41:58.069Z)

I started using the desktop version. I mean, I've not used it a whole lot, but I've started to use it, and it is pretty helpful.

### You (2025-09-04T22:42:04.572Z)

You can see there's. There's a lot more features here. And the same thing since it's, since it's in the Microsoft system, you can also have links to documents.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:42:05.109Z)

So I'm thinking.

### You (2025-09-04T22:42:15.532Z)

You can embed the documents like I mentioned last week with the Excel spreadsheet. You know, this can really be what I've always used it for is like my central command, where I can keep all of my notes linked to different documents linked to different notes within here. One note's getting better. I really do like it. It's one of the few Microsoft tools that I have really kind of stuck with, even though I'm in the map world now.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:42:47.029Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T22:42:49.532Z)

Yeah, so.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:42:50.309Z)

Yeah, okay.

### You (2025-09-04T22:42:51.692Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:42:51.989Z)

All right. Yeah, let me. The pages. Even though they're indented, they still act independently, right?

### You (2025-09-04T22:43:00.572Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It's just like having a hierarchy, Right? So under the customers, investors here.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:43:02.389Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T22:43:07.932Z)

You can jot notes on the main page if they're not related to something specific here, but you know, then your pitch deck is down below your one pagers, etc. And so, you know, whatever page you're on, whatever you're meeting. You just keep building on the notes.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:43:25.589Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T22:43:26.252Z)

Personally, I like to have the most recent on top. You know, so I would probably have, you know, each time I create a new note, I just go up to the top row, put in, you know, like, next week would be, you know, the 9 and 11, 20, 25 notes. You know, just go on, make my notes, etc. You know, then I. Below that by nine, four notes. To me, that's the. The way I prefer it. But some people will jump down to the bottom and, you know, go from oldest on top to newest on the bottom, whatever.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:43:53.029Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-04T22:44:03.692Z)

Whatever way you prefer. So, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:44:06.629Z)

Okay? All right, I'll just play around with this.

### You (2025-09-04T22:44:10.492Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:44:13.109Z)

Yeah, the budget piece, we probably have to finish it because there's no. You can't, like, embed and Excel like. I know you can put in yourself file in here, but you can't have Excel functionality directly on a OneNote page, right?

### You (2025-09-04T22:44:25.212Z)

No, you can. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:44:27.749Z)

I can put a table in there, like an Excel table.

### You (2025-09-04T22:44:28.412Z)

Yeah, you can go up. Well, you can. You can create a table. Right here. Of course. But that's not an Excel table. But yeah, you want to create an Excel spreadsheet? And then just go up here to insert file and then navigate to wherever that spreadsheet is saved. And then embed it here and then copy it so that you basically have two working versions of the spreadsheet. So if you're in. If you're in, Excel. Your changes will show here. If you're inserting data here. It'll be carried over. The thing is, though, with, like, Excel, It takes up an awful lot of space. So what you see here in this white area would be like just a few columns in just a few rows. And it's. It's not as easy to work in here. So, you know, you could do the other thing, too. You could just insert a link to the Excel here and just click on. Click on that and it'll take you right to the model. So either way,

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:45:33.109Z)

And then open it up. All right. I'll try out a few things.

### You (2025-09-04T22:45:40.332Z)

Yeah, yeah, just take a look.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:45:41.829Z)

Yeah. This is interesting. Yeah. Thank you for setting this up.

### You (2025-09-04T22:45:43.532Z)

Okay? Yep. Like I said, I won't be offended. You just do whatever works best for you. You're running these meetings, so.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:45:53.349Z)

All right. For now, anyway.

### You (2025-09-04T22:45:54.092Z)

Yeah. Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:45:56.949Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-04T22:45:57.612Z)

Yeah, just like I said earlier, just shoot me an email for early next week, whenever it works best for you, and we'll. We'll go over that stuff.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:46:07.189Z)

You don't include a Benot as well.

### You (2025-09-04T22:46:08.332Z)

Yeah. Yeah, include him. And. Yeah, I do. I kind of got the impression from him that he's not going into the office that often, and so he's. If he's working from home.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:46:19.749Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-04T22:46:22.492Z)

He'll carve out some time to join. Ok, cool. Yep, we'll see.

### Guest (2025-09-04T22:46:25.989Z)

Es. All right. Sounds good. Thanks, Howard.

### You (2025-09-04T22:46:29.292Z)

You.
