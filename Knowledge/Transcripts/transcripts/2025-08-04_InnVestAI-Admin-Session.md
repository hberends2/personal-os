### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:28.172Z)

I forgot to put my earphones in, that's why.

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:31.692Z)

I have not been feeling well the last few days, so if you don't mind. I'm just going to stay off camera today. Perfect.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:37.772Z)

Perfect. I'm just going to go off camera.

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:38.092Z)

I'm just going to be off camera, too.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:39.292Z)

Too. Then. All right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:39.772Z)

Right. All right. Happy Monday. I'm sorry.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:41.532Z)

Y. Happy Monday. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:42.892Z)

Feeling well.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:43.372Z)

Feeling well.

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:44.332Z)

Yeah. Thank you. Happy Monday to you. Just came down with what my wife had last week. So seems to be making the rounds. Is it like a flu or a cold?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:00:52.732Z)

Is it like a flu or a cold?

### You (2025-08-04T14:00:54.332Z)

Yeah. Kind of. It's little light fever, chills. Stomach. Just basic stuff. No big deal. I'm on the recovery side. Of it. So I think the worst has passed, but that's good. Were you able to just kind of put your head under the covers?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:01:11.612Z)

That's good. Were you able to just kind of put your head under the covers?

### You (2025-08-04T14:01:14.652Z)

Over the weekend.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:01:15.132Z)

Over the weekend. And just kind of sleep it off. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:01:17.932Z)

Yeah. We had a showing up at the cottage. But one of the things that the cottages is that the lake is not easy to maintain, right? It's not like a pool. And keeping the weeds and everything under control is just something that hasn't been on our list. We don't. We don't have kids that go swimming or anything. But we've had two showings, and according to the realtor, Both of them made negative comments about the condition of the lake and walking out on the dock. And all. You see our weeds. So there's a rake. That you can buy. That's probably $10 worth of materials. And they charge you $150 for it. But it's specifically for lakes and things like that. And it really did a great job. But yeah. I did that. Friday. And then Saturday was the showing, and I guess it was worthwhile. Because they want to put in an offer. But there has to be a contingency, and we said, we're not going to take a contingency. So hopefully it'll pay off if they are able to sell something. But then, like, Saturday afternoon,

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:02:40.812Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:02:47.132Z)

What really started to hit. So yeah. I spent most of the time up there just kind of lying around and recovering. So, are you guys selling the cottage?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:02:58.492Z)

So are you guys selling the cottage because of what's going on right now?

### You (2025-08-04T14:02:59.372Z)

Because what's going on right now?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:02.092Z)

With your work situation. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:04.492Z)

Sorry. That's all right. It's a nice place. I enjoy it. But I'm just looking forward to getting something better. When this thing takes off.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:17.292Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I have a lot of those things, too.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:19.212Z)

Those things, too. It's like, okay.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:20.252Z)

In my mind where it's like, okay.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:21.132Z)

Just get by a little bit.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:21.372Z)

Just goodbye. A little bit longer, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:22.892Z)

Longer.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:24.492Z)

Like, hang on, like. Well, I keep telling myself a few more months.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:24.652Z)

Hang on. I keep telling myself, if she wants a few more months, I hope that calm, labored and.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:28.492Z)

I really hope it is a few more months. I hope that calm labor day. We're able to, you know, get some, you know, if Dan's interested.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:35.452Z)

Dms interested? And a cardinal student.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:36.732Z)

And if Cardinal Student is interested. And you know.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:39.372Z)

Well, we've certainly got some people who have given some very positive feedback. And express some interest. So, yeah. I'm very optimistic about that. In fact, I wanted to talk a little bit about the budget.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:03:51.932Z)

In fact, I wanted to talk a little bit about the budget. And we can go in any order, but I wanted to show you where everyone stands with different decks. Because a lot happened last week with Dax between Mark and Drew and myself. All good.

### You (2025-08-04T14:03:54.812Z)

And we can go in any order. But I wanted to show you what stands but different ducks. Because a lot happened last week with deaths between Morocco and Drew and my salt. And it's really great to see Marlowe and Gangcheng as much as he engaged last week.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:08.492Z)

And it's really great to see Mark engaging. As much as he engaged last week.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:13.132Z)

So where should we start today?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:13.612Z)

So where should we start? Today.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:15.612Z)

Anywhere you want. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:17.532Z)

All right. Well, then why don't I start?

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:18.252Z)

Why don't I start?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:21.932Z)

And let me. Give me a second.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:22.412Z)

Give me a second. To share my screen.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:23.772Z)

To share my screen. Share Screen or window? I always forget screen. Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:33.852Z)

Either one if you share a screen. It'll show everything that you have. Well, you can show anything that's on the screen. Or if you share a window, it's just that window that you share. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:45.052Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:45.612Z)

Share screen.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:45.772Z)

I'll just share screen so you can say okay. So you can probably see lwa, right? Okay? So just so you have a sense of who we're talking about.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:55.452Z)

Who we're talking about.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:57.212Z)

This is dan lesser.

### You (2025-08-04T14:04:57.372Z)

This is dan lesser. And this is his partner, Heaven wise.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:04:59.772Z)

And this is his partner, Evan Weiss.

### You (2025-08-04T14:05:02.732Z)

And dan.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:05:03.212Z)

And Dan is if there's probably, I don't know.

### You (2025-08-04T14:05:06.092Z)

There's probably, I don't know, 5 is how people that I would say we call ourselves hoteliers.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:05:07.612Z)

Five to 10 people in the industry that I would say are. We call ourselves hoteliers. I don't know why we do that. But whether they're the. They are the hoteliers of the hoteliers.

### You (2025-08-04T14:05:17.932Z)

Of the botellier.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:05:20.572Z)

And I knew that dan and evan worked for cbre about 10, 15 years ago.

### You (2025-08-04T14:05:25.932Z)

S. And they took the entire hotel and bought this. All the clients with two form their own company.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:05:27.452Z)

And they took the entire hotel advisory practice, all the clients with them. When they left to form their own company. What Mark said that I didn't know, and then I can't remember if you guys were wrong. Is that prior to cbre, they were at Cushman and Wakefield, and they did the same thing. And then Dan was at the original hvs. And he did the same thing. There as well. So these guys are Dan speaks all the time. About a hotel? He's got. He posts all the time. On LinkedIn. Evan hardly ever posts. I think he's the one that actually runs the workings of the company.

### You (2025-08-04T14:06:06.252Z)

He's the one that actually runs the workings of the company.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:06:12.092Z)

But they are. What I want to show you is their very big team. And that is because most of the work they do is appraisal work.

### You (2025-08-04T14:06:20.012Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:06:21.532Z)

All right. So see, all these people? All these young people are cranking out appraisals. I have no idea why I'm telling you this. But it's just because it's background that I know. When I was at cbre, I got to know the head of the Northeastern Valuation Division. Like they broke it down by territories.

### You (2025-08-04T14:06:42.732Z)

Territory.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:06:43.772Z)

So he's based in new york. And dan and evan worked in new york. In the same office as him. Before they left. And we were talking one day, and it's like, well, would Dana ever. Dan and Evan ever come back? And he laughed and said, there's no way in hell they'd ever come back. Evan makes more than Tom Edwards. He makes something like $700,000.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:04.252Z)

Something like $700,000 a year.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:06.732Z)

A year. Some ass with some astronomical number for someone who just brought.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:06.812Z)

Or some house. With some astronomical.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:13.372Z)

Yeah. So this is that. This is the group of people now when Dan says he's potentially interested in investing.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:19.132Z)

Ly interested investing.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:21.772Z)

What Mark says he's maybe interested in investing.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:23.932Z)

On Dan service account.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:24.332Z)

On dan lesser's account. Perhaps not on all LW's account. And I don't know how many of these other. There's a couple other senior people here. I mean, you can see by kind of by their ages.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:29.372Z)

And I don't know how many of these other. There's a couple of senior people here.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:37.292Z)

Right. How senior that they are.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:38.652Z)

That they are.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:42.332Z)

They? Lark is an associated company.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:45.132Z)

Associated company.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:07:47.692Z)

Is it under predictive analytics? Maybe. Here it is. Predictive analytics. So this is lark. And this is what Drew talks about all the time.

### You (2025-08-04T14:07:59.532Z)

All the time. And this is what.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:00.812Z)

And this is what I mean. They really are getting the lion's share of people wanting this data.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:05.612Z)

People want.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:09.612Z)

And they have a really good GIS program, too.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:11.532Z)

To talk about.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:11.612Z)

We haven't talked about that at all.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:13.372Z)

But I don't know if there's a picture.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:14.012Z)

But I don't know if there's a picture of Ryan Millike here. Or not. So appraisal and valuation. I swear, this has to be probably 80% of what they do.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:23.692Z)

I swear, this has to be probably 80% of what they do.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:27.772Z)

And so it's going to be interesting for them.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:28.572Z)

But it's going to be interesting for them because of the.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:30.172Z)

Because of the fee compression that's going to happen in appraisal work. With avms hitting the market.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:38.172Z)

Market.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:39.532Z)

They do some asset management work. But I wouldn't say that they are out there as much as some of the other competitors, like the woman who owns Single Pane.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:41.852Z)

I would say that they are out there as much as some of the other competitors. Single pay.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:51.532Z)

They do advisory services. They do a fair amount of this. And they make a boatload of money. On dispute analysis.

### You (2025-08-04T14:08:58.652Z)

Experts witness es.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:08:58.892Z)

Like expert witness work. This is where There's a lot of money in this, but it's very hard.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:04.572Z)

Very stressful.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:04.732Z)

It's very stressful. So I just thought you meant this is. So you know who Dan is. Let me see. If they have his clients listed here. Lenders, hotel companies, law firms, municipalities,

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:18.412Z)

Ities.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:21.452Z)

I don't know why these. These must have been hotels that they've appraised or something like that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:22.172Z)

Must have been parties or something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:25.212Z)

I don't know why. They would pick certain hotels over the other. Projects. Future projects, just showing that they, I mean, that they are the.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:33.532Z)

Showing that they are.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:37.372Z)

So that's dan lesser.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:39.772Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:41.452Z)

All right. So last week, what happened was Mark sat down and did a very good job.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:42.012Z)

So last week. Of putting together.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:50.012Z)

Of putting together. What he thinks the talking points of our pitch to clients should be.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:53.932Z)

Talking points of our pitch to clients should be.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:58.412Z)

And I couldn't make it the afternoon.

### You (2025-08-04T14:09:59.372Z)

After.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:09:59.932Z)

That he and Drew went over this. But they went over it. And, I mean, this is pretty much Mark's writing, which is all fantastic.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:10.892Z)

So he put this all into.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:11.212Z)

So he put this all into a Word document. I do want to point out that we did have a conversation about titles.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:17.212Z)

Conversation about titles.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:19.452Z)

Where we didn't come across with titles. But Drew didn't love the idea of being an analytics officer. He felt like he would. He's a chief operating officer of his current company.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:23.692Z)

The idea of being an analytics officer. He's a chief operating officer of his current company.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:32.652Z)

And so he mentioned that he wanted to keep that title.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:36.572Z)

The way I say.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:36.572Z)

And the way I see it, How are these are just titles, right? I mean, like, the five of us are working so well.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:41.852Z)

Well together.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:42.412Z)

Together. That. It's like this is more for the outside world. Than it is for the inside. I was not sure what Mark would do. I gave him some ideas about capital markets or maybe being a president or something.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:50.892Z)

About capital market ing president or something.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:55.212Z)

He chose this.

### You (2025-08-04T14:10:55.852Z)

Himself, I guess.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:10:56.092Z)

Himself. I guess. So he's chief commercial Officer.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:00.732Z)

Products and technology.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:00.732Z)

And then product and technology.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:01.852Z)

So this was my last name is misspelled there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:02.412Z)

So this was what Mark did. Oh, it is? Well, that's very good. To know. Hold on. Oh, it is very. It is very misspelled, so we'll have to fix that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:12.972Z)

Because transferred into.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:13.612Z)

Because this got transferred into. Got it. Hold on. Let me go back and get it from the email.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:32.252Z)

Email. Securit.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:38.572Z)

So Drew took what Mark did and he put it into an AI platform.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:43.052Z)

Ization.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:44.412Z)

Like an AI you know, slide generator. And generated this. It took him literally, I think, three minutes. He literally just put what Mark put in here. And this is what we're going to be using today.

### You (2025-08-04T14:11:55.532Z)

Today. To talk to.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:11:59.452Z)

To talk to Dan. We are going to put in the screenshots that you shared. Drew's doing that. She's going to lead the discussion, and then Mark's going to chime in. We decided to do it that way because Druid originally set up the call with Ryan.

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:06.172Z)

Discussion. Because Drewitt originally set up the call with Ryan. Hold on a second. Here. I'm also seeing, like, on that side. InnVestAI is misspelled.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:21.292Z)

Because it's not altogether.

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:22.732Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:25.612Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:26.092Z)

Capital lie to lower case. It's not like we've been using, okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:31.292Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:34.252Z)

Yeah, Somebody should probably go through here. And just do.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:39.052Z)

Check it. And. And so this is going to be good. I'm going to get to see Mark do a pitch for the first time.

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:49.212Z)

A text for the first time. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:50.412Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:50.652Z)

So that's what we good for me to see.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:12:50.812Z)

So this will be good for me to see. And ready to revolutionize your hotel investment process.

### You (2025-08-04T14:12:56.812Z)

Hotel investment process. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:00.892Z)

Okay? So this is what we're using for Dan.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:03.692Z)

I'm sure this will turn into a for client pitches.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:04.092Z)

I'm sure this will turn into a version that we are using for client pitches. And then what I had been working on, and this is about 50% the way through.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:14.652Z)

About 50% the way through.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:19.692Z)

Is an investor pitch deck.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:21.612Z)

An investor. And I did a lot of research. I do template.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:24.012Z)

And I got this. I did a lot of research on trying to find a good template. I think it's a Richard Thiel who's One of the PayPal founders. He's famous.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:30.252Z)

It's a retrofit.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:35.372Z)

By. Some people hate him, some people love him, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:36.172Z)

Some people will say claimed that this was a template that you used, but there's, like, literally 50% missing. Right. So slide isn't gone.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:38.572Z)

This site claimed that this was a template that he's used, but it's not. I mean, there's, like, literally 50% missing. Right. So, like, I don't. This slide isn't done.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:48.172Z)

But I did try to work on the problem.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:48.492Z)

But I did try to work on the problem.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:51.132Z)

Just like Mark did. We kind of stated the problem in the same way.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:51.772Z)

Just like mark did. We. Kind of stated the problem in the same way, just a little bit differently.

### You (2025-08-04T14:13:56.172Z)

A little bit differently. The solution.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:13:58.092Z)

The solution. I need to need some more work on that. I need more work on this.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:01.772Z)

On this slide.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:02.652Z)

Slide.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:04.092Z)

But I did some good work.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:04.172Z)

But I did some good work on getting all our competitors down.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:06.652Z)

On getting all our competitors down. Putting a slide in there about going to the data, because I just think that's going to come up in conversation.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:10.892Z)

Putting a slide in there about who owns the data. Because I just think that's going to come up in conversation. I'm going to work on the TAM and the ARR, and then we've talked about the pricing strategy.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:20.412Z)

And then we talked about the pricing strategy. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:22.892Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:22.972Z)

That we just like with it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:23.132Z)

That we need a slide for this.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:25.292Z)

Which hopefully will have something by end of day or tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:30.652Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:34.652Z)

I would be hesitant to put down a specific pricing strategy on here. Because there's many options. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:14:44.092Z)

I agree. Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:14:46.332Z)

We can maybe instead of saying a specific pricing. Definitely don't want to include numbers. We're not going to say yeah. We're going to charge $1,000 a month. Or something like that. But we do want to at least have some idea of. Yeah, I think focus on the word strategy rather than the word pricing. Right. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:07.852Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:08.572Z)

Let me work on that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:08.652Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:10.012Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:10.652Z)

Okay? I will need to have to include numbers.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:12.732Z)

Food numbers. I would think on the tml.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:13.692Z)

Though, I think, on the tam and the ARR, right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:15.132Z)

Those. Yeah, I'm just talking about, like, if we do a subscription.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:16.812Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:19.212Z)

Or we don't know what the price tag is going to be on the product.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:19.292Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:23.052Z)

Yet, but we do know how we can go about the strategy. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:28.332Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:28.492Z)

And pricing is going to change a lot.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:28.732Z)

And pricing is going to change a lot. In the next year too, right? While we're working on this. This is another financial projection. I don't know if I like this slide or not.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:38.812Z)

Of.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:38.972Z)

I might take it out.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:42.172Z)

Our titles.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:42.412Z)

Our titles are wrong. Oh, no. Did I fix our titles? Yet. I need to clean this up a little bit. But I tried to pull our pictures in. I feel. Go ahead.

### You (2025-08-04T14:15:51.932Z)

I would suggest on mine and vinodes that we take out multifamily because that doesn't seem to fit in with what we're doing.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:15:57.292Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:01.612Z)

Somebody might say, well, why are they involved if they're multifamily? Right. Or the second question is, oh, you're going to be making this for multifamily, too.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:16:02.012Z)

Right. Yeah, okay. Got it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:12.972Z)

Probably. You probably might cause few too many questions.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:16:13.772Z)

Got it. To confusion. Okay? Milestones. I think this is. I mean, I'll go back and look at this one more time, but I did spend.

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:23.292Z)

One more time.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:16:24.972Z)

Quite a bit of time just trying to think about how to put something out there.

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:25.612Z)

Just trying to take something out there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:16:28.572Z)

From a milestone's perspective. Even though we haven't been. Well, we've been working on this for a long time.

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:31.212Z)

Will be an.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:16:36.092Z)

And then what it said is, you need to be able to have a clear slide that clearly delineates how you're going to spend the money, and it doesn't mean to be a full budget. It just means to say, like, 30% of our budget is going to technology or whatever.

### You (2025-08-04T14:16:53.452Z)

That's a good way of them determining where are you in the timeline, right? I mean, do you need funds? For marketing and growth? Or do you need funds to get started right? So, yeah, I think the way you've got this laid out is good.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:17:09.372Z)

Okay? I just threw two slides in here. There's. They're not format at all. But for AI, like just to try to just maybe talk about predictive versus generative, structured versus unstructured, you know, or something along those lines.

### You (2025-08-04T14:17:15.532Z)

Just to try to talk about it. Along those lines. If you want to get together or if you want to take a look at. Trello board on the team site where we've got the AI ideas. We can probably put together a timeline if you and I want to work on that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:17:48.012Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:17:48.332Z)

Of what do we expect? At the very beginning. In fact, I put together that document. Let me send you that, because that actually breaks it down into phases.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:17:59.372Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:17:59.852Z)

That might be something that you can actually show a timeline. So they don't expect it to be all available in version one.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:09.932Z)

One. And everything I read said, keep this short. I'm probably going long at 20 slides, but I just think because of the AI piece of it,

### You (2025-08-04T14:18:16.572Z)

Slide.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:20.332Z)

And the data. Like, who owns the data?

### You (2025-08-04T14:18:21.692Z)

The data.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:23.052Z)

There's just certain things that aren't in the template that I had that I'm like, oh, but this is just going to come up in conversation.

### You (2025-08-04T14:18:23.612Z)

Type that are in the template that I have. Come up in conversation. So this slide really comes out.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:29.852Z)

So this slide probably comes out. And maybe we can get the AI into one slide. So this is where I'm probably, I don't know, 50% through, but I hope to be done by this by the end of the week so that we can all review it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:18:38.332Z)

I'm probably 50% group, but I will do this. By the end of the week. So we can all review it. And then it be done with it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:45.692Z)

And then just be done with this and we can start to show it to people come Labor Day.

### You (2025-08-04T14:18:47.612Z)

We can start to show it to people. Do we have a logo that we've decided on?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:18:55.452Z)

Now. I mean, I love what Vinod did. Don't get me wrong.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:00.092Z)

And it doesn't even have to be the final logo. One of the things I'm thinking this is maybe in the top left corner. Or the bottom right corner. Someplace that we just on slides have our logo to. Really? Okay.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:13.532Z)

Yep. Okay? Repeat over and over again.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:17.772Z)

Just kind of drill into their heads. So they don't forget. InnVestAI right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:24.092Z)

Right. And Drew did a better job at that in his AI I mean, I actually almost like this blue template background.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:28.412Z)

I actually almost like this blue template.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:31.452Z)

Better.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:32.012Z)

It's very nice. So you are in PowerPoint, though, right? Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:38.332Z)

Yes. And he is in and you can't. The thing about these AI platform. Oh, you probably know this as well.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:44.732Z)

As well. Because, you know.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:45.532Z)

Because you know more about AI. It doesn't allow you to create, like, dense slides. It's kind of hard.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:47.932Z)

To create dense slides. It's kind of hard. You have to keep it really high.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:52.252Z)

You have to keep it really high level or else.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:53.132Z)

Level.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:56.732Z)

But our logo would look a lot better.

### You (2025-08-04T14:19:58.012Z)

Would look a lot better in this blue.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:19:59.772Z)

This blue color scheme.

### You (2025-08-04T14:20:01.932Z)

I was going to say. In PowerPoint there is a designer. Tab. Can you pop back to PowerPoint? I just don't know if the version you're looking at has it. This guy up here? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:20:16.972Z)

This guy up here, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:20:20.572Z)

You can take a look at some of those. You can push the button.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:20:25.852Z)

That's got blue. I mean, blue. Blue's nice because our logos are blue.

### You (2025-08-04T14:20:28.652Z)

Because our blue. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:20:32.732Z)

Purple.

### You (2025-08-04T14:20:33.452Z)

The thing I don't necessarily like about it. Is. Sometimes it does different suggestions for each page. Which, depending on what's on there, It might be, but. This actually kind of works. Okay. I just try to put something on there. But that's my.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:20:54.652Z)

Like that's nice and blue. Right. I'm good at creating the content. I'm terrible. At creating the design.

### You (2025-08-04T14:21:09.932Z)

Designer either. I mean, I can get the. Like, you. I can get the content. Do layout of. Pictures, stuff like that. But yeah. When it comes to backgrounds and colors. And things.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:21:25.292Z)

Forward and back. Like, who's got to go to the back? Who's got to go to the front. That's what I want. To throw my computer against the wall. Let's see if there's anything. Else. So, yeah, I think that's it. One thing I wanted to add. On the budget is we're thinking you and Vinodo to work on this together.

### You (2025-08-04T14:21:42.012Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:21:45.532Z)

But bringing an engineer in who has AI experience to work with Vinod and his team.

### You (2025-08-04T14:21:53.292Z)

Should I? Just because it seems like 180 group stop.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:21:53.852Z)

Should I just use. I mean, just because it is. Should I just use 180? Gross. Stop for benefits and stuff? Or. Or 150 or. What number should I use?

### You (2025-08-04T14:22:05.692Z)

I would probably feel better if Vinod gave you a number. I don't know. Somebody like that. A year ago probably would have gotten around 250 or more.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:22:22.412Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:22:23.292Z)

But now, with the market being the way it is, And everything else. I'm sure that that probably has dropped a lot. Especially with AI tools.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:22:36.892Z)

Oh, it hasn't gone up because they have the knowledge.

### You (2025-08-04T14:22:38.252Z)

Because. No, because actually, a lot of those AI tools, you don't need to have that specialized knowledge anymore. But we're not really looking for an AI developer in terms of just building a tool. Needs somebody who has direct experience in AI. To show what we could do. And that's why I'm torn between do we want a developer with AI experience to build something, or would we want to bring in a junior product manager? Who has guided done product management for AI Tools. So yeah. I think I'm not 100% clear either way. Which one would be the best. I do know of Node is a little concerned about getting too many developers. Simply because the AI tools are making it so that they can develop things so fast. That we may be a bottleneck. Making decisions on the roadmap and deciding okay. This is what we're going to do. Now go build it. I think he's afraid that they might be sitting around waiting for us to make those decisions.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:24:11.292Z)

Yeah. Like that weekend, right where we. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:24:13.772Z)

Maybe if you even know now, I can just get on a call and we can just kind of talk it all through.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:24:14.012Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:24:18.492Z)

I think that would be.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:24:21.452Z)

The other thing I have is the question about is we're going to need just boatloads of API integrations. And so what does that cost? How are we going to handle that? You know what I mean? Because that's.

### You (2025-08-04T14:24:31.532Z)

Another thing. I don't think we need a boatload of APIs. There's different ways of going about it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:24:40.092Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:24:40.972Z)

It depends. An API is basically taking and mapping. A data element from our database. To another database. Or vice versa. And APIs are becoming just like, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:25:03.452Z)

Obsolete, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:25:04.092Z)

It's like some of them you don't even need to develop. You can do plug and play.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:25:11.292Z)

The word they're using, too, is agents. Are they using the word agents since? Or am I misunderstanding?

### You (2025-08-04T14:25:17.612Z)

Agent is more of an a. An A.I. so an agent. Those are the things that I've been working on for the research. So where we could use agentic AI is. A user creates a deal. And they want to get more detailed information on that market. So remember that report that I put together using genspark on the Arts Hotel? That's basically an agentic AI tool. And so rather than having just one AI query that goes out and does things and it'll go here.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:25:51.692Z)

Y.

### You (2025-08-04T14:26:01.852Z)

To get tax information or whatever. Basically, an agent is like a worker bee. Right. So you put in a query, and then different agents will go and do different things. So one agent might go specifically to look at the tax information. Another agent, different sites to get this previous sale information. Another one might go out and get general market information. And I mean, you have all these different nations, but then it's the Master AI. They literally call them like Manager AIs, then takes all that. Information that the worker bees come back with. Consolidated refine it. If there's still some missing information, it can direct an agent to go and find something. It's literally a team.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:26:51.052Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:26:55.932Z)

On your staff. And you've got a manager who coordinates. Who does what? And then they come back and report it's much faster. And weight gets way more accurate Detail. Because every agent also comes back with, Here is where I found this information. So very little hallucination because they're going out. To specific sites and Web pages. And it comes back, it'll have the link you can click. That'll take you right back to it. So that would be the agentic AI Is what we're looking at there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:27:33.372Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:27:34.172Z)

Which is.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:27:35.132Z)

Howard. How does it work? So say I'm a company. And I talk about them all the time. They're very hard to penetrate because the company is called Noble Hotel Investment, and they are the most successful select service real estate fund. Right. So they're going out to pension funds and sovereign wealth clients and stuff like that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:27:47.532Z)

The most successful select service real estate fund s. And stuff like that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:27:56.332Z)

They only do select service, they do development, they buy. And they're getting into the lending space. They consider themselves to be the best of the best of the best. When it comes to data and technology. So when I've pitched them in the past, just even me just helping them out. And they're like, well, no, there's no one better than us. They're going to be companies out there. Who are testing this on their own. Right, AI. So how are we going to differentiate that we can do something better? Than they can.

### You (2025-08-04T14:28:33.132Z)

That's a good question. I think. In a lot of cases. AI is AI is AI. And what they do with AI and what we do with AI is really going to be very similar. We're going to go to the same website. So we're going to get the same information. What you do with the data. That you get from AI that's going to differentiate. So that's where we need to. That's what we need to focus on. So getting the data with an API or getting the data with a query. Is pretty basic stuff. But number one. You need to make sure you're getting the right data. And making sure that the data is accurate. And that you're not going out and getting any data that can't be validated or whatever. So that's where if we were trying to get data from our clients, where we're getting. They're pushing their data into our system, which is definitely the best, right? That's a pretty simple thing. Because they have to map their database to hours. Right? So we would not have to go out. We could. We would assist them. And make sure they're making the correct changes. But when you talk about a boatload of APIs, that's really kind of the other way around, where we have one API. It says this API. This connection has to go here. We would have all these different database fields. Mapped out, and then they would have to go and say, oh, well, in our database. It's this table and this field that matches what you have there. And so somebody on their end has to map this data. Once that's done. It's done. The data goes back and forth. Very easily. So that way you know that it's totally accurate data. Up to date. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:30:59.852Z)

I think, though, just because using Noble is, like, the best example. Up there. Are probably like everyone else we talk to. They're testing AI, they're getting data. They're getting data feeds from their operators. In the same way. Drew's getting data feed. It's not live. Right. They're just sending a static file. Every month. An analyst or someone in feasibility is then pulling up into a power BI dashboard. They love their power bi dashboard.

### You (2025-08-04T14:31:28.972Z)

Figuring out how to.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:31:29.292Z)

They're probably figuring out how to. Pull in static documents like om, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:31:34.172Z)

Step down.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:31:38.252Z)

And it's no longer called ocr. You said it was that there's another term, so they're probably doing that. Already. They may be connecting into real estate tax databases. And chav them and stuff like that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:31:49.852Z)

Stuff like that. So.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:31:51.612Z)

So somehow we're going to have to think among ourselves. What is it? We do. I guess it's that we can line up. I'm talking out loud. Here for a minute? But that part of it is the avm, right? That we can instantaneously link up. And the way we treat the comparables, how we'll create, like, get their own little storage container for them. And stuff like that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:32:18.892Z)

Yeah, you're right. And I think the bottom line is data is data. And costar, all these different organizations. Are going out to the same people. The same people are giving in the same data. So it's what you do with the data that really separates everybody else. From each other, right? How clear of a report are you putting together? So again, I think what's going to differentiate us is, number one, we're dealing with seven specific Personas. We're not just getting data for investors or we're not just getting data for brokers. I mean, we've got all these different Personas that we're working with. We're going to have that forward looking data where we're not extrapolating or using a formula to try to predict what's going on. We'll have actual user hard input data into our tools. Used. So definitely more accurate than somebody's algorithm. But I also think there will be things like, one of the things I just can't wait to do is the marketplace. And get that direct connection between the brokers and investors. That's a moat. Once we start getting an active marketplace where brokers are listing deals. In our users are buying those deals. Getting in there. That's going to at least for that. Market segment really be a moat that other companies out there will have a hard time breaking. Into, right? Because right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:34:15.532Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:34:15.692Z)

And the american.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:34:16.412Z)

And they might be doing it for the other commercial property types, but again, hotels are very unique and the type of data that's needed, you just can't do it. With. Even Revere is trying, right? And they might be able to get a picture and some basic information, but it's just way more, way more complex than that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:34:30.732Z)

Information. But.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:34:38.652Z)

Yes. I can't wait till we get a marketplace. Too. Would it be worthwhile? Asking Vinod's team to. If you and Vinod and I were to sit down and say okay. Here are 20 different platforms. That we think are just doing a great job. These are platforms.

### You (2025-08-04T14:34:56.652Z)

These are hard work.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:34:57.692Z)

We might want to connect with. Or these are platforms that will never connect with, but we just think they're killing it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:04.012Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:04.332Z)

So, like, I might say, elise. AI right. They're using it for property management.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:08.092Z)

Property management. We would.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:09.852Z)

We wouldn't use it. But, like, what are they doing? Because they're winning awards. Left and right. And they're getting all these accolades.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:18.732Z)

Put Harvey out there because.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:18.812Z)

I would put Harvey on there because of the legal workflows. Procore on there because of the capex workflows. If we were to go through and say, I would put Revere on there. And say okay.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:33.132Z)

How can we divvy this up so that you guys have.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:33.612Z)

How can we divvy this up? So that you guys have a. You know, if you even have downtime, when one thing you could do in your downtime is go in and just start to study these platforms.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:43.132Z)

To study this platform. Figure out what they're doing.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:45.212Z)

And figure out what they're doing and how they're doing it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:46.092Z)

And how they're doing it. Yeah. I think that would be something that you and I would work on.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:52.892Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:54.012Z)

Unless they have some proprietary technical data background.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:58.332Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:35:58.492Z)

It wouldn't be something that the node.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:35:59.372Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:00.492Z)

I mean, we shouldn't distract him. From something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:03.852Z)

Got it. Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:04.972Z)

But you and I could easily go do that. Now. Who was that platform? That we were just talking about a minute ago where you said that they considered themselves the best.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:15.052Z)

It's noble. It's an investor. And you can still see my screen, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:16.892Z)

I can still see my screen. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:22.252Z)

Noble Hotel Investment Group. And the principal is Mitch Shaw. And I would give my left arm to have Mid Shawby and advocate for us because he's constantly speaking about data. But they are an investor.

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:34.252Z)

Because he constantly speaking about data. But they are business for 30 years.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:40.732Z)

They've been in business for 30 years. The team, like the core team, has been together 20 years.

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:43.852Z)

The core team has been together 20 years. I think that close to 100.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:47.452Z)

I think they have close to 100 hotels now.

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:50.172Z)

They're starting a debt function.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:50.412Z)

They're starting a debt function.

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:51.932Z)

They're based in.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:36:52.572Z)

They're based in Atlanta. This is Midshaw. He talks everywhere. He's like. He's got these amazing relationships.

### You (2025-08-04T14:36:59.292Z)

These relationships. With all the brand.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:00.972Z)

With all the Berends They're a vertically integrated and they're truly not vertically integrated because they don't property manage. They used to, but they don't anymore.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:10.172Z)

New alarm.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:11.932Z)

And so they have a great relationship with host, the gym. Rizzolio is the CEO of host, which is the largest hotel reit.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:13.852Z)

Relationship with Host. And I want to mention this to me.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:21.692Z)

And I want to mention this. Too, because Host is one of the six hospitality investors in Fifth Wall.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:26.572Z)

Hospitality. Investors in.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:29.932Z)

Right. So it's like Jim Rosolio is also a person.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:32.732Z)

The loom is also a present that we need to be looking back immediately.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:34.252Z)

That we need to be eventually, not. Immediately, but eventually talking to his team.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:37.372Z)

But eventually talking to his team.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:43.452Z)

Okay? Their team is again. This is Mitt. This is their chief investment officer.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:48.012Z)

This is our chief investor officer. This.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:37:52.252Z)

Adi is their chief debt or capital markets person. Steve is their head of asset management. He's a little bit difficult.

### You (2025-08-04T14:37:54.652Z)

Capital markets person. Difficult. He's best friends.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:00.892Z)

He's best friends.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:01.452Z)

With long term competitors.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:01.772Z)

With one of Drew's competitors. And so he can be, like, just difficult to get around. George is their chief investment officer. I know I'm very well. From past life. Kevin is their head of construction.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:13.932Z)

Construction.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:16.012Z)

Angela just joined from fifth Wall. And so she and I spent some time together over the past couple months.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:20.492Z)

Time together over the past couple months.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:24.572Z)

We had coffee for an hour, and she said, when we're ready. She? We could walk her through our pitch. And she would give us feedback.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:34.092Z)

She would introduce me to a woman.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:34.252Z)

And that she would introduce me to a woman at fifth Wall. That's not like a senior person, but again, would be a good person to have just a female friend.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:36.812Z)

At this wall. That's not like a senior person. But again, be a good person to live out.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:44.492Z)

To have on. And then they're seeing and then they go down and then who they've got is their. FP and a guy that's like, I think he must be really amazing.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:54.172Z)

I think you must be.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:38:57.372Z)

This guy. I think he is the one that does. Pulls all the data in through Power Bi and stuff like that.

### You (2025-08-04T14:38:58.812Z)

The one that does. Power beyond stuff like that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:39:07.532Z)

And then they're really for what they do. They're really not that big of a team. I know it looks. Well, it's looking like more and more people every day. But they do construct. They do the construction too as well. So these guys think they are, like, they already pull all the RCA comps, and they pull Lark, and they pull. I mean, I can't even tell you all the other stuff that they pulled. But what they don't do, though, is they do not. They use juniper square. And they use Yardi, but they have not been able to connect their data up from where it's coming up through their FP and A guys.

### You (2025-08-04T14:39:46.892Z)

Coming up through.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:39:50.092Z)

And then in the Arty and then into Juniper Square.

### You (2025-08-04T14:39:52.412Z)

Square.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:39:53.932Z)

And so I feel like that's another area that can really differentiate us.

### You (2025-08-04T14:39:57.132Z)

S.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:39:58.572Z)

Yardi's a bitch. And it's really hard to, like, you have to have workarounds, from what I understand, but.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:02.812Z)

From what I understand. They're difficult to work with.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:08.172Z)

If you can somehow get that linen, even if you have to do some work around with Yardi. Like to be able to say to a group like Noble. Well, yes.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:09.132Z)

That. Maybe you have to do some work to be able to say.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:17.292Z)

Use InnVestAI, but the other thing we can do for you is we can help you get your data connected all the way up to Juniper Square. That would be something that I think they'd be very interested in.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:19.692Z)

Help you get your data connected all the way to Jericho Square. Interested in. So do I understand correctly, then, that when you were talking about that they're proud of their data? They think they've got the best data in the industry. They're not selling this data externally. This is just internal. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:45.212Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:45.212Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:46.412Z)

But they're going to be, like, the hardest customer. Imagine them. As we pitch them and they'll roll their eyes. And say we're doing this ourselves.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:53.292Z)

We're doing this ourselves. Why did you take this?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:54.972Z)

Why do we need you to do this? For us.

### You (2025-08-04T14:40:56.892Z)

We're going to get that from a lot of people. We're not everybody's. Not everybody's going to be a client.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:40:59.532Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:41:01.692Z)

But want to listen to what they're saying. And it'll help us determine how we can what we change in order to make them want to join.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:41:10.652Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:41:17.132Z)

Okay? Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:41:20.012Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:41:20.412Z)

Let's do that. So we do have a couple of things. Couple action items. Let's schedule a call with Vinod to talk about AI development, et cetera. Try to determine. If we need to bring somebody on, would they be best as part of the product team, or would they be best as part of the engineering team? And then if you and I can start looking at some of those tech leaders that you had mentioned. I'm very familiar. Elise and a few other. They have a big multifamily presence.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:41:58.812Z)

Yep. But now what you were doing, right? So yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:42:02.332Z)

But that's one thing I'm thinking is that would be a good project for genspark or some of those other AI tools that are research tools. Together list. Here are five leaders in the commercial real estate prop tech. What makes them the leader. And let search go through and find what's the common thread. What are they doing that makes them so successful? And just basically use that as part of R guideline. Is it their marketing? Is it their product? Is it? What is it? Would be a good opportunity. For us to learn and implement some of those things.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:42:49.772Z)

Good. Good. I love that idea. Right? Because that's what we're going to have to do, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:42:53.612Z)

It's like people aren't moving very quickly.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:42:54.412Z)

It's like people are. I mean, it's just moving very quickly. And I hope two years from now we can enter the Cretech Awards.

### You (2025-08-04T14:43:00.812Z)

Because I 'll put either the beginning.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:43:03.692Z)

Put our name up and be up for either the beginning or a mid market, like award winner, because that's where I find a lot of these. I'm like, wait. You just walk on a green deck? You must be doing pretty good. There. What's like. What do you have up to? What are you doing?

### You (2025-08-04T14:43:18.652Z)

That's interesting.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:43:18.972Z)

That's so interesting. Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:43:22.012Z)

One of the things we should also discuss is looking at some of these incubators. Because when we talk to. Well, I forgot her name now already.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:43:31.612Z)

Yes. Jessica.

### You (2025-08-04T14:43:35.052Z)

When we talked to her, she had mentioned incubators and stuff. And that's what Rapidia is being best program is. I've been holding off contacting Bryce and whatever. I. At some point, I would at least like to have a short conversation to find out what are the requirements. What benefits of doing something like this?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:43:53.932Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:43:58.492Z)

Because if they are truly an incubator and if they are putting in, if they are actually investing. In some of these companies, that would be another source of revenue. CBRE or Cushman Wakefield. They have something similar. We can certainly do that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:44:19.292Z)

Y. Eah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:44:22.812Z)

And one of the things I was really surprised at is there are quite a few members of the be engaged that are not multifamily related. So some of them, I could tell they were pure investment plays because I really didn't see any fit Berkadia environment. They weren't related to brokerage. They weren't related to Opry. Some of them are just. Different sectors altogether. I don't think it has to be. Something directly related to brokerage or anything, but we would be. They've got a hospitality team. Give us a break.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:45:10.972Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:45:13.212Z)

Maybe I'll just go ahead and give Bryce a call one of these days and just start getting some basic information.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:45:20.652Z)

You should. You totally should. Right? Because, I mean, you know, again, it's Jared Kelso who introduced us, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:45:23.612Z)

It's very.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:45:26.252Z)

So he's the piece, the contact there. I think I've talked through, like Jared and I, our industry friends.

### You (2025-08-04T14:45:32.172Z)

Friends. But Jared actually needs children.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:45:33.052Z)

But Jared actually used to work for Mark, like, way back in the day. That's how incestuous we all are.

### You (2025-08-04T14:45:39.132Z)

We all are. So there's a lot of connections between Arcadia.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:45:40.812Z)

So there's just a lot of connections between Berkadia and us that would be great if we could use them to our full advantage.

### You (2025-08-04T14:45:44.332Z)

And all this. That would be great. Oh, speaking of which. I was really upset that when I left Radix, I used Microsoft OneNote for years. And I had a massive one note file. Going all the way back to the day I started at Berkadia And since it was under my. Berkadia and then later Radix email. I could no longer access it. And I thought, man, I lost, like, five years of notes. And then the other day, I took on my iPad. And I opened up Microsoft notes. And guess where it's still signed into.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:46:41.692Z)

Yes. Yes.

### You (2025-08-04T14:46:42.332Z)

I do have all of my notes, including. It's like all these conversations that we had with Jared and his team and all these other notes that I had were gone. Well, now I've got them back again.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:46:57.852Z)

Goodness. Can you download all that? Into like before they.

### You (2025-08-04T14:47:01.692Z)

I don't know. It's not connected, obviously. Anymore.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:47:06.412Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-08-04T14:47:06.732Z)

But at least I have it. So I could probably have to copy and paste or do something, and I'd have to do it in my iPad.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:47:09.052Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:47:14.492Z)

Which it's time consuming.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:47:16.252Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T14:47:16.972Z)

But maybe I'll just keep it there. And just refer to it as needed. Rather than trying to set everything all up again. But there were names.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:47:25.772Z)

Yeah.

I had clients that I spoke to with their contact information that I thought it'd be nice if we could touch base with them. Did have hospitality. Oh, my gosh. All of these contacts and conversations. And everything, they were just gone. And I was very happy when I came across that.

That's how I feel about some of my Excel underwriting models. When you said, send me an Excel. Underwriting model. I wanted to cry. It's like. On the servers of the people. That I worked for. And maybe I'll find one or two stray ones.

### You (2025-08-04T14:48:06.412Z)

I look at it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:48:06.652Z)

And I look at it and it's like, oh, yeah. Anyway. All right. Very good. So I'll let you know how the 130 call goes with Dan and with Ryan Millike and then I. And then we'll Talk tomorrow at 5:30. I'm going to go get those calls for this week.

### You (2025-08-04T14:48:20.732Z)

And then we'll talk to our 5:30. Don't get those calls for this week. On our. Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:48:24.492Z)

On our calendars.

### You (2025-08-04T14:48:25.692Z)

That's what I was going to say. All right. So I'll send you that AI implementation document that I have, that the timeline, so you implement that. I do want to spend some time researching noble investment. And the LW hospitality websites and try to get familiar with those.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:48:49.772Z)

Yeah. And again, Noble's the one that they're, like, going to be like if we get them as a client.

### You (2025-08-04T14:48:53.932Z)

Will be like.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:48:54.492Z)

We'll be like.

### You (2025-08-04T14:48:59.292Z)

Although they are circles, that platform.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:48:59.772Z)

Although they are starting a debt platform.

### You (2025-08-04T14:49:01.212Z)

So that might be the place where you say, okay.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:49:01.852Z)

So that might be the place where you say, okay. You're going to need to under. You're going to need to pick up your pace. On underwriting. And so this might be the window into them.

### You (2025-08-04T14:49:11.372Z)

This might be.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:49:14.812Z)

Is through their debt. Platform.

### You (2025-08-04T14:49:16.412Z)

That's a good point. Too. I need to kind of switch direction mentally because, like I said, I'm really excited about the marketplace. With brokers and investors. And my point of view. Has always come from the underwriting and investment side. Equity. So I need to. We really kind of take a look at the roadmap. And see if there is anything. On the roadmap. That's really investor. Equity focus that maybe we can swap out with some debt focus. I do agree. Now that we've had some of these conversations, I really think that that would be a good way to get our foot in the door. And get our first clients and testimonials. And some users.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:50:06.572Z)

30%. 30% of hotel loans are going to come due the next year. That's a lot. That's like, yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:50:14.172Z)

It's an amazing market.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:50:17.852Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T14:50:19.692Z)

All right. So yeah. I'm going to spend some time getting educated on the debt side of the industry and see if there's anything else we can focus on there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:50:33.212Z)

Okay? All right. Then. Very good. And will you look, or should we just type into teams?

### You (2025-08-04T14:50:40.252Z)

And connect with.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:50:40.812Z)

And connect with Vinod about finding a time to for the three of us to connect on AI development and budget.

### You (2025-08-04T14:50:46.812Z)

It'll probably be a 5:30 call for him. But yeah. Let me get with him and find out. If he's got any availability. It's not urgent. It doesn't have to be done in the next.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:51:03.372Z)

Weak, right?

### You (2025-08-04T14:51:04.412Z)

But, yeah, I don't remember. I think it's Friday. When he's fairly consistently at home. He said that when they first started, it was supposed to be four days in the office. But he says it's not consistent. Sometimes it's three. He said even there's been a week where they were only there two days. So let me see if he's got some availability at a more reasonable time. Than 5:30 and we'll see. I'll go ahead and take care of that. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:51:33.132Z)

Okay? And I'm good at 5:30 any day. So yes. Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T14:51:37.772Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:51:38.092Z)

All right. Howard. Then we'll Talk tomorrow at 5:30.

### You (2025-08-04T14:51:40.892Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T14:51:42.332Z)

Okay? Bye.

### You (2025-08-04T14:51:42.732Z)

All right, see you.
