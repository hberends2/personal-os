# Transcript for: Career journey and product management insights interview

### You (2025-10-07T19:01:42.667Z)

Hey. Good afternoon. Tomorrow, how are you?

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:01:45.140Z)

So, Howard, good afternoon.

### You (2025-10-07T19:01:48.187Z)

I'm doing pretty well, thank you.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:01:51.300Z)

Well about yourself. Thanks for your interest in measurable. Introduction about myself. I joined Measurable every five months ago.

### You (2025-10-07T19:02:02.747Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:02:08.340Z)

Before that I was cto at one hour. And before that, I was at Amazon for 12 years. So I've been in software development for a long time. Interested in technology. Building a more sustainable planet. So that's why I came to Measurable and Sunflower as well.

### You (2025-10-07T19:02:31.627Z)

Very good. Okay? Yeah, be happy to do so. Let me see. I'm trying to shut down some items on my screen because I tend to freeze up on video here. So if I've got a three monitor set up. So if I'm looking all over the place. Excuse me there, but yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:02:38.500Z)

Give me introduction to yourself.

### You (2025-10-07T19:02:54.987Z)

I've actually been in the commercial real estate space for. 30 years. For quite some time, my entire career. And started off in the property operations side. And eventually, after about six years or so, when we moved to Dallas, Became involved with asset management, which was more in line with my background and my degree in finance and economics. So while I was in the asset management field, I was with quite a few of the larger organizations out there, including Vice President of Asset Management at BH Management Services. And this was back 2001, 2002, when Texas was. Grandfathering anybody who was in on a utility management billing program with some changes in their laws. So my directive was to implement a utility management program. And at the time, there were quite a few properties that were billing utilities, but none of them that went into the full utility management space. So at the time, I was the largest portfolio. In the country. To implement that. So I've been very involved with. Utilities and energy management, that type of activity. Since 2001, 2002, and then around 2005, I was given an opportunity to join RealPage. With my degree in finance and economics. I was also very strong with financial reporting. And reporting in general. And So I joined RealPage. This was my first stint as a product manager. And we created what was named at the time Real Page Central Reporting. And if you're familiar with RealPage, you already know that their business model is growth through acquisition. They don't really start any product from scratch. They'll buy and integrate. So it was a very siloed organization. When they acquired a company, that company continued to operate pretty much as they were before, but just a different logo on their screen. So we had to take all of this data from disparate data sources create a data warehouse. But I got bit by the technology bug at that time. So ever since, I've been pretty much on the product management side. And in 2011, I joined aum, which is american utility management, as their director of business intelligence. And I have been on the tech side in product management and business intelligence type of products ever since.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:06:23.780Z)

That's good. Thank you. I'm going to ask you about eight or nine questions, approximately three to four minutes per question.

### You (2025-10-07T19:06:28.507Z)

Okay? Sure.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:06:34.340Z)

So use your time accordingly. First question. Describe a product or service that you created. That gave you a lot of satisfaction. What did the product do? And why was it so fulfilling for you?

### You (2025-10-07T19:06:46.107Z)

Yeah, that's an easy one. So my last position before the downsizing was the Senior Director of Product Management at rediq. Rediqiq is. A multifamily investment, underwriting and valuation platform. And they have been around since around 2017. But. The only product and service they provided was ingesting documents like financial statements, rent rolls, parsing the data. Putting it out into a database, and then the users will use that data to perform their underwriting. When the property is bought. Or taken off the market, they're done until the next deal comes along. So it had a very limited lifecycle. So shortly after joining, I realized that. Pretty much all the data that they were already extrapolating was useful throughout the entire lifecycle of the product, the apartment community, the investment. It doesn't necessarily have to stop. And so I developed and led the development of what we called the lifecycle management system, which was basically a suite of products that users could use all the time that they owned the deal. And so for asset management budgeting pro forma, we implemented demographic data was brought in. I mean, just a lot of different products. Worked very closely with the data science team on creating location data. And so we built out zero to one platform where we tagged onto the end of that acquisition cycle. Went all the way through until the point where basically it could be 3, 5, 10 years until they sell the product. So I think that was one of them that I looked back on. Very fondly.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:09:02.340Z)

And what was the value that your customers were able to realize through the product you built?

### You (2025-10-07T19:09:05.947Z)

Having a single platform where they can upload their data, continue to extract data from financials and do comparisons. One of the products that we built was it was basically started off as a budgeting tool, but we ended up calling it the pro forma versus actual, which allowed them to forecast using our tool just like they would if they're acquiring a property they want to forecast out. But we would create. They had the ability to create up to three different pro formas so they could do what if scenarios, buy, sell, analysis, all sorts of different things that they couldn't do with a typical financial program that they use. So the really bottom line comes down to is it was really popular with the owners and the asset managers where they may have properties that are managed by multiple management companies. And one could be using one site, another one could be on Yardi. But because of the way that we extract the data, And combine it into a single mapped resource. They could take all of that data. Upload it themselves and take a look at the deals all across their portfolio, regardless of the source of the data, who's managing it, etc.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:10:40.260Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-07T19:10:41.947Z)

It is. It is. So rediqiq was previously owned by Berkadia. Berkadia is the largest brokerage and loan servicing organization for multi family.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:10:42.580Z)

So Rediq. Is that so around? What's the startup of the company?

### You (2025-10-07T19:10:57.067Z)

They acquired RedIQ primarily for their own brokers to use to create the valuations for the properties that they're listing. But rediqiq also had jll, cbre Wakeman, just all sorts of competitors to Berkadia, and they continued to use the tool even after Berkadia owned them. So had a huge base in the commercial real estate brokerage. But what happened is Berkadia had multiple contracts for third party data. And I needed that data from my lifecycle management suite. I wanted to be able for our users to be able to take a look at that performance. That we spent all that time being able to consolidate that data. However, Rediq was contractually prohibited from getting that data from Berkadia because it kind of put us in the position of being a reseller. So when Radix bought RediqIQ a year ago in August, we thought that was going to be the ultimate combination. Because they are a third party data provider, we would no longer be hamstrung by those contracts. But at the time, Radix's product was collateral damage for the real page. Class action loss. And they were hemorrhaging clients and their core product was not doing well. So long story short, they took all of my devs, all of my customer service clients, all the engineers, except for two that were left basically to keep the lights on at RedIQ so that they could help the Radix core team pivot. And what they ended up doing is basically everybody else was let go. It was downsized. So myself, along with eight other engineers, all but one of the client service team. A couple of the sales team members were left, but basically they weren't able to support both tools. So it was a match made in Hepburn, but it was the wrong timing.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:13:29.380Z)

All right. My next question. What are the top three qualities? In your opinion, for a successful product manager. Can you give me an example?

### You (2025-10-07T19:13:40.107Z)

Yeah. Curiosity, obviously. Number one, in my opinion, because you need to be able to.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:13:40.820Z)

Of where you demonstrated those three qualities.

### You (2025-10-07T19:13:48.987Z)

Really dig around and learn. What are the clients using? What are their needs? What other industries are advancing or having success in product that might be adaptable to what you're doing. Excuse me. Obviously patience is another one.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:14:16.500Z)

Can you give me?

### You (2025-10-07T19:14:17.387Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:14:19.460Z)

Give me an example for curiosity.

### You (2025-10-07T19:14:20.427Z)

One of the things, especially the last couple years with the AI coming around and making it very easy to prototype and do all sorts of things. So I have been very Busy, both with RedIQ and then since just on my own and working with another company right now. Building out a proof of concept and just learning things about coding databases that I didn't know in the past. Applying a lot of what I've done in the past into these tools. The proof of concepts. So that's one area of curiosity that's really benefited me. But one of the things on a personal note is one of the reasons why I really gravitated to the tech side is because I've got adhd. And when I was with in the property management and asset management field, when people ask me what I did for a living, I would say I sit around and watch the paint dry on walls, literally. Because when you buy a property and you renovate it, that before and after is great, but it takes years before you get to that after. And so technology in general. It changes so fast and it keeps me going. I love it. And just the ability to keep trying. New features, new products. I can do things now with the team of three that used to take a team of 15 right before. So that's probably where I've been spending the majority of my time. In terms of curiosity. Doing that. I think patience. Patience is definitely necessary in this field because you can't just jump on a feature.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:16:12.580Z)

Curiosity was one. What were the other two?

### You (2025-10-07T19:16:22.587Z)

Or a product because it sounds good. Or maybe because it happens to be your largest client, you have to be able to take the time. To make sure that you're doing what's best that aligns with the business needs. For the company you work for as well as the business needs of the clients. And to avoid that shiny object syndrome. But you have to balance that. You can't just drag your feet and just drag on while you're trying to learn these things. So obviously, the curiosity in the patients can work together and they can sometimes conflict. But I do think being patient. Is pretty necessary. The other one is just being a learner. And being willing to talk to people and consider ideas that you may not be familiar with. I line. I had to deal with that one early in my career because, like I said, I've been in commercial real estate my entire career. Works my way up very high in the corporate ladder is VP of Asset Management. And my early roles as a product manager were actually more subject matter experts. And so I kind of felt like, you know, all I gotta do is get these people to do it the way I do it, because I'm an expert in multifamily, right? And so after a while, I. Especially when it started meeting with clients and there were companies I've never heard of. And I learned that they were exceptional property managers and owners, and they were doing way better. Than the corporate REITs and all of the companies that you hear about in the news. And so, you know, that was an eye opening experience. Realizing that bigger doesn't necessarily mean you're a better operator. And to be curious and to learn what these other companies are doing and how you can adapt that.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:18:45.060Z)

Tell me more about that. What did you learn from. The better. Operating property managers versus Global or log.

### You (2025-10-07T19:18:52.907Z)

They had to do more with less. A lot of times, obviously, the Gray Stars and the Camdens and they have deep pockets. They can go out, raise money.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:18:57.060Z)

Ical.

### You (2025-10-07T19:19:07.147Z)

And they operate. For the ffo. Whereas the smaller companies, they have to be able to compete with that and run the tighter ship. So, you know, I found a lot of companies out there. That they don't do that well. But the ones that I did find. They just really were more efficient. They were actually doing a lot of things that the big companies weren't doing. That were really contributing to the bottom line. And so, you know, as I started meeting with these companies, And learning more about what they're doing. You know, I realized, you know, you have to be adaptable. You have to be versatile. You have to be creative to look outside the box.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:20:02.980Z)

Can you give me an.

### You (2025-10-07T19:20:04.347Z)

Yeah. Yeah, there's a. There's a company in New York that I worked with closely when I was with Aum, and their properties are all along the Eastern seaboard.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:20:05.140Z)

Example of a specific thing they were doing that bigger companies wouldn't do it.

### You (2025-10-07T19:20:16.667Z)

And many of them were down in the Carolinas, Virginia, areas that would get hit by a hurricane. And so they, they had a lot of. Maintenance and repair work that a lot of companies didn't have to deal with, that are primarily based in the Midwest or the west, that were also my clients. And they had set up a program where basically, in about three or four major cities, they would rent some. Some storage facilities and they would keep appliances, all the major items that they need for repairs. When they had these storms, and they would always be able to get their properties up and running. In a fraction of the time that everybody else was because they had the distribution mapped out. They had a small inventory. I mean, it wasn't sucking a lot of money by having to sit around. They were. They were using it on a regular basis and just that was. That was a real head scratcher for me. It's like I had never heard of anybody that were doing that, but, you know, I got pretty close with, with the company there, and they were sharing some of the cost savings they've had. They can, they can command higher rents than a lot of the other ones. They, they've got a fantastic reputation, so. Yeah. Yeah, nice. Sorry.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:21:48.820Z)

Howard. You got to watch the time and keep your responses succinct.

### You (2025-10-07T19:21:51.867Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:21:53.380Z)

And otherwise we won't get through all the questions I have. Next question. How does products strategy differ from business strategy?

### You (2025-10-07T19:22:00.507Z)

I don't think it does.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:22:02.500Z)

Is it useful to make the distinction, and if so, why?

### You (2025-10-07T19:22:03.307Z)

Product strategy is a way to carry out the business strategy. Obviously the product team. You know, I. I don't have all the answers. That's. That's one thing I know. As a product manager, it's not my job to have all the answers. It's my job to know where to get those answers. So if there is an opportunity to look into adjacent products, features, different things. Like I mentioned the Life Cycle suite that I put together. That's great, as long as it's aligned with the business interest and that you're not going out. So, you know, I do feel that the business interest drives the product.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:22:54.820Z)

Can you describe an innovative product? That you created from interception to launch.

### You (2025-10-07T19:23:02.747Z)

I think I would probably still fall back on that Life cycle management suite. That was a zero to one. That was a huge challenge because it was something that nobody else in the organization had experience with. So I had to coordinate the entire.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:23:02.980Z)

What challenges did you face?

### You (2025-10-07T19:23:20.907Z)

Product basically from 0 to 1. It was innovative because there wasn't anything else out there like it. There are asset management tools, but that differs because those tools are geared towards the owners, investment funds, VCs, where they're looking. It's almost like an accounting program on steroids. Whereas when I put together is for the operators and the smaller teams to go at the individual asset level. So we had no competition on that. And again, I. It's not the only one that I've done zero to one, but that's the one that I'm most proud of.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:24:09.620Z)

Okay? If you had to pick another one, which one would that be?

### You (2025-10-07T19:24:11.707Z)

Back when I was working with Conservus around 2001. I was working with Chris Loffman, who's now with Graystar. He was at Conservus, and this was shortly, you know, a couple years after the Paris Accord. But I worked with him on putting together some new products for ESG and primarily sustainability. Putting together some dashboards. We were about to release it under the. We were going to call it Comparison. You know, Conservus always has the products start with Steel Inn. So we went with Comparison. We were about to release that. Unfortunately, I can't sit here and say how well it was run because I ended up. Getting poached by rediq. Chris went to Graystar, so I can't really sit here and say, yeah, that was an extremely successful but I know it was after the fact with my contacts that conservatives that it went over pretty well in terms of being able to compare the user's reductions in their carbon footprint and their sustainability initiatives. Comparing their score to the goal for the Paris Initiative for 2025, 2030, 35, etc. So I thought that was pretty innovative. Product that we were able to put together. So. That's a good question. I think the only one that was anywhere near what I would call a failure was that original project with RealPage, where we built the first consolidated data warehouse. And the reason it was a failure. Is that at the time, RealPage did not have their own accounting system. They were licensed using intact accounting. Where they thought they were going to be able to get that data. From intact. They were never able to do so. So it wasn't something that I had any. Influence over in terms of the negotiations with intact. But the product withered on the vine simply because we had all of this operational data. From beginning of the leasing journey all the way through operations, but we couldn't match that data. To the financial data. So, you know, I could tell you about your traffic, your leasing. All of this information, but I couldn't break it down into what is your cost per lease? What is your cost per traffic? All these different financial KPIs we just couldn't do. So they eventually did get their data from intact, but that wasn't until around 2010, and I had been gone for about two years at that point.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:27:50.980Z)

Challenging status goal can be difficult. Describe a situation where, again, any beliefs and standard thinking.

### You (2025-10-07T19:28:00.027Z)

Yeah, that's a good one. Most recently it was with Rediq and Berkadia. So Berkadia.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:28:00.820Z)

To create significant change.

### You (2025-10-07T19:28:10.747Z)

Was considered themselves to be an agile, but they were more safe agile and very stuck on the SDLC process. Everything was linear. Product manager puts together the requirements. Hansel's requirements over to the architect. The architect puts together his information, then goes to the design. Design does their thing. So it was a very structured linear product. And I pushed back on that because it wasn't benefiting rediq, nor was it benefiting the rest of the organization. But Berkadia did have a very large product team for their in house products. Rediq was the only external client. So it was a little bit difficult because a lot of people on the Berkadia side were used to it. It was that this is the way we've always done it type of argument. But I was able to make change. And it wasn't just for Rediq. What we ended up doing is we evolved into what we called the Four Horsemen. Which was getting product engineering, architecture and design. Altogether at step one. And not get rid of and not do that linear. We were able to get everybody together on board. And we were able to shorten up that development cycle by months by simply making that change. But it was interesting. There was no arguing, there was no fighting. I work very well with the team, and we were able to basically just. Look at each other. Fairly and with an open mind. And be able to work out the differences, and it turned out to be very good for both sides.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:30:20.500Z)

What are your go to data analytics techniques when you need to drive derive insight from a large data set.

### You (2025-10-07T19:30:28.107Z)

Yeah, I use power bi a lot.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:30:29.300Z)

Maybe you could illustrate with an example.

### You (2025-10-07T19:30:32.107Z)

Now. I am not a database engineer. So I rely very heavily on teaming up with somebody who is a data architect to be able to give me the data that I need. But of course, some of these AI tools out there. Are extremely helpful. For data analysis, etc. I can make Excel sing and dance and do whatever you need to do. So. Really? It's knowing who to go to. As much as what you do with the data once you get it again. I worked very closely with the data science team. At Berkadia as well as Radix to get to collaborate on some of the more difficult types of analysis. But. Yeah, I mean, that's a difficult question to answer, but as Director of Business Intelligence, I mean, I can go in there and I can analyze and I can separate the vanity metrics from the real metrics that drive innovation and revenue. So that's probably where I would say when it comes to analytics, one of my best skills is to be able to differentiate between the two and know which data really tells the story of what needs to be done. You know, finding that needle in the haystack is very important.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:32:13.140Z)

Tell me what about? You said so. Vanity metric sources.

### You (2025-10-07T19:32:14.267Z)

The metrics that drive business drive revenue.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:32:17.860Z)

What was other one?

### You (2025-10-07T19:32:23.547Z)

The vanity metrics are what I consider to be some of the internal metrics. I'm not saying they're not important, but to determine. How many documents did you process? How many? It really comes down to more of like a volume type of metric. How many customers, how many this, how many that, you know, it's good to know how many paying customers I have. You know, that's very important. But does that widget on a dashboard tell me what I need to do to get more.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:32:25.220Z)

How would you differentiate the two?

### You (2025-10-07T19:33:00.267Z)

It doesn't. It just, you know, it's. It's like looking in the rear view mirror is really what I would say is the vanity metrics. Versus the ones that drive business is to identify, you know, why are we either gaining or losing clients. What are some of the predictive measures that you can look at rather than, you know, looking at historical data? You really need to differentiate between what data tells a story. And how that can be applied towards either new products, increasing revenue, increasing clients, decreasing expenses, etc.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:33:55.940Z)

So you've been in real estate for a while? What are some inefficiencies you have observed in real estate or activities surrounding real estate? What are your ideas? To improve and deliver value to real estate companies.

### You (2025-10-07T19:34:09.067Z)

One of the things with real estate is. Slow to adopt technology. And I would say one of the benefits of the pandemic was that it forced them to look at technology that they just didn't use in the past. Revenue management. There's, you know, the self service leasing and a lot of the stuff that they do, smart apartments, etc. That that kind of forced the, the industry's hand, but they still resist, and they still. It takes a lot of time to get them to look at the changes. Now, certain asset classes of real estate aren't necessarily that way. You know, with the commercial buildings, office buildings, they tend to adapt technology much sooner. Depending on, on what it is. You know, the smart technology was, was very helpful there, but there's, there's just a lot of inefficiencies around. Might sound corny to bring up sustainability in esg, but, you know, I think that's one of the things where there's a lot of opportunity to work on there. Particularly with different asset classes. But I think, to me, the inefficiencies really lie in the fact that the industry takes a long time to trust technology, whereas in other businesses, other markets, it's adopted very quickly.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:36:08.180Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-07T19:36:08.667Z)

Yeah, yeah. Slow to adopt technology.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:36:09.540Z)

So the inefficiency is what again? Adoption of technology. And so what are what?

### You (2025-10-07T19:36:20.747Z)

You have to identify who in the organization.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:36:21.780Z)

Are. What are your ideas to help fix that inefficiency?

### You (2025-10-07T19:36:25.307Z)

Is most affected by that. Certain technology, right? A lot of times, the C suite and senior management are too far removed from the people who are actually managing the asset that are at the asset every day. And they have the attitude like, we're doing fine right now. I don't see why we should spend this money. Right. So a lot of times you focus on the site staff, and if you can get them, To buy into the product. You can sell your way up the chain rather than starting at the top and down. And I think that's probably where a lot of the people, a lot of the organizations fail because they think they have to. You know, we got to convince the CEO that they need this. Well, the CEO probably has no idea. What they're going through at the site, and therefore, you get a lot of pushback, a lot of resistance.

Describe a situation where you had to manage a very difficult customer. What did you do and what was the outcome?

### You (2025-10-07T19:37:48.907Z)

Yeah. We had a situation with Graystar when I was with RealPage. More recently when Throughpage Utility Management. And a lot of it was the representative from Graystar was. Inexperienced in what they were asking us to do. And this was directly related to sustainability. They had a custom sustainability dashboard. That they wanted us to build. And they literally had a hand drawn dashboard. That they gave us. And, you know, here's the things we want to measure. Many of the items, the data just didn't exist. I don't know where they came up with these KPIs and metrics. So there's a lot of back and forth. Where essentially I had to educate the people that I was working with, the team and the point of contact that we had. Not just say, you know, we can't do this, but to make it clear as to why, but then come up with a suitable alternative, which we were able to do for some of the metrics they were looking for. You know, we said, well, we can't do this because we don't have the data. But we do have the data to give you something similar, or even in many cases, it was better. So kind of goes back to that whole patience where, you know, sometimes you just have to let them talk, and you just have a very honest, open, candid conversation about what you can and cannot do. I had a situation again with Real Page. Where basically they took a proof of concept. And sold it to a company, a client. And. We could not deliver that. We. It was one of those situations where. And this was before the intact purchase. So we were promising basically that we would provide this financial report that they needed. When we knew it couldn't be done. And I was so livid and upset about that. I just found it immoral that the salespeople would do that. You know, I refuse to promise something that I can't deliver. And so that's kind of what guided me with these conversations with gracetar through that. Is that, you know, I wasn't going to promise them that. Yeah, I can make that dashboard and not. It's better to. Just be honest with what you cannot do and work through it. And I had similar conversations with clients. And, you know, everybody thinks, oh, they're not going to do that. They're not going to listen. They're just going to demand that. And it's like, no. Just have an honest conversation with them, Tell them why. You know, give them an alternative. Don't just say we can't do it. Say we can't do it this way, but we can do that and go from there.

All right. Great. So we have four minutes or so left for you to ask me questions.

### You (2025-10-07T19:41:10.347Z)

Yeah. So I know that you. You've been with Measurables since March. What has your experience been since you've been there? In terms of. The market. And I think what I'm kind of concerned about is more or less. The political atmosphere. With, you know, a lot of these sustainability ESG programs being defunded. And, you know, what is you what is your take on that since you joined measurable.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:41:50.980Z)

Yeah, well, I joined measurable knowing that the political environment wasn't very friendly to sustainability.

### You (2025-10-07T19:41:52.347Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:42:00.100Z)

And knew that going in. I think the administration. Has made it very clear that it considers ESG as politics, so that's unfortunate. But that's the climate we're in and we have to have. I think that's a problem that the whole real estate industry is facing.

### You (2025-10-07T19:42:23.387Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:42:32.260Z)

Is very real problem. Are being sidelined. So it's a struggle. The environment, definitely. Customers less attention to ESG than they were before. They're putting projects on hold. Ing investments in ESG on hold. We are seeing banks and financial institutions change their tune on requiring sustainability reporting. So there's definitely a backlash. And it's very consequential. So we are adapting to see how best to position ourselves. I don't think measurable was ever. Out there way on the extreme, talking about green driving, everything green or anything like that. But we are definitely. In the sustainability space. So we are figuring out our business model and our strategy to be more. Focused on cost reduction and delivering financial outcomes. Along with sustainability. So that's kind of the approach we are taking. That makes sense from my bottom line perspective anyways.

### You (2025-10-07T19:43:59.787Z)

And, yeah, I mean, that. That is the domestic, but I know you do have a pretty decent international footprint as well. Are you seeing an offset? Because I know a lot of the other countries are really pushing for the ESG and sustainability, so.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:44:22.980Z)

Yeah. US Is far on the right when it comes to sustainability, but Europe is also seeing some pushback. And not as much as the us. But I think if the trend continues, There will be some significant countries in Europe who are starting to move rightward and starting to question sustainability.

### You (2025-10-07T19:44:44.267Z)

Y. Eah, yeah. And one thing that I did want to find out is where does AI fit into both the organization in terms of what tools can or can't you use as a measurable employee, as well as how does it look in the roadmap and what types of measures are you looking at to utilize AI.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:45:26.020Z)

Yeah. We look at AI as something that we can leverage to deliver value internally as well as to our customers. So we are working on several programs to do that. We have rolled out AI in our. One example I can provide to extract build data. And we have had a lot of success. So we are working on building in house capabilities to do that. So we'll do more along those lines. To incorporate AI into our internal processes.

### You (2025-10-07T19:46:06.907Z)

Very good. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:46:07.300Z)

And also make our customers lives easier and faster.

### You (2025-10-07T19:46:12.427Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. I'm currently working basically on a consulting basis with a company that is very similar to rediq, but in a different asset class.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:46:16.340Z)

Technology and product strategy.

### You (2025-10-07T19:46:27.947Z)

And myself and the CTO that I'm working with have been doing a lot on data extraction from financial statements. And unlike utility bills, They're all formatted differently. So that's been a fun project to work on. They're similar, but enough of a difference that you can't just create a template and say, this goes here. Not that simple, but yeah. There's a lot of value in data extraction and analysis there. Well, good. I know, I know we're pushing up against time. We're probably have gone over a bit, but is there anything else that I can help with or any other questions?

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:47:18.100Z)

No, Those are my questions. It's nice talking to you, Howard, and connecting with you again.

### You (2025-10-07T19:47:18.347Z)

Yeah, likewise. Pleasure meeting you and Noel and the team and looking forward to the next step. Okay? All right. Thank you. Bye.

### Guest (2025-10-07T19:47:33.300Z)

Great. Thank you, Howard.
