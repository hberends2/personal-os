It's gonna come. Yeah. I can see it now.

### You (2025-06-30T22:04:30.454Z)

Okay. So what I have done, the the biggest things now is up here, the market data. This is a new section

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:04:42.075Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:04:43.924Z)

Right. And I worked with Drew on this. So it used to be called market

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:04:45.295Z)

Right. Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:04:50.634Z)

comps. Okay. But market comps now is a subcategory here. Okay. We so we have it there.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:04:58.505Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:05:00.304Z)

And and basically, this is the exact same thing that's always been there. The new items are

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:05:07.295Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:05:07.454Z)

operating statistics and transaction summary. And Drew sent me the template for these. These are 100 they're they're always going to be manual. This is when a user calls up somebody, you know, and and kinda gets

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:05:22.135Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:05:25.974Z)

the inside scoop and whatever they want to do. So, you know, these are the fields. He said that they always take a look at. So, you know, you can go up here and you can change property one to, you know, whatever

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:05:36.775Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:05:39.684Z)

You know, you can so so you can track it there. And then here, you can start putting in you know, information. And then this is, like, just telling you whether it's month to date, year to date, or fiscal year. So if it's a partial year, you can you know, kinda good go whatever. It doesn't do anything. It's just for the user. No. And, you available rooms if they have thirty five six seventy eight, and then you can put in the occupancy

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:06:05.355Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:06:10.524Z)

here. And when you do that, it

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:06:10.805Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:06:12.814Z)

will calculate the RevPAR. So there is one calculated item on here.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:06:13.195Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:06:17.224Z)

And then, you know, whatever the the ADR is. Can go there. You can have a free form notes field

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:06:23.775Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:06:26.404Z)

right now, it's only set up for two years, and I need to find out from Drew if that's enough. If not, we'll just have, a little plus sign down here, add another year. Same thing with the add a property. Right? So this is just your market comps. So these would be the hotels that I wanna track that weren't may maybe they're not in the star

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:06:48.125Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:06:51.444Z)

report, or they wanna do anything. Right? So you can just keep adding properties until you get all the ones you want in there. Transaction summary is very similar.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:07:00.715Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:07:02.534Z)

So this way of, you know, tracking other property sales. So, you know, if I'm buying the Hyatt and, you know, there's a a Ramada down the road and it sold in 2021. And they put in, you know, $1,000,234,567 in revenue amount that needs to be reformatted. This is incorrect. This is supposed to be a text. And not a dollar. So, you know, the renovated area might have been you know, the lobby. Or the pool, you know, put in there.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:07:36.235Z)

InnVestAI

### You (2025-06-30T22:07:38.364Z)

This would be the sale amount. You know? So big number there and then you put in the buyer name, seller name, you know, who was the lender here, And, again, more notes, free form notes. And then if there was another sale in the area, you just keep adding on here. So this is really, I think this is other than formatting some of it. You know? When I built it, it just made all these columns equal width. But you know, I wanna shrink these down to give the notes field more, but other than that, the the market data is pretty much ready to go. You know, this market comps, would be populated by the by the star report. So you can see it's got this star code and everything in in

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:08:27.605Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:08:28.264Z)

there. So not not nothing different there. On the valuation tab, this is this is new. There's nothing here. But this is where we'll put the acquisition the financing, and the disposition information And I will pull up my Excel here in a minute. After we get through this. Because I do have an Excel mock up for what these three tabs are gonna look like. So let's let's just go ahead and finish this.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:09:06.715Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:09:08.094Z)

Next. Oh, yeah. All the way. Okay. The proformatab then I did basically, what what I did on here is cleaning up a lot of the things that broke last time. Remember I told you, I think this this pro form a tab is pretty much maxed out and it's it's becoming anytime I make a change in one place, it changes elsewhere. But what I do have now is

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:09:35.225Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:09:38.904Z)

in the expense section, I showed last week, and this is still here. You know, you can choose how do you wanna forecast by POR, percentage of revenue, or manual input. I need to do the same for down here, the undistributed expenses you know, we'll need to have a drop down here to choose. Although I do need to get with it with the team because some of these may not use POR or you know, like the replacement reserve, I'll show you in a minute, is only percentage of revenue. There's no other way to forecast it. According to to to Drew and and Diane. So I'll I'll confirm with them. And if it's something other than those three options, you know, we can make a change there. And so now then we've got the gross operating profit calculation here. And then same thing below management fees. I know always percentage of revenue. So this will be just like the replacement reserve that I'll show you taxes and insurance, won't be percentage of revenue. It's either gonna be you know, per occupied room or a manual input. Right. And then so down here, then we have our total expense just like we have our total revenue up above.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:10:57.755Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:11:02.414Z)

And then we've got the, earnings before income tax, right here. And then below that, you've got your replacement reserve. And so, you know, this is what I was talking about Replacement reserve is always calculated on a percentage of your total revenue. So here, you can just input the number, but it's it's got a form this one's got a formatting issue as well. Instead of starting with the the left decimal, it starts with the right And every time you add something, it just goes over and over. So I do need to change the formatting. But if you look over here,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:11:36.705Z)

Okay. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:11:40.034Z)

you'll see that, you know, every time you input a number, it calculates. Right? So you know, it's always gonna be, like, 4.2% instead of 0.44, but it's it works. It's just a formatting in the input. And then that brings us down to the net operating income. And then down here, capital expenditures,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:11:58.525Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:12:00.864Z)

You know, maybe they need a new roof and maybe they're gonna do it the second year of ownership. And it's gonna be half million dollars. Right? Or half million dollars. Right? And then they could add something else here, you know, new pool.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:12:17.105Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:12:17.894Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That might be year one. Yeah. And so 90 Right. So you can keep going down here, and and it's not something CapEx is not something that's spread evenly over years You know, these are the major construction items and usually they'll they could be spread out over a couple years depending on when you do it. You know? I I might start a project in September that will end next May, and so, you know, spread it out over these two. And just like the other ones, you can keep adding additional CapEx items here by just clicking on that and then getting your total down here. So those are the biggest ones. And and right now, in terms of functionality, this is working exactly what we need to do. There's just those formatting and and the the other expense calculations that I need to add the drop down boxes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:13.535Z)

Yeah. I mean, this this looks amazing.

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:16.694Z)

And, Clint,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:18.445Z)

And sorry, I couldn't get back to the issue you had

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:18.884Z)

the point of door.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:21.645Z)

told me. I don't know whether that is resolved now or not. There's a issue last time we discussed.

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:24.574Z)

Discussed So that's some calculation. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:29.345Z)

Well, that's some calculation issue. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:31.384Z)

It was it was not calculating correctly.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:34.765Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:35.504Z)

And, like, the undistributed expenses were repeated two other times. They were here, and then down below the debt operating income. They were repeated down here again It's just I don't know how it got so screwed up. Something happened when I was doing something.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:13:55.015Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:13:55.094Z)

Reformatting, but so but now it's in the right format. We got the right sections in the right places. The math is adding up for the total and everything. So yeah. Just little things like, you know, getting this to the percentage input to work correctly. So Oh, I'm

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:14.035Z)

Well, I mean, this is all all awesome.

### You (2025-06-30T22:14:14.094Z)

yeah. So we're getting really close being able to sit down in front of some of those people and doing a demo.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:23.715Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:14:24.394Z)

It's not it would not to the point where they can actually log in and test it, but, you know, we can at least start showing. It's okay.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:33.025Z)

No. It's it's great. I'm in this this looks good. There are two things that is pending in my plate. One is Diane had asked me to add that

### You (2025-06-30T22:14:41.624Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:43.835Z)

bar. So I was kind of doing I mean, we are done here. Right? Or

### You (2025-06-30T22:14:49.174Z)

Yeah. Let me show you the one last thing.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:52.675Z)

wanna discuss

### You (2025-06-30T22:14:53.904Z)

Sure. Sure. I have to switch my screen here.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:14:53.975Z)

once? Yeah. Sure. Sure.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:03.254Z)

Alright. Okay. So let me know when you see my Excel model. Yeah. I can see it. Okay. So this is just the the the

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:12.735Z)

Yeah. I can see it.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:15.404Z)

the valuation tab that that I showed earlier that has three links. And it's gonna work very similar to the others.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:21.015Z)

Good night. Yeah. Bye.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:23.774Z)

So one of the things I thought about is

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:25.875Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:26.794Z)

all of these metric cards up here should be visible no matter what screen you're on. And with the exception of, like, the market data,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:33.555Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:36.134Z)

you know, things like that. But for the valuation and the pro form a, those two,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:40.405Z)

No.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:41.854Z)

we wanna have this up here all the time. Because every time we make a change, it could change these numbers

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:43.055Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:46.704Z)

here. Right. Right? So what I thought is a modal

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:51.125Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:15:52.264Z)

that can that can pop up or or actually, I'm sorry, not a modal. A page with three tabs. Yeah. Yeah. This top section here with the yellow inputs

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:15:59.655Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:02.844Z)

will change depending on what tab you're on.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:03.815Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:06.194Z)

And all of these down here below

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:08.255Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:09.004Z)

this will remain static. So these inputs here, are gonna control your purchase price in the in this information here.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:15.135Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:18.304Z)

Now this is optional. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:18.745Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:21.414Z)

Here because what I was thinking is

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:21.565Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:23.814Z)

this is a onetime input that will never change. You know, the whatever lender you're working with

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:29.255Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:32.414Z)

will say you need to set aside x percentage for reserve for replacement. So we could put it here, instead of that where I was showing, but but this this is optional. But these up here will drive these down here.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:44.495Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:48.314Z)

Yeah. And then when I'm done with that,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:50.615Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:51.074Z)

you know, I would go down to and go to my financing tab. And same thing. These control this.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:16:59.025Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:16:59.304Z)

And then, you know, so this is all of your assumptions

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:17:00.495Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:17:02.714Z)

for the loan and the financing as well as your hold period.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:17:04.935Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:17:06.784Z)

So if term will determine how many forecast columns we have

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:17:09.245Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:17:12.054Z)

in the in the pro form a. Right now, it's just a static

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:17:16.815Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:17:18.544Z)

five years for the proof of concept, but it could be three It could be ten. It could be anything in between. And so this is what's gonna drive the number of forecast columns that are visible. And then down here, you have to forecast your exit with a cap rate and then what you typically pay the broker for selling your property. And this is gonna come and calculate your excess exit assumptions And all of these are going to affect these tabs up here. You know, your IRR, you have know what you buy it for, and you have to know and you have to estimate what you can sell it for. ROI, same thing. Your cash on cash. These are all investment return metrics that you have to have these items in order to calculate. Does that make sense? Yeah. That's yeah. Yeah. So I will be working on this over the next

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:18.275Z)

Right. That does. Yep.

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:21.194Z)

few days, but I I want to get feedback from Drew and Diane to

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:21.815Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:25.744Z)

to make sure that I've got everything here. And since it's on a different tab than the pro form a

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:30.235Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:32.724Z)

think I can do it without breaking everything. So hopefully. But, yeah, that's what I've been working on for the last week.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:40.265Z)

Yeah. I mean, this all looks awesome. Awesome.

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:45.684Z)

Thanks. Paul. So that super obvious.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:48.855Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:49.004Z)

They have them.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:50.065Z)

Cool. So that super base thing, I'm kind of still

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:50.574Z)

Trying to set. With that. Hopefully this week, and we'll have

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:54.775Z)

trying to set up, but I'll I'll be done with that

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:57.144Z)

to five three. Their field name.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:18:58.635Z)

hopefully, this week, and we'll have the

### You (2025-06-30T22:18:59.294Z)

Classroom. Okay. Again,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:01.655Z)

I'll create test username and password then whoever wants to see it.

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:02.034Z)

Alright. So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:05.545Z)

Can

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:06.954Z)

I I also have this up. Let me make sure I'm

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:06.995Z)

do that. And then

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:11.984Z)

talking about the same thing. So are you talking about

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:15.445Z)

Shit.

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:18.674Z)

the InnVestAI teaser, or are you talking about the the model?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:20.185Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:24.824Z)

Understand. That's not a big thing that Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:28.185Z)

No website, I have to that's not a big thing. I was actually working on that. Sorry.

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:31.434Z)

It's nicer than Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:33.155Z)

I shared my screen. So I would yeah, I was actually working on that. Went to modify it, I see a different template altogether.

### You (2025-06-30T22:19:43.074Z)

Well, good. I don't feel so bad now.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:19:45.965Z)

What is it? This is not my template. Where? Yeah. Like, where is my tablet? I don't know what these guys are doing. So let's see. I mean, that putting that subtitle won't be difficult, but just

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:01.644Z)

Would like

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:02.095Z)

thought. I don't see my template here now. But I'll I'll see. So this can this can be done. And that's not a problem. The other thing, the application, right, where we

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:10.954Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So more

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:13.345Z)

embedded the model inside. That one is what I was talking about. So hosting that application somewhere,

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:20.284Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:22.445Z)

and then connecting that to database so that we can log in.

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:22.614Z)

So deal? Deals here? We don't.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:25.845Z)

So

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:26.564Z)

No. No. I don't I don't think we need to.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:28.855Z)

do we need that for POC or

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:30.324Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:30.845Z)

we don't?

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:31.404Z)

at at first, like I said, the the the very first people we talk

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:31.865Z)

No? Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:36.044Z)

to we would have to be doing demos. And, you know, show hey. What what do you think of this? Does it look good? Does it work?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:20:41.505Z)

Yeah. Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:20:45.084Z)

But then hopefully within a few weeks, at least two to three weeks, we could have something where then they can log in and actually start plugging numbers. So So in this moment, right, now, they can create their own property and put numbers and everything.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:01.955Z)

So in this model right now,

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:05.124Z)

Be good. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:05.935Z)

they can create their own property

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:06.074Z)

I did not

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:09.135Z)

put numbers and everything should be good. Right? But

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:09.644Z)

include any authentication. On it.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:15.095Z)

yeah, authentication is

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:15.744Z)

Yeah. It's actually

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:18.895Z)

Like, authentication, we can add that on the other app.

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:19.444Z)

in browser data. I didn't connect it to Supabase or anything.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:22.875Z)

And then

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:25.294Z)

But But

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:29.395Z)

You don't need to. But in your case, right, the data you have,

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:31.404Z)

Right. And when

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:33.545Z)

you don't have that on database either. It's browser. And whenever we access that URL, that data is still available there.

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:36.204Z)

So thank you. If they end already. That

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:40.705Z)

Alright? So same for any other client as

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:43.204Z)

Oh, I I know what you're saying.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:43.785Z)

well. If they enter any data, that will be available all the times. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:45.564Z)

No. The in the data that I input

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:48.045Z)

Them.

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:48.334Z)

does not it it it does it's not persistent. So when I go when I log out and go back in, it's all zeros again.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:52.255Z)

Mhmm. Oh, okay. Got it.

### You (2025-06-30T22:21:57.324Z)

And and the historical data is just hard input. It's

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:21:59.045Z)

Oh, got it. Got

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:01.214Z)

just static data. It's not connected to anything? Okay. Yeah. Okay. I I I can get it to the I can get it to be persistent, which

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:09.155Z)

Okay. Got you. Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:11.644Z)

I need to do anyway, you know, because we've got all of that area on the top of the screen.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:13.265Z)

So uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:17.254Z)

And it doesn't show what property you're in. So we I need to have something in the header that shows the deal name,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:21.635Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:23.244Z)

city and state, number of rooms, just some of the basic information that they can view on every screen. You know? So there's there's some basic things that just still need to be added to it. Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:40.735Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:41.014Z)

So I can I'll quickly add into that subtitle on that

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:43.505Z)

Well, well, okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:45.024Z)

entire head of

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:46.515Z)

So, yeah, I'll I'll quickly do that subtitle one then Diane had asked. And then the other part is

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:50.874Z)

number. This into the application of what other resources we

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:54.315Z)

converting this into

### You (2025-06-30T22:22:55.514Z)

need and I Right? As Danny was asking. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:22:58.665Z)

the application and what all resources we need and expenses. Right? The

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:00.904Z)

we're at the point now where we're gonna have to make a decision on the database and

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:02.465Z)

As Diane was asking for.

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:05.244Z)

how we're gonna do it. So So why we try to create

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:09.345Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:11.734Z)

this application and this, like, SaaS product. So what I would do have done

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:14.655Z)

So one is like just creating this application. This is like a SaaS product.

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:16.204Z)

like, creating that into application. So that we have to learn the amount. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:19.585Z)

So whatever you have done,

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:20.884Z)

Yes. But other than that, he's asking for twenty four months of

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:21.725Z)

creating that into application. So that we have clarity on, like,

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:27.264Z)

funding.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:27.365Z)

But other than that, she was asking for twenty four months of, you know, funding and all that.

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:28.394Z)

So what else you know, what other features would we add in We are adding to this application or determine

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:34.755Z)

So what else you know, what other features would we add in

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:38.084Z)

how much expenses that will incur then? Well, good good question.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:39.985Z)

we would be adding to this application or determine

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:42.544Z)

Let me let me share.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:23:43.555Z)

how much expenses that will incur. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:23:44.934Z)

We've got that Jira set up. The discovery page. So as soon as you see this, Let's Yep. Yeah. So this is the

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:06.745Z)

Let's see.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:07.034Z)

you know, I I've been adding anytime somebody makes a comment,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:09.405Z)

Yeah. I see now.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:10.384Z)

or anytime I think of something, these are all of the different things that we could add

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:15.535Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:16.504Z)

into the product at some point. Some of this, you know, SSO, don't need that on day one. That could be done a year from now. Mhmm. But I do need to get together. We need to have a team meeting

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:27.975Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:29.184Z)

where we can go back and start scoring these. And then use scoring to determine the road map. So you know, deal creation, valuation model, MVP, that's what I'm doing right now.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:37.845Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:42.004Z)

Yeah. You know, I added the upload for the photos. So, basically, these

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:24:45.605Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:24:46.914Z)

three are in. Process. But then we say, okay. Well, when do we wanna put some special asset management fever features? Or, you know, what are we gonna do for agent AI? What can we do? You know? So a lot of this stuff when I add them here, I'm thinking, like, a year or so down the road. Yeah. Do we ever wanna put international Do we wanna have currency conversion? Do any things like that?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:25:17.655Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:25:19.884Z)

So to answer your question, what are we going to be doing next?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:25:26.395Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:25:26.554Z)

I would say some of the items in the existing model will have to be a little bit more detailed. Yeah. You know, because we have that hierarchy

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:25:42.375Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:25:43.954Z)

of the categories, like, the other operated. You've got your food and beverage, But within food and beverage, you have two more layers below that. So I would imagine, you know, that's one of the things we would wanna do because everybody keeps saying in in these other operated areas, some people just budget at the very top level, and some people get into the weeds. And so that would be one of the things that we would do fairly quickly. But in terms of new features, this is where we're gonna probably we're gonna have to let Mark arm wrestle with with everybody else.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:26:20.205Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-30T22:26:24.574Z)

Because I know he he has some very specific ideas of what he would like to to add in there. But a lot of them are really kinda focused on the analyst. And and I think we need to really appeal to you know, some of the higher levels. So, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:26:44.435Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:26:47.084Z)

what what about, you know, AI driven deal summaries? Using agentic AI to do a really in-depth market summary and and things like that. You know, do we wanna look at that?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:26:59.125Z)

No. Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:01.054Z)

I think a marketplace like we were building at Red IQ I think that would be huge because the the broker can then take the responsibility. They would come in here, create the deal, share it with other investors, and the other investors would just have to make minor tweaks. They don't have to build it scratch. I just think that's a great selling point. Right? Go ahead. You know? And I mean, kind of simplify this budgeting process. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:34.945Z)

And, I mean,

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:35.234Z)

Yeah. Probably, we could budget just for what we have right now. So what

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:38.155Z)

kind of to simplify

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:39.854Z)

minimum we need. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:40.135Z)

this budgeting process. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:41.504Z)

Yeah. What minimum we need. Is

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:43.145Z)

We could budget just for what we have right now. So what

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:43.564Z)

the login. We already have decided on this to log.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:47.245Z)

minimum we need. Right? So what minimum we need is

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:47.294Z)

Right? Yeah. So see. I might not

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:50.835Z)

the login. We already have decided on SSO login. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:52.574Z)

epad. So first thing first is long. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:27:55.995Z)

So let's see. My notepad. So

### You (2025-06-30T22:27:56.044Z)

We to decide what data sources. Right? So one, we already have

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:00.835Z)

first thing first is log in. Right? So we need log in.

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:04.344Z)

what the API is.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:04.685Z)

Then we need to decide on data sources. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:07.614Z)

So order BIS it

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:10.145Z)

So one, we already have

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:10.584Z)

giving us the right now, I think,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:11.885Z)

hotel BIS

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:12.894Z)

through Excel, and then

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:13.775Z)

So hotel BIS

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:14.294Z)

we're based extract that into

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:17.265Z)

is giving us data right now, I think, through Excel and then

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:20.214Z)

our database. Right? So it's like,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:22.355Z)

basically extract that into

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:23.894Z)

we need is our database.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:26.615Z)

our database. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:26.984Z)

That would require for login as well.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:28.965Z)

So second thing,

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:29.744Z)

Then third thing

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:31.325Z)

we need is our database that would

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:33.664Z)

is to post our

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:35.015Z)

require for login as well.

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:36.434Z)

cohort.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:37.125Z)

Then third thing

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:37.454Z)

Somewhere. Yeah. And so that that can be either get

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:40.075Z)

we need is to host our

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:43.034Z)

that can be

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:44.095Z)

code base somewhere.

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:44.194Z)

Azure. Post.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:45.975Z)

Right? So that that can be either GitHub or that can be Azure

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:46.454Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:52.485Z)

repos.

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:52.854Z)

go both

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:53.795Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:54.984Z)

this application somewhere. So posting

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:28:58.335Z)

And then we need to

### You (2025-06-30T22:28:59.834Z)

service.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:00.975Z)

post this application somewhere.

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:02.774Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:05.065Z)

So hosting

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:06.154Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:07.265Z)

service

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:07.274Z)

thought the data data will have just won't reach. Stick. To more FPS right now.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:13.655Z)

so as far as the data data go, right, we just want to stick to what will be as right now.

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:20.464Z)

Platform directly or I don't know

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:22.155Z)

Down the line, we'll probably we would ideally like you to upload to our platform directly or I don't know what's

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:30.764Z)

PRX and they deal with their

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:31.175Z)

what way we want to go whether

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:32.574Z)

Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:34.385Z)

we want to extract that data, keep it in our database, and give it to hotel BI

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:35.984Z)

I had a one on one with Diane.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:38.485Z)

and they deal with it or

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:39.224Z)

Last week. I think it was on Thursday. And we were focused on what do we need to do to get this thing off the ground. And ready to go. So we talked about you know, the LLC. We talked about potential

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:29:58.375Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:29:58.944Z)

seed funding, things like that. And so then we started talking about the data. Because she made a comment about Drew And and and I was talking specifically about

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:30:10.405Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:30:14.734Z)

potential clients of InnVest that are not clients of HBIS. And how do we extract that data? How do we get it?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:30:24.725Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:30:26.604Z)

And so she started talking about, you know, well, it would go here and then it would go to InnVest and and, like, well but they're not or HPIS. And I'm like, well, no. I'm talking about clients that don't use Drew. How would we process the financial statements? It's like, we don't wanna have duplicate systems again. Right? So we talked about how, you know, how how critical Drew really is. In in this process so that even if we sign a

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:31:00.345Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:31:03.584Z)

client that doesn't use HPIS, we can still use HPIS to process the the documentation.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:31:09.735Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:31:10.264Z)

And so then that data comes back to InnVestAI.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:31:15.965Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-30T22:31:16.714Z)

And so then we talked about, well, what about the rest of the HPI data? How are we going to structure this so that you know, we've got this aggregated database of APIs plus InnVestAI, whatever we can get together, plus possibly Lark or some of these other data sources. So I think by the end of the conversation, what I really wanted to stress with her is we need Drew. And if if we can't use HBIS to process the financial statements, he's got everything all mapped out already and and and if we can't do that, I told her it's it's gonna set us back two or three months. If we have to re what Drew has that and that we can't afford to do that. So Right. So, yeah, I think, you you know, I'd this was just me going off the top of my head. If you've got other ideas, let me you know, let's let's talk about it. In the morning. But, you know, what what we would want to do ideally is that know, even an InnVest client they don't have to know that the data is going to HPI Right? So we would have to have an upload. Drag your financial statements here, upload them, then we would process it through HBIS, and then place the data in our database. Yeah. Gonna take a minute or two to do that just like Red IQ. Yeah. Probably not last, but we'll see how that works. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:32:53.765Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:32:54.514Z)

Process. It's we are

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:32:56.475Z)

But

### You (2025-06-30T22:32:57.764Z)

does not have the same

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:32:58.775Z)

The only block blocker in that process would be if HPIs does not receive data from any other

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:05.424Z)

data Yeah. Yeah. So there yeah. That that's why

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:33:08.235Z)

APIs. It's just their UI where they upload the financial

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:10.244Z)

know, I wanted to talk to you about it before it gets beyond anybody else because, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:33:13.105Z)

data.

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:15.214Z)

we've talked about HPIS and APIs and and everything else. Don't think don't get me wrong. I don't think there's any danger that Drew is not gonna come on board. He's been really helpful. He sent me a couple emails and everything. So, yeah, he wouldn't be putting this amount of effort into checking if you know, every time I post a video, he's the first one to reply.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:33:36.235Z)

Yeah. Super. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:39.504Z)

He's always right on it. So yeah. The the question is, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:33:45.275Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:46.044Z)

are there going to be any contractual issues? Are we gonna have to merge into a

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:33:48.805Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:33:51.014Z)

single business? Are we how are we gonna handle the the not just the technical part, but you know, just the legal. So Okay. Okay. Just think put dependency on HBI.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:04.785Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:05.844Z)

Tool. Right? Then we are creating. One is to get the data. Another one is to extract

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:09.545Z)

And there's this deep dependency on HBIS.

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:12.364Z)

data. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:13.525Z)

Too, right, that we are creating

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:14.004Z)

So that here. Is gonna be healthy.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:16.305Z)

One is to get the data. Other one is to extract data. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:19.374Z)

Three attempts at some point of time if it is not

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:21.295Z)

So dependency, I don't know whether it's gonna be healthy down the line. We'll basically have

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:22.904Z)

pages for one company or one Jira. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:26.965Z)

break that at some point of time if it is not gonna be

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:29.354Z)

get my right? Unless at least.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:30.855Z)

one company or one unit. Right? But to start with, I think we are fine. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:34.434Z)

Processing that files. Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned that to her too. It's like, okay. Well, what if we do partner

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:38.015Z)

Unless HBS suddenly stops giving us data or processing our files.

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:41.234Z)

and then somehow that partnership comes to an end? That's why I told you, you know, number one, we have to have that data in our database. So if he does split off, we we you know, it's like

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:53.835Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:56.894Z)

he takes the data with us. We're dead in the water.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:34:58.675Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-30T22:34:59.364Z)

So I was just trying to plant some seeds that she has to con into consideration when she has these conversations with Drew. She didn't really give me and I didn't really ask much. You know, what is the What's going on with Drew? I I just don't think anything's really changed. And she she she told me before that she thinks that he just wants to

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:35:25.525Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:35:27.434Z)

see how InnVest takes off. Before making a final decision. And I think he's seeing now with the valuation model that we're serious. And, you know, this is this is gonna happen. And this is the benefit. So I'm sure he'll he'll stay with us. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Yeah. So let's go. Back. To cleaning and budgeting for infrastructure. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:35:57.045Z)

Right. Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:35:58.014Z)

So from whatever we have, right,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:35:59.075Z)

Cool. Cool. Yeah. So let's go back to the budgeting for

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:00.694Z)

now, so I just doing it.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:04.045Z)

Right? So from whatever we have right now, so at least we need

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:09.944Z)

All these. Services

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:11.965Z)

these many few things

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:12.904Z)

So right now, I'm not even talking about

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:14.815Z)

right, wherein

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:16.424Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:16.585Z)

we'll have to pay for these

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:16.914Z)

creating type.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:19.385Z)

services. So

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:20.044Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:21.225Z)

right now, I'm not even talking about, you know, creating our own data warehouse or you know, anything related to having our own ML or

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:33.214Z)

know, AI services in place. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:35.475Z)

having our

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:36.124Z)

You can probably we we have

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:37.745Z)

any of the

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:39.134Z)

clarity on what we all know that.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:40.765Z)

you know, AI services in place. We can probably because we don't have clarity on what all we want on that front. Right?

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:48.214Z)

Yeah. I'm already.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:50.405Z)

For now, at least we know that we need this much

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:56.394Z)

Just saying that this is

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:57.535Z)

I don't know whether you can really

### You (2025-06-30T22:36:57.944Z)

what exactly are. Do.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:36:59.635Z)

I mean, unless we sit and kind of just say, you know, this is what exactly we're gonna do

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:07.544Z)

We know know.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:09.685Z)

How do we budget for

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:11.024Z)

Yeah. I I think we just have to tell them.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:13.445Z)

technical things? We know we need database. We know we, you know, we

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:14.724Z)

I I you know, I none of them you know, Drew's got the technical background. Diane and Mark,

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:17.215Z)

we need these many things. But apart from that, yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:21.014Z)

they don't know. So I think we just have to put together a list of what we need and and, you know, a rough timeline. You know?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:30.195Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:30.544Z)

We don't need everything on day one. You know, but, you know, like Pendo or there was another one that we found that was

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:36.485Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:37.714Z)

like Pendo. You know? We need that. Or Heap. Yeah. Heap was the other one. So I just put the link to the tools for you. I don't know if you've

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:37:46.705Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:37:49.964Z)

been using the same one or not. But but, yeah, if we can just whatever you have you wanna add to this, You know, I think we do have We've got, like, the website email that's already been

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:05.965Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:07.634Z)

taken care of. We do need to have the database and all the associated expenses that you just went through. That.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:26.695Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:27.494Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:28.405Z)

And, yeah, probably then we can, you know, budget for

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:32.784Z)

Data.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:32.805Z)

that right now.

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:33.854Z)

What will be

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:34.095Z)

Whatever we want to do with AI or data, we can

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:37.674Z)

that they can put it up.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:38.515Z)

So right now, we can just say, you know, we we are getting data

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:39.924Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:42.755Z)

hotel BIS. And we just, you know, kind of extract that data and put it in on our database. So all we need is is a database and then, you know,

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:48.124Z)

I can put together x expenses for that. Krishna. Yet.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:52.525Z)

application hosting services.

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:52.984Z)

You know, what are more features we want?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:55.395Z)

Yeah. I can

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:57.324Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:38:57.815Z)

put together expenses for that to start with.

### You (2025-06-30T22:38:58.384Z)

Alright. Cool.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:39:01.825Z)

Then whatever more features we want to add, we can probably budget for that.

### You (2025-06-30T22:39:04.174Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Let's just go ahead and, you know, throw everything on here that you can possibly think of, actually. And then we can just decide what we need and when we need it. And go from there. And things like that, the the AWS and that stuff, I have no idea what they cost. So Okay. I'm sure you'd be able to put together some type of an estimate I I yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:39:32.075Z)

Alright. I will. I will. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:39:40.814Z)

Confirm or I was so serious, but I don't think we need to do that right now.

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:39:47.145Z)

I don't know whether you had chance to

talk about having more resources, but I don't think we need to do that right now.

### You (2025-06-30T22:39:53.254Z)

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:39:56.185Z)

Unless we get any funding or unless, you know, we

### You (2025-06-30T22:39:59.034Z)

you know, we we we did say that yeah. I mean, yeah, we are

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:40:02.155Z)

let

### You (2025-06-30T22:40:02.174Z)

going to get to the point where you know especially if you are in a contract or still working with somebody, we're gonna have to get it least another junior developer. Yeah. But there's also things too. I mean, who's gonna sell it? And who are doing the onboarding?

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:40:21.325Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:40:22.514Z)

onboarding videos. So, you know, we don't use it like that on day one. But you know, there's there's other you know, we talked about the fact that we we are absolutely gonna have legal fees now to get all this stuff done. Possibly, Well, definitely, we're gonna need an accountant or somebody

### Guest (2025-06-30T22:40:55.705Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-30T22:40:58.464Z)

you know, because we talked about we have to have some type of a document that talks about profit or the the equity that each person has, how it's divided, and what can we do, and and you know, there are things we have to decide what type of equity plan it is, you know, employees. Is it gonna be an employee stock option, or is it gonna be distributions or what? Of that has to be documented and set up. So you know, I don't know who's gonna pay for that. Without having some type of funding. So
