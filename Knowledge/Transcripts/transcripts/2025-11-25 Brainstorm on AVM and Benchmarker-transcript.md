# Transcript for: Brainstorm on AVM and Benchmarker

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:01:12.289Z)

Hey, mark. Unmute day. Good morning. Good morning. Hello. How's it going? Good. Hey, jeremy. Hello. Thanks for taking the time to look forward to it. Yeah. Hey, just so you know, Jeremy's been in a real mood this week. So go. Well, I wasn't until just now. Let me tell you why, because maybe this is interesting to everyone. Co Star has changed the way that they export their data. So, you know, CoStar has taken over STR, so we all had to figure out how to incorporate that into our models. As of today. I don't know when, but me checking this morning, their export data structure is now different. So the new models we just built to use Co Star's export don't work. Right now until we.

### You (2025-11-25T16:02:06.130Z)

All they can do is take averages of whatever publicly available data is. And so, okay, yeah, if you want an average valuation on an average property and figure out what the average price is going to be, go ahead. That's the best. You're not going to win the deal that way.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:02:06.609Z)

Maybe that's a segue into the conversation. But that very, very stressful. And obviously, Jeremy, that was with no notice. Right? No. No, he didn't tell anybody. I don't know when it happened. We're still trying to figure out what actually changed. Do we have the flexibility to change it back? I don't know, but oh my goodness. Do you guys like deliverables for clients and things like that that are. I'm sure someone in our organization is about to figure that out under a more stressful.

### You (2025-11-25T16:02:24.690Z)

So we are looking at this is the valuation model, is a way to get our foot in the door. It's not the be all, end all. Of what we do. There are many, many other things that we can do. But even in our earliest version, in our proof of concept, we do have AI in there, so that.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:02:37.649Z)

Situation, but that's what I'm troubleshooting this morning. Is changed. I'm sorry, Jeremy. But, Diane, it's. When stuff like this happens, it's very helpful that Jeremy doesn't mind working 24 7. It's a good point. Yep. That's good. You're the one with the toothpicks in your eyes, right? Well, I know as Mark is very lucky to have you, Jeremy, because I have someone who's good, who understands hotels and also understands technology. And on the data side, it's very rare. So you're. I mean, I'm sure you're, again, really lucky to have you. There's lots. Well, and he does like his elders. So that's helpful. Oh, okay.

### You (2025-11-25T16:02:49.410Z)

When first off, we do utilize AI machine learning for the document processing. That's one thing you talked about before is. Each financial statement, you're going to have minor differences, right? It's a line item going to say food and beverage. Is it going to be eff and b? Is it going to be? What? Right. So there's always variations and therefore the fun learning comes in. It's going to say, oh, this abbreviation is this. Or you can tell you just constantly after thousands and thousands of operating statements, you get a really good mapping. So mapping the data is really not that difficult.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:03:22.289Z)

So I sent you guys some talking points, and we'll go through it in the next hour. If this is an intent, I don't want to dominate. I want this to be a conversation and not. But if I could just start with a couple of things that are kind of high level, and that is the first. Thing that since I've been doing this with InnVestAI and I've been really kind of almost becoming a technology person myself, right? I'm a real estate investor. I am a practitioner.

### You (2025-11-25T16:03:31.890Z)

I've said all along, it's all about the data. Right. Can I fill in the door? But when it comes down to the valuation. Model, what item really excited about. And here's some of the things we can do is. Think about. A marketplace.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:03:50.129Z)

And I'm entering the technology space. But I have heard over and over again in Howard says this to me as well. Whoever wins Data wins AI. Right? Like as over and over and over again. Whoever wins Data wins AI. It really comes down to that.

### You (2025-11-25T16:03:52.210Z)

For buyers and sellers. So today, a broker uses a tool, whether it's Excel or anything else. To come up with what they think the property is worth. And then they put it on the market. That's their advertised price, right? At the same time, then a seller.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:04:08.929Z)

And so what I want to chat today is, I mean, Mark, you created the best data products in the hotel industry outside of star. And so I really think that in the partnership with each other, we could win data in the industry. And if we win data, we win. I really believe that.

### You (2025-11-25T16:04:10.850Z)

Is going through the same motions to see what they think it's worth, and then they start the negotiation process. What we envision, and we develop this at rediq, but we were unable to get it to market before the sale of the company. Is what happens if a broker uses our tool.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:04:32.209Z)

And so the second thing I just want to mention, and then we'll get into the more specifics. And this is really. I don't even know if Howard has ever heard me tell the story. And Howard and I have been working together for a year. But, Mark, you said on our last call with Eva and CBRE that CBRE didn't want to pursue. One of the reasons they didn't want to pursue EVA was that it would disrupt the appraisal business. Right. If I remember. Okay, so I'm going to try to do this in two minutes because, again, it's really personal to me, but maybe. It'll help you understand why I get knocked down all the time and I just get back up. And I keep working on this because of this story. I grew up in the Midwest. I grew up in Ohio, suburb of Cleveland. And Howard and I are both from the Midwest, actually, and we use auto industry a lot in our conversations, but my dad worked at Ford.

### You (2025-11-25T16:04:32.290Z)

They put all of the information in, in a sustained information, the same historical financial statements and everything else that the seller is going to get. They come up with their evaluation model and then they share that model. They just send an email to local store. They can put it out there high as an investor. Then I click on that link. And boom, I've already got the model. I don't even do anything other than. Then I can go in and say, okay, here's my minimum required irr. I would tweak some of those inputs from my specific case. And you could literally go from listing to offer within hours. Right. So what we are doing is we're not eliminating positions, we're not trying to get rid of the analyst. We're speeding up the process. And that was the biggest thing with RoadIQ as well, is that instead of taking days or weeks or months, which is typically the manual process, you could start getting offers within days or much sooner. And the people on the investment side, especially in the institutional side,

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:05:24.689Z)

My dad joined Ford in 1975 and he worked on the line. And around 1978, 79, Ford and Chevy were disrupted terribly. By the Japanese automakers Fonda and Toyota, to the point where, if I go back and look at it, I think they lost something like 35 or 40% of their revenues in one year because of the disruption. And when you think about disruption, you can think about it in big terms. But disruption, I felt disruption as a child. My dad was laid off for years because of that. Right. And we sat around the dinner table when my dad was laid off and he talked about it. He talked about, okay, well, the Japanese automakers made a better product, right? They made a product that people wanted. They made a product that was more fuel efficient because fuel efficiency was what was driving consumer decisions back then. They made a better looking product, a better driving product. And the US Auto manufacturers, they could have disrupted themselves, right? But they chose not to. And so they chose not to. Disrupt themselves, and they were disrupted. But why I have this visceral feeling is because my family went through that, like employment, unemployment only lasts so long. And so my Berends had to sell their house, the house my mother loved. Right. It really was very, very difficult for us as a family.

### You (2025-11-25T16:05:53.090Z)

They process. Some of these companies help. They will look at every deal that comes on the market in a particular area, wherever they are looking at. Justifying the one or two. So it's really using the model to determine very quickly, like, okay, this deal will never work for us. That's not where you start time. They can move on to the next. So that's really the value that we would use coming out of the block. Look at it very quickly. Use AI and I mentioned the machine learning, but we also have already that will go out. Is when you input the information into the model. It will provide a very good summary that you can just literally copy and paste into your investment committee. Paperwork or something like that, right? It give you a high level overview. Following on the footsteps of that. Is. What if you get a deal? That looks really good. But you're not quite hitting some of those hurdles.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:06:56.849Z)

My dad always maintained. He never was like, he never. He always held out that it was the US Auto industry that did not step up and did not take the action to disrupt themselves and therefore was disrupted. He never blamed, like, you know, I mean, he was great in that regard. By showing me that what you have to do. Is get ahead of it. And so, having grown up in that environment and lived through that, my dad ended up going back to work for Ford. Things settled down. He ended up being able to have, you know, steady income into his 70s, essentially. But those years, those 10 years between, like, 1978 and 1988 and mark you probably remember, inflation at that time was something like, what, 18%? Something like just living through all of that. And so when I think about our industry, we're in disruption right now, right? It's gonna happen. We can't close our eyes and ignore it. It's gonna happen. So we need to decide. What side of this we're gonna be on, if we're gonna get ahead of it or if we're gonna be. If we're gonna be negatively impacted by it. And I wanna get ahead of it. Right? And I believe that in partnership and the right partnerships. We can do that. We can do that. For the hotel industry, the hotel investment industry. I don't wanna be one of the people that's sitting here three years from now saying, we didn't try. We didn't try to get ahead of it. We just let this, like, eat us alive.

### You (2025-11-25T16:06:59.330Z)

Instead of going all over the model and making okay, well, what if I change this? What if I change that? And just watching the changes. What if I could just push a button? Speak into microphone and say, What changes can I make in order to hit this IRR hurdle? And then within seconds, it'll come back and say it'll make the changes and say this is what you can do to meet this hurdle. All I have to do is say, okay, I'm the most reasonable changes. Can I hit this? Operating, right, and then, boom, you're done. So that really is what we need to do initially. And because that, because of the technology involved, there is going to be like the middle size companies that would really gravitate towards that. And I think a lot of the large companies like that as well. But the idea is, if we can get our foot in the door, With a model like this. People start. Generating deals and like, run iq, you might have somebody who now, instead of updating information for one or two deals, Could be 10 or 20 deals, right? So our database keeps getting bigger and bigger. Doesn't matter if they buy them or not. I don't care if they buy the deal or if somebody else does. All I want is I just want that financial statement and everything. And so our data that goes.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:08:32.049Z)

So that's my personal story. And it's. Why? Because over the past year, well, over the past five years, Marc, you know, cbre let me go. I was devastated that they wouldn't pursue this. Each day I wake up and try to figure out how to make this happen, and I think, God, that I found Howard and Vinod as partners because they're real estate professionals who understand real estate, technology and data, and I don't. I couldn't have gotten through where we are and to the progress we've gotten over the last year without them. But that's me. And that's why what drives me in this. And so I just wanted to share that story because it's not just a professional goal for me. Like, there's something that's very down, like, in my soul that is gonna figure out how to make this happen, because I just. Don't wanna be. I don't wanna be forged. Right. I don't wanna be the one that's disrupted and didn't think about how to get out in front of this. So thank. Thank you for letting me preach and with that. But I thought if you understood a little bit about me, it. Might help you understand why I'm so passionate about this. Yeah, no, thanks for sharing that. And then, Jeremy, since you're a wizard, would you take 35,000? And increase it by 3% a year till to 2025. From what year to what year? 1985. So 40 years. Now while Jeremy's doing his magic. The reason I say that, Diane. In 1985. At the old Laventhal firm. We figured out, you know, if we had an Mai. On our team. We could sell our market study hotel market studies. Which is really an appraisal as a market study with a cap rate stuck in there somewhere, simplistically thought of that we could get another $10,000. So we were fairly routinely. Getting $35,000 for a hotel market study and appraisal 40 years ago. And what is that number, Jeremy? Today? About $115,000. Okay. Now we have a sizable part of our little company. That does a bank appraisals very efficiently. For 45. $4,205,000 apiece in today's dollars. So the way I view. No, no, no. But the point being, I'm totally agreeing with you, but it's just as I view this, it's just how this, our little part of the world has progressed. Over these last 40 to 50 years. You know, we went from literally counting the number of cars in the parking lot, you know, to try to get a handle on how full is that hotel, to then trying to get good at asking questions of hotel managers that would basically trick them into giving us the answers to the questions we had without them knowing about it if they weren't willing to volunteer it to. Now, all of that labor, all of that guesswork. For all intents and purposes, has been wrung out of the system. And now we're at the point in the evolutionary cycle, as I think of it, where so much of the intelligence that, frankly, like people that like you and me, have developed in our careers. You know, that memory that we have of all the experiences, all the things we looked at, all the stuff we figured out, okay, is now in the form of bits and bytes. And so, therefore, how do we continue to stay ahead of that curve? Which then leads me to the first thing that you said. But the person that owns the data is the person that wins, so I fully agree with that. And I think having robust P and L data is a critical element. To being able to. Legitimately, believably develop a tool that makes the user comfortable that it frankly. Jeez. With each couple of clicks I'm now getting all that stuff that Diane Fox learned in her X years of career. Or the people at Laventhal or pkf, on and on. So I totally agree with you. The number one challenge is the data, which is why the number of. First thing I did when I heard about the change at cbre, I called my old boss. Who had just left. Richard Barkham, who was the global chief economist. Oh, he laughed. Or. No, he's still there. He's gone. Well, as he told me off the record, They don't like old people at cbre, so they ask him to go away. So, yeah, so that's the world we play in. So. But so then I started going through and it was very clear. This is my perception. And they're really nice people. I work side by side with them. For the time I was at cbre. They don't know what they've got. And they're afraid to make a decision. Right, period. So I continue to say, close to the situation. I think it's a new day come January 1st, because that's when the old guard, the rest of the old guard, for all types of purposes, they will then be gone. And now it's just two people. Left, as I've been told, that will oversee the trends database. And I think it's going to be an overwhelming effort. For them. So I want to stay close to that. But in the interim, I think we talked about in the last discussion. And, Jeremy, as you've begun to help us understand, there is a meaningful amount of historical financial data. That we have. You know, it's very clumsy. In terms of how it's warehoused, how we get to it. It's very narrow in terms of just the property profiles that we have in there. From that, again, going back to the cbre, that one of the things that was very robust about it, it had a lot of, you know, upper, upscale, full service stuff. And that's where, as you know, there's a lot more variation when you get into that level. Right. Then sort of like a Hamptons, a Hampton Inn, Right? And there's a little bit of variance, but, you know, you need. You don't need to have a whole lot of that to be. Able to meaningful, meaningfully understand what a hump Hampton Inn should produce from an NOI perspective given this level of top line performance. So anyway, I'll stop rambling, but I totally agree with you. That's where we are, right? And I think people you're like Howard have the brains to figure out how do you play with all that data?

### You (2025-11-25T16:15:14.930Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:15:59.089Z)

The right way. To make it to bring value to the equation. And Howard and I should. I mean, poor Howard is sitting there. I'm just, like, chatting, chatting, chatting, chatting. But going to introduce Howard. But at rediq, Howard and Vinod, who's our chief technology officer, They on the multifamily side, they took all that data and they aggregated and anonymized it, Right? Just like Benchmarker. So why I say that is we have the technology, the intellectual right way. Howard know how to do that. They know how to anonymize and they know how to aggregate, which is a big piece of benchmark. So we already have that experience. And Howard, I mean, working with a product manager on My eyes have been opened. Howard has added beyond, like, really InnVestAI is Howard. He has built this. And it's been amazing for me to see because what we have essentially done, we've taken a hotel acquisition model or valuation model, however you want to think of it, right? And we've recreated that in a SaaS platform. We want it to look exactly like Excel for our users. We want it to feel almost exactly like Excel to the extent we can. So we've done that. And I mean, that's fantastic. We've built that out. And then the second thing is we are using AI to extract data from PNLs and PDFs with a, like I'd say over a 90% success rate at this point. And we're doing it annually, removing into doing it monthly. We're testing it monthly. We want to be over 95%.

### You (2025-11-25T16:17:47.490Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah, if I. If I can jump in here real quick. I want to step back just a little bit to the discussion about the. The data as well. Just to clarify.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:17:53.569Z)

But Howard and I will turn it over to Howard in a moment. He tells me all the time that AI Is moving faster than even he thought it would move. Right. And so how our roadmap is adapting is changing monthly because of how quickly we're seeing AI adapt. But I'm so sorry. Now I'M rambling. Howard, do you want to, over the last calls I've kind of just talked over you, maybe reintroduce yourself a little bit about what you did at rediq and what we've built here at InnVestAI

### You (2025-11-25T16:18:00.770Z)

Lar. Something you said earlier was that you didn't really know, or. I don't want to misquote, but there's a question about the value of monthly data. In that from an investment standpoint, that's, that's really correct. Because I've learned that in the hotel transaction space, you look at it annually, your historical and then forward looking. But that's one of the reasons why lenders and lender services, as well as asset managers are really important to us, because they're the ones that upload it monthly or maybe quarterly.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:18:27.089Z)

It, actually, Dynam. Howard, I'm looking forward to what's in your head and so forth. But I think. Jeremy, I know there's stuff in your head. Download if you would, because that may affect how Howard says. Whatever Howard going to say. That's good. A couple of quick thoughts. What you just discussed, Dan, and it sounds like y'all built with AI. Getting what you need out of not easy to extract formats is something we've been exploring with AI. Because of, as Mark described, our database. Although we've taken some of the top line things out of it that we need on a day to day, there's a wealth of information hidden in offering memorandums and PDFs and star reports that we have not extracted. They live in our database as an attachment, but they're not searchable. They're not easy for us to use. To me, that's a huge opportunity for us, and we've had a couple of calls over last month to try to understand can we build something like that to improve our database, because it's just too manual of a process, so. That'll be interesting for us to continue to discuss. I think our other colleague, John Ricker, might need to be on the next call as well, because he built that database.

### You (2025-11-25T16:18:40.210Z)

What? Effects is the freshness of our data. So if we only get annual data. The most recent data we would have is December 31, 2024. Right. Yeah. Y. Eah. But when you have that quarterly data, and especially from lenders and others, They're going to be inputting their. Expected cap rate. They have to come up with a value to see. Does this deal with the loan to value. Will the debt service coverage work? All this other things. And I think I mentioned it in our first call. But. Where most of the people, if not all, but our offering data to the hotel industry.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:19:36.849Z)

Two other quick thoughts are a little further from this was something that always stood out to me. I got my master's in real estate here in D.C. and something that stood out to me was week one, day one of Fundamentals of Real Estate was the difference between a stock market and real estate.

### You (2025-11-25T16:19:40.050Z)

It's historical data. And again, if all we're getting is annual. It's old data. The way, that's very little value.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:19:50.689Z)

In one sentence is availability of data.

### You (2025-11-25T16:19:52.530Z)

But if I had data that was as recent as, say, October 31, as opposed to December 31 of last year,

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:19:53.649Z)

And the reason why someone can look at a comfort in and offer $10 million in somebody else can look at a comfort in for sale and only be willing to offer four is A, because the data that they had access to and then B, with that data, what they believe they can do to that asset.

### You (2025-11-25T16:20:01.490Z)

Much more valuable. So that's really again. But then that also allows us combined with.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:20:09.569Z)

And a lot of people hold that pretty close to the best because that is their strategy. That's their kryptonite. And once all that becomes publicly available,

### You (2025-11-25T16:20:09.730Z)

The investor, broker and lender Personas who are projecting forward to get that valuation.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:20:17.889Z)

Everything gets disrupted. And I'm not saying that we don't want disruption, but you may get hesitation of people wanting to give you data in that way because that is what their whole business is built on. That's kind of the first thought. The second one is in hotel valuation, it's much easier to value an extended stay or a quinta off the highway like you already discussed, than it is the Four Seasons Resort and even such that at the low end there's a room's revenue multiplier, which is a really simple way to value. You just take the room's revenue, you say on average, it's worth three to four times with the annual rooms revenue as you come up with a value.

### You (2025-11-25T16:20:18.130Z)

We would pretty much be the only company that. Has forward looking data as well. Not just looking in the rearview mirror, but we would be able to. Project out forward. Yeah, you could get a trailing 12. Right. But to get that T12 means somebody's going to have to upload this data through whatever month it is. Upload.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:20:55.729Z)

So I guess the tangential may be side quest is does it make sense to bring this to market in the economy and mid scale space? First where first of all our data is really strong, but second of all most people are probably more comfortable giving you that data using the automated valuation model and from there you can work your way up the scale where the nuances haven't really been fleshed out and the data is harder to get. Yeah. And we're kind of all in the same lines. We've been thinking about to launch it. Launch it in the places where the highest level of underwriting is done. Right. Like, it's just the por, you know, not diving into a complex full service hotel where you have to break it all that's. Later down the road. So we thought of it more along the lines of launch and debt and structured finance, where they do a very high level of underwriting. But you're exactly right. You could also launch in select service. Right. Where it is simpler underwriting. And as Mark and I know from working at cbre, I mean, me and Vaz, I literally sat in Vaz, right? The opportunities to find revenue opportunity because of even like within CMBS pools and things like that, right? There's a lot of revenue opportunity to be found if you have technology that can help automate and improve and speed up select service underwriting. So I'm all with you. I think Slut Service is a great place to enter the space. It just kind of figuring out the right strategy, right? And how to do that makes sense. So I'm curious, Howard. Of the three of us, talk long enough that you forgot about what you were going to say? There you go. And by the way, I think we have thousands, if not tens of thousands of those in our database that are just under tapped, underutilized, under extracted. So, Mark, how would you if we wanted to tackle. Because, you know, benchmarker, it's unspun gold. CBRE doesn't really understand what they're sitting on, you know, I know they think it's. I've heard this is an actual quote from Therese Rose, who is the chief operating officer now working for. I don't even know Bill Gryce, I guess who's who she works for. I had lunch with her in the fall, and she's like, yeah, that data's crap, you know? I mean, she used a different word, but, like, I. E. The detail and the mapping and the complexity. And things like that, but I really believe if we put our heads down and work together, we could remap it and get it all cleaned up. But how would we go in your mind, how would we. Like, we have the ability to process, right. And we have a team in India that we can expand on. We're having success with AI, so. And you have the relationship. You and Robert Mandelbaum have the relationships. Cbre technically owns the ip. How would you suggest we. I mean, because what I'm kind of thinking is, how do we resurrect those two products, Horizons and Benchmarker, under a new brand, a new ip, where you're. You bring your history, right? The leadership, the history, the relationships. And we bring the technology and the ability to. Process all that data. A couple things. It'd always be. I think, you know, they're standing. I'd be totally candid with you. There's a part of me. That says I no longer want to beat my head against the wall. And that's. That's what I think of when I think about going back to approach.

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:14.770Z)

Let me.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:14.849Z)

The morass of leadership at cbra.

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:15.090Z)

Take a real quick look here. Shouldn't be an issue. So the fifth is a Friday.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:20.449Z)

Having said that, that doesn't mean I'm not willing to do it.

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:23.090Z)

Actually, the only thing on my calendar on the 5th is 10:00.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:24.129Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:26.530Z)

Eastern time.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:27.009Z)

But I think I'd almost like to explore some other angles involving cberry that, for example.

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:32.290Z)

Yeah. I'm not a morning person. So after 11th is great.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:37.089Z)

Again I've been gone. Since. March of 2020.

### You (2025-11-25T16:30:41.090Z)

All. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-25T16:30:42.609Z)

So that's five and a half years now, okay? And so I don't know exactly how they're processing. Those plus or minus 7,000 financial P&L's they get every year. I do know they're getting a bunch of 3,000 monthly and the balance is all annual submissions. As a sidebar. I've never felt good about what the utility of monthly full P and L data is. I just don't because as an operator, I can really change my reporting my reporter results for this month very easily. I can push something back into next month. I can delay somebody. There's so many games you can play. But at the end of the year, it all washes out. So that's just a sidebar. What I know I can do very easily. Is find out from Robert. Robert, can you just. How are you guys processing the data today? How is it working? Now, when I first took over responsibility for that stuff, 25, 30 years ago. I guess now, I mean, we would hire a bunch of temporary people. Start in February 15th every year. And they'd key in all that data. And we slowly, over time, got much more efficient in doing it. You know, we'd get general ledger detail, we'd map it to the income statement, and that made a lot of easier. But I'm. I'm five and a half years out of touch was exactly the method they're using. In Howard. You'll. You'll quickly realize, if you haven't already, that maybe I just didn't actually understand everything that I've just heard, but what I think I heard. Was with this image versus tech stuff. And again, I'm. I'm a neophyte when it comes to technology and all that, but I get. I get the concept. That. Meaning if I got a hundred PDF files. From Crestline Hotels and Resorts. And it was the year end P and L and balance sheet. For all the hotels that they manage. I think I heard you say I can take that PDF. Take images of something. And get it into a usable format. Okay? So I hear that. I go, wow, that's. That's very interesting. But Robert may say, yeah, we were doing that five years ago. I. I don't know. So. But I'm again, it's easier for me to get current on with what he's doing. But again, the leadership at cbre, the people that make decisions like this, Well, Diane, I know you appreciate. No, I know. No, I totally know. But not. Not only because you were there. But the fact that they blew that whole practice up. He says they don't have any appreciation. For the value of that. Of that practice. And it's largely because they can't go beyond the debits and credits. Of that one business unit. They can't connect it to the lift, that you know all that stuff. So what, what, What I will do is find out from Robert. Get him to describe to me. How's it all working now? Report back to y'all. And in the angle I'm trying to take here is hearing what Howard said about. His old firm and so forth, that. Do we go to cbr he say, look, there's a better way to process all this data. And let us do it for you. And they. They either check or don't check the requisite box. That says, now we can anonymize this and use it in this bucket that we own over here. To do other things with it. Just now. Helpful. I can opine on how they probably process their data. Because it's probably how calibre did it. Okay? Go ahead. Is that. I mean, Howard, do you already know all this, or is this. Is this because this is in the tech technical side? So let. Let me know if this is helpful. I'm sure that they have APIs. Which are large data automated exports from one company into CBRE because they work with Enbridge and Marriott. And so they, they get large groups of data from single customers. So that has to be an API. It's probably monthly. And as long as the US Sally does not change. Then they don't have to do anything. Basically every line is coded the same and it goes the same place and updates. I'm sure that is automated and probably very easy now. The harder part for them is when they're trying to bring in new customers or work with smaller groups that can't afford or don't have the tech ability for an API. And then they have to figure out. How are they going to import that? Efficiently, frequently, without error. And this is Calibri's big issue too. This is why Calibri only has the big companies and cannot onboard Salamander, Margaritaville. It's not worth their time. To create all of the rules around what that company's line translates into. Calibrates version of that line for a small company to onboard 10 plus or 10 revenue strategy playbooks. It doesn't doesn't make sense. So I guess the real value might be if you can process their smaller clients because I'M sure that there's no way that they get Marriott and Ambridge in with a manual team now. It has to be, it has to be automated. And at Calibri there were probably half the company was tech related employment and that would be 20 to 25 people when I was there and probably four. Or five of the tech people were actually building the platform, the UI coding the front end, and the other 20 were doing data processing. That is the biggest expense of calorie. So if AI is really changing that. And that is as big of expense for CBR as it was for Calgary. They're probably exploring AI in some capacity. Maybe you can bring them the answer. But that's just rambling on. They're big clients, probably don't need our help. Diane, have you talked to Cindy at all about what she's up to and how she does what she does and all that? So Cindy is a tough one for me because Michelle Russo is a competitor of ours. So Michelle Russo has a platform called Single Pane. And Jeremy, you probably know this, right? Where they are taking there's a long history. It was actually Jalil McCor who built the original BI platform for Hotel AB. The original one really sucked, but they've now kind of gotten onto the idea that they could generate revenue by being a technology provider for asset managers. So Michelle's gone really, really deep into the asset management space, and she has great clients. I mean, ksl. The fact that she got to KSL before I got to ksl. Is like another heartbreak trinity. She's done a good job on the asset management side. And so why Cindy is tough for me is Cindy and Michelle have a really close relationship, and so I've been hesitant to approach Cindy. Because I'm just concerned anything. And, Jeremy, you know, you worked for Cindy, but I'm concerned anything I say will get back to Michelle. And I'm giving competitive intelligence information about our platform to a competitor. And Michelle's pretty ruthless, at least in my experience, working for her, so she's of anyone. Chm Warnick is doing this too, but I just have the most concern about leaking any details about InnVestAI. You know that Cindy could potentially go tell Michelle. So I know that's a strange answer, but that's why. But who I have, I do have a great partnership with as a woman named Carol Hensel. She owns a company called Dragonfly Strategists, and she is launching a technology initiative as well. She works with a lot of independents, and she works. She's only on the revenue side, so she's not on the expense side. Like, she doesn't do any of the P and L data, but. She is launching a technology initiative right now to compile for independence, so she's a great resource for me. But I haven't approached Cindy because I'm just concerned about that Michelle as a closer relationship with her than I do. I mean, Jeremy, is that. Should I be concerned about that? That's where. I mean, that's where my head's been. But perhaps I'm overthinking the whole thing. I don't know if I have any helpful comments on that one. I know they are close, but I don't know how their relationship works. I also do know they're building a tech platform as a CHM Warnick, and I guess this kind of goes back to whoever owns the data wins the race. And does it make sense? This is a big question, but does it make sense to try to build this in a vacuum, or does it make sense to try to get funded by CBRE or HVS or one of the big companies, to be that internal arm for them? We would definitely consider that. We talked about Berkadia. I've talked to derese about cbre. I mean, I think I have a strong enough relationship with derence that she would listen to me. And Mark, if you have a strong enough relationship still with some people at cbr, like, I think if we, if we combined our resources and our. And our relationships, we could go back to CBRE and talk about a partnership. But Howard has. I mean, it's close with Berkadia as well. I mean, I'm just. I'm just talking. We have thought about trying to work with a bigger company to help fund us. It's been something that we thought about. The only other angle that comes to mind is maybe the software that you're pitching is an AI data. Templatization tool. For all the small and medium firms that can't figure it out themselves or overwhelmed by AI Let us come in and let us create you a BI tool. Which is now the easy part with AI but the harder part that you can use AI is because we need to right size all your data and put it in a usable format. Maybe that's, maybe that's what you're selling at the beginning because really need to amass data. And I think there'll be a lot of. I mean, that's what we're trying to find. We're trying to find a way to take all the data we have and make it more useful. And I think there's a lot of small and medium firms out there that have that data, don't know how to use it and think AI can solve it. But we have calls and we just quickly realize this is a little too technical for us, or AI usability is not quite there yet, or we're not comfortable with data security. There are some things that come up quickly for us to give us pause, but we certainly must. But we're building our platform around all of those things. We understand we plan to be SOC 2 compliant. We have a roadmap from others in CRE. I do want to mention one thing that's though very different from the way Michelle is building her platform. And CHRM is they're only focused on a very sliver of asset management. I have approached this from completely different angle and it comes from my time at cbre, really researching other firms that have been successful and my own experience in hotel investing. And that is this is a deep we're going at it from the deal perspective. Right. Because companies care about asset management. But the at the end of the day, they're fine having their analysts key in information. Right. But deals are a different thing. They want a win. Deals. They want to do deals. Right. And so this is like deal enablement as kind of how we're position we're going deal in. So if you almost think of it from an investment lifecycle perspective. Right. Start at the transaction point. And that's what rediq did, being underwriting software to speed up the underwriting. Right. And then once you've got the all the information and the underwriting tool, what makes it very easy then just to say, well, now let's keep it here and you can do your asset management work. Right? And look this. If we are essentially capturing the data upfront from a deal process, then we can share that much easier with the 10 lenders that you're looking at for the loan. Right. Or the appraiser that you are selecting. Right? Like we're trying to think about it. You have a. You have certain data that gets used for every single transaction. Right. Om. And so how do you look at that data and how it's being. Someone explained this through the entire value chain, right? Of. So our Personas are essentially the investor up front, the person doing the acquisition. Right. The lender, the appraiser. The management company, because they're doing a lot of underwriting, the brand and. Howard, who am I missing? Who's the six? Management companies do underwriting. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like we have six. It's the investor, it's the lender, it's the appraiser, it's the. Oh, the broker. We're thinking about brokers as well as, like, being in the value chain. So that's, that's. And I feel because of all the work. I've done. I feel very strongly that you're going to get better buy in from the industry. If we approach it from a transaction perspective. Because people, we're all deal junkies and they care about deals, right? And so they care about deals a lot more than they care about asset management. So that's, that's when we're taking playbooks from the, like the, you know, the deal paths and. The other successful ABMS and multifamily and through other commercial real estate software that's had a lot of success and going out at the same way they have versus. How Michelle's doing it and just focusing on asset management. So did you consider at all that maybe your tool is an underwriting AI enabled AI forward underwriting tool and as you sell that, you are collecting the data? Because the hardest part of saying I have an automated valuation model is you need the data to back test and prove it. But just having it alone. If I can just drop in the OM from the broker and it already populates most of my model, and then all I need to do is put my inputs. Then you're collecting data and you're providing value. Yes. Without a valuation model, though, it's. Well, it's not an automated valuation model. It's like an AI enhanced. You and Howard are going to be best friends because Howard tells me all the time that's where. That's what our name is now. Okay, well, because old school Diane, we're now this conversation a long time ago just saying automate evaluation model to me. It has a reaction that comes with 50 thoughts about why that could never work. And I'm sure it could, but it comes with my first reaction. Is I can't trust it. There's a lot I need to understand what you're doing, but maybe really what you are doing is just speeding up the underwriting process while you are gaining the data in order to actually be trusted. Yes. You got to get landed on it. That's what we're trying to do? Yes. And, Howard, can you jump in here? Right. And then if we can then fill the need of the asset management community, then we keep the data. Right? Like you get it once when you're. You get it through the deal process, but then if you roll out an asset management product that is just adjacent to it, then no one has to go reset up, right? Like single pane or anything like that. You just continue. The data is already set up and it just. Keeps flowing, flowing, flowing all the way through disposition. And I just want to mention, too, because I did send you some really old docs from cbre, which I'm probably legally prohibited from doing, but they're, like, a decade old. And the VTS costar deck the last slide. Slide 14. They CBRE basically knew what Howard is describing. CBRE included as the last page of that tech. Like this is the future it's called. It's basically brokerage will be digitally enabled and there will be outside companies that automate the process. And digitally enable the deal process. Right. So whereas in the case of this, I think they were really talking more about the occupier side. But it's same on capital market side. The future of brokerage brokers will always play a role, but they may not play the role of like, again, doing the models. And things like, and transferring the data like they do now, they'll probably play in more of the role of just the deal making, right? Creating a competitive process and structure. But how I think Howard and I look at this and we think five years out, what our goal would be is for InnVestAI to be a marketplace. Like where it is the marketplace where deals transact, essentially. And we haven't gotten into any of the future. But Mark, when we think about a potential data partnership, which is how I think about us working together. Howard is right. The AI augmented underwriting is how I should say it is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm starting to do some work right now with companies on how we could start to digitize and pull up PIP data, like capex data renovation data. Right. Because that no one has done that. And there's actually platforms out there that could help you do that. How do you start to digitize the closing process of a hotel? Right. The operating prorations and the when you get through to the HUD statement on the closing. If you get to the HUD statement on the closing. Right. And you actually are using our tool for underwriting, then what we know is NOI plus actual purchase price. So we would have the first accurate cap rate information which from a data perspective, whoever wins data wins AI. Right. So I am starting to focus now as like Howard is now built out the underwriting piece of it. I'm starting to focus on. Okay. Now, how do we figure out how to digitize and pull up all that renovation capex information and create data and data structure around that? How do you essentially help people close hotels faster? By using AI? Because AI can do closing probations, they could do operational prorations. And the third is I'm starting to do some research around a platform called Harvey, because Harvey is a legal platform. And most of the major law firms in real estate are starting to use Harvey. And so all of our real estate attorney friends in the hotel investment space are going to be using Harvey to speed up the purchase and sale and the JV agreements and all. Of that. So how do we think about having integrations and agentic AI relationships with Harvey, just like Dealpath and others in the CRE space. But that's where I go back to. I'd really love to have a holistic data partnership with Woodworth Core because you guys scream. I mean, mark your involvement. It just. It's such a validating thing for our industry. You're a brand, right? That people trust you and they trust what PKF was and what you created in data. And so if we could think about ways to create a holistic data partnership beyond just. I mean, we're talking about. P&L's and horizons to begin with, but around Capex, around other things. I just think your branding brings so much to the table. And then we cover the technology piece of it and the legality part and the security part of it and all of those things that are kind of beyond what you, what you all would with CORE would do on a day to day basis. Does that make sense kind of in big picture? Yeah. Well, a couple things. Thanks for saying all those nice things about me. It's particularly timely given that, again, Jeremy's kind of upset with me lately, so that'll make him feel a little better, that stuff. But you're very kind. I'm getting it. I mean, it's at a pretty high level, but I'm getting it. And some of the notes I've taken. I will reach out to Robert immediately. To have him describe to me the process, the state of the art process. That they're currently engaged in. And getting that data into the hopper for benchmark or purposes. And then I'll set up a follow on call. With whomever. Howard, I don't know if you want to get into that level of detail or. Diane, you can hear it directly and then translate it to Howard and all that kind of stuff. So let's at least find out, because if we could somehow get our hands on that. It's a great start. That's a five run grand slam out of the box. So if we can hit that one, terrific. I'd also like to then Jeremy, have a follow up call with specifically you and Howard and John Richter on our shop so Howard can hear directly from John. Here's the various formats. That our stuff is in. Here's how we got it and here's how we're warehousing and how anything else that you would want to know about it to better understand how useful might the stuff we already own. I mean we. We own it. B to help moving the ball down the field the right way. And I think, Jeremy, I think we could probably make those two things happen real quickly. So I very much like, like to do it. I think, on the CBRE front, I think we need to learn as much as we can over the next 30 days before the current regime is all gone. I mean, Robert leaves, right? Do I have Robert Mandelbaum leaves at the end of the year or no. He's. His Last day is January 1st. Okay. And there are two people, as I've been told, that will then be charged with managing the trends database. One of whom I'd hired 20 years ago. And then it just turns out his son that they hired after I left. But. So I know Gary very, very well. So that that's. That may or may not be relevant. What we learned from Robert, how they're doing what they're doing, and share that with y'all. I think you're going to feel either good or not good. About this idea of. Okay, wait a minute. We got a better way of doing what you're doing. And much more efficient, much more accurate. And we'd welcome the opportunity. To process the data for you. Yeah, we'd be even happy to, like, if we could strike a deal is to take those two people and pull them onto the InnVestAI team, right? So that maybe they don't be like. And that becomes part of CBRE's. I don't know, maybe you called an investment or something like that. But if I just. I'm just brainstorming. They might not want to do something like that, but it could be something that we could work out with them if they, you know, if they'd be willing to help us with the contribution of those two people, then we would all be working in sync and trying. To figure out the quickest best way to. Yeah. And I'm. I'm confident, Diane, that. When we begin to learn what they're doing and how they're doing it. There'll be many more ideas at surface of how we can collaborate. So right now I want to have take really a singular focus. Yeah. On two things. Get current with Robert and how they're doing what they're doing. And two, Jeremy, if you could coordinate with Howard, getting some time with John. And then. Once John understands exactly the formats that our information is are in and how they're being warehoused. Howard, are you either going to feel good or not good or something? About just the utility of the information we already own. And then see where it takes us. Okay, sounds good. Got it. Yep, yep. Good. Point. Trailing 12 is really important to deals, right? The trailing 12 and the trailing 12. Yeah. And I totally agree. I totally agree. Yeah. Okay. Book. And I. I. Howard, I absolutely, totally agree. Yeah. And what I think of just the annual stuff, it's for benchmarking purposes. But, but, but I totally agree. Annual obviously, is not necessarily just calendar year. It's fiscal year. Right. So. Right. And Mark. All right. Yeah, I I I have to jump in. Jeremy has that look on his face like something's troubling is what's bothering you. Yeah. Spinning my hand for a while, and it's a little bit of a sideways comment, but maybe it's helpful. I always found a caliber. That we focus too much on the use case. And not enough on what we were actually doing, which was providing unique data that nobody else had. And we tried to create a new product or get a new business line. And my very first Mark mentor was Mark Lomano. And so I've been blessed in my career to have a lot of great marks at my side. And Mark Lomana, who built str, said something that always clicked with me. Because we marked a lot and I were the little incubator trying to figure out how to take what Calibri had built and bring it to the real estate market. And it was quite simple. We just recreate what STR does, but with calibrate data. The same format, the same output, the same data structure. So our clients can just put it right in their models without changing anything. And it's quite simple. And within a year and a half, we were a million dollar business. And we didn't even need a coder. It was an Excel output. But I guess the cautionary tale, I think, is that Calibri is just the only lake in the desert that all animals have to come drink at. And no matter what you do or how you're using it, you need to drink the water. And the more we focused on, well, what does Wall street need? We have to create a new product for Wall street. And, okay, now we have asset managers. They need something different. They didn't like what we had to build because we didn't know their business as well as they knew their business. All they ever wanted was the raw data. And so I think the cautionary tale there is for the last 20 minutes we've talked about really specific use cases, a broker platform, Harvey ask for data extracting. To me, the simple thing is you're creating an AI enabled valuation model because we all on this call know underwriting really well and AI and are the first to pair that. And literally this weekend, at a birthday party, a one year old's birthday party, I met somebody who's working on the Harvey of construction. In new york city. And to me, there's an arms race in San Francisco and New York City of people creating AI tools nonstop. But what we have that's unique is our understanding of hotel underwriting and our relationships with those that underwrite. And I guess so I think there's two cautionary tales. One is the smartest people in the world with the best coding experience are trying to build this right now. And they have lots of money that doesn't require a return the way that we do. Right. It's like San Francisco, one out of every 50 needs to work kind of money. And then two is the more you focus on case studies, I think you lose audience. You lose certain audiences. They get caught up in those. Details. And they start to think about how what exactly you said doesn't fully make sense for them. For example, the broker thing got me going in like. I think that use case is interesting, but have you asked a broker. Because a broker likes to write one way. And maybe we have to end here. And this would be where we pick up. But that's a really good because we've been even talking internally at what point we can't build the perfect product. Right. And so we started last week. Howard and I had an informational interview with Stacy Naldoni, who's now at Western alliance bank talking about exactly what Stacy needs. Right. What does Stacy need at Western Alliance Bank? We may think we know what Stacy needs, but I'm not a lender. I've been involved with lending. And Stacey was very eye opening. Like what we were doing what Stacy wants. But then you call Wells Fargo, and Wells Fargo wanted something different. And then you call bank of America. And that was the calibri conundrum, as we were chasing one person with one strong preference and then bringing it to their counterpart, thinking what we built for Wells Fargo was going to work. For bank of America. That's great. All they really wanted was raw data. That was it. Calibres still does not sell raw data to anybody because they want to be a SaaS tech platform, but to me, they have a goldmine of data. So I think the whole. The most interesting thing in the last hour, for me at least, and again, I'm just one person, is this is the ability to underwrite using AI. And through that, you just let everybody do what they want to do and you learn from them. What are they doing? How are they using it? Who's calling you and asking you what? Does cbre wanted. Or does. Maybe management companies want it, maybe governments want. You just don't know. I mean, think if you ask Cindy, that's really, really who she thought her clients would be. I guarantee you they're not the same clients they have 12 years later. Right. Maybe to end this call is you can already see the value that this conversation has had. Right. Like, for your perspective on us, our perspective from. And I really do think there's a partnership opportunity here. And, Jeremy, all the things you're saying are great. I mean, and I think they could be incredibly valuable to. How we think about the future of InnVestAI And now let's jump back to rounding out this. Mark, you're right. Like, the next couple things are kind of tactical, right? Call Robert, like, see? And then let's get john and Howard and Jeremy, you guys connected, to talk and just see if we can make a couple tactical connections here and then circle back as a group. Right. And see where we could maybe jump off from. Is this fair from a partnership perspective? Because you bring the value of the branding and the industry and the connections, and I hope we bring the value of the technology and, like, our understanding of real estate and how to create security and the data. And, Jeremy, all the things that you're bringing up are really interesting for us to think about as we build out the product. Well, Diane, you should know, too. I already like Howard more than Jeremy, so. Jeremy? He's totally kidding you. I'm used to it. But can I just close on this? Because I know Howard comes from multifamily, and I did a very unique thing by reaching out to partner with someone in multifamily. I don't think anyone in hotel investments would have ever thought to do that. But it has been. It has made all the difference in the world. Because I know hospitality. Mark, you know hospitality. Jeremy, you know hospitality, right? But Howard knows real estate. And so we are what we are at the end of a day at the end of the day is we're a fintech company. That's. It's really. We're a cre fintech company. It's just specializing in a very unique niche, which is hospitality. And no one has figured that out yet. It's wide open, blue ocean space. Right. And Howard brings like that ability to think about it from that perspective, which has just been completely game changing for this. And CoStar's acquisition of STR is proof that that's the way the hotel sector is moving. We are merging in with the greater real estate world. Yes, but we kind of sit on our island of Granola I mean, I call, I joke about it. Right. And just we sometimes don't think about the fact. Like Mark with Tortoise Wheaton. Right. Like we are a real estate asset class hotels. Is it? Right. I mean, we're part of that ecosystem and. None of the solutions that are being developed and utilized and consumed and to great success. Like if you look at Deal Path and what their clients have to say, they love the platform, right? Because of how much ease, how much value it adds and speeds up their process. No one has figured out how to bring that to hotels, but we can. I mean, we can do that. And it's, it's a unique value proposition compared to single pane and profit. It. That, that is really, I think, different and a unique way to roll this out. So thank you for listening to us. I know we're 10, 15 minutes over and you both have to go, so. No, it's. It's. It's. Thank you for thinking of us. And it's fun brainstorming. And, Jeremy, I'd like if you'd carry the ball on connecting Howard and John. Let me know when you guys set something up, and if I'm available, I'll join you. I'm going to reach out to Robert immediately. And just kind of get the latest from him, but then also ask him. If he'd be willing to have a call like this, and then he can tell you two directly. This is how cbr, CBRE is doing it. But here's how they're. Here's how many data partners they have. Here's how they're getting the data. Here's how they get it into the system. Both that which arrives monthly, the monthly frequency, that which is just annually, and other stuff that'll fall out of that. That sounds good. Those are great. Next steps. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you, Howard. How's the 5th? How's December 5th for you? Just. This is probably easier than a bunch back and forth. John and I are both traveling a lot the next two weeks, but I think we're here at December 5th. Okay, so anything after 10. Or after 11. Okay, sounds good. All right. Great. Perfect. Okay. All right. Thanks. Have a great holiday. Yeah, have a great Thanksgiving. Bye. Bye. Bye.
