# Transcript for: Jim+InnVestAI Catch Up

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:02:12.109Z)

They had a ton of the people that you and I know. I walked around the hotel council room, and I know that I've done deals with 85, 90%. 90% of the room. And it was, it was everyone that you know, you remember, it was. It was fun. It was fun. That's a pretty powerful council, isn't it? Or am I off on that? It is. And I think that traditionally it is. And I was asking about that and they said at one point in time, I guess several of them picked up and went to some other council, some other age la camps Council got it, I guess, which, I mean, I don't really care about that. I've always been of the opinion. Of. Was it Twain? I forgot. Whoever said I never want to be part of a club that would actually have me. I just. I have. I don't. I just. I just don't care about stuff like that. I never have, you know? Hey, do you want to be. Do you want to be part of this One more meeting? No. No, I don't. I really don't. It's. It's bad. And it's not what you should do, right? It's not about. And I don't. I don't look at Uli like a giving back thing. I look at it like. I mean I. I understand it, but I can figure out everything I need that is happening out of Uli when they all get out and talk about it afterwards. I don't. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yes. The post morons that are done on LinkedIn and stuff like that. Yep. But I do admire people. Who advocate for the industry and drive forward and stuff like that. It's just not me. Right, Right. And how is. How is the job at Airbnb? Well, first, before we get there, let me. Howard on. So let me introduce you guys, and I'll give it over to each of you to talk about your background, but to people that I have such high respect for. So I'm happy. To introduce you guys because I just don't think the world of both of you. So Jim Howard is really my anchor partner and InnVestAI, and he'll explain his background in a few moments. But he came from the multifamily sector, and he was the product manager of a multifamily avm. Automated valuation model that was owned by Berkadia, sold to a company called Radix. But I just knocked on his door and I knocked on his door and I knocked on his door for years and years and years, and finally the right time came. We decided to partner on this because there's nothing like it in the hotel industry. And so Howard, again, I'll turn it over to you guys to talk, but he has been like, without Howard, we would not have gotten to where we have gotten on the hotel avm. It's clear in the rearview mirror. That the job of product manager was such a key role in us being able to create the avm. And so really kind of like how there's. There's a. There's five of us. But I think Howard and I and our partnership across sectors and our ability to understand what we're trying to do in real estate has been huge. And then Howard Jim, I have known almost my entire career since I was really, really young and he was really, really young. Jim it was Starwood, right where I first met you. I just had just started Starwood and we were working on the 1200 room Weston iDrive, which. Never happened. Yes. Yes, that's it. That's what it was. And so I spent. Well, he spent probably years of his life. I spent a year of my life on that hotel. And it was when I was at Lunley's. It was just a fascinating experience. Watch. Like the investment committee waiver back and forth. On if they were going to do the deal and ultimately didn't do the deal. But that's how I met him. He was in business development for Starwood, and he was the brand person on that job. And then since he's gone on to do just some really amazing things in his career, Including a short lived stint as CEO at Radisson. Right? CEO. Pretty short. Yeah. Yep. But quite the story. And now he is head of residential for Airbnb. So really interesting background and does things that are maybe, you know, kind of on the fringe and not afraid to take risks and things like that. So, anyway, now I should just open it for you guys to chat and introduce yourselves, but wanted that background.

### You (2025-11-11T14:06:59.150Z)

Sure. I'll go ahead and start. Pleasure to meet you. Diane mentioned that women, commercial real estate myself. For about 30 years. The first half has been pretty much entirely a multifamily asset management. So. Comes with both. Property. Operations, background, but also acquisitions, dispositions, renovation, And the multifamily side. But I also had a very strong affinity for. Reporting. Analytics. And excel. So about 15 years into my career, I was living in Dallas at the time. And had some connections at RealPage. And they asked me if I would be. Willing to come on board to assist with the development of their central reporting product, which was their first attempt. To create. A single. Reporting platform. And if you're familiar with RealPage,

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:08:02.109Z)

I am several of our team. The predominant employee on our team came from Urban Door. And a ton of urban door people were real page people.

### You (2025-11-11T14:08:21.470Z)

You know, the real page business model is growth by acquisition. Build anything, work it from scratch. Right. So that was our first attempt at a consolidated data warehouse. Putting that together. But. I got bit by. The tech bug. At that point. So I went over to the dark side permanently. Have been involved in commercial real estate prop tech. For the last 15 years. A lot of it with utility management, with conservatives and also real page utility manager. But in2021. I had an opportunity to join. Company called Redi. Q. Which. Is. What diane was. Mentioning they were owned by. Berkadia and it is a multifamily AV. N model. And. It was for many. Years, the. Leader in the industry. They got sold today. I'm sorry. I've got a little test thing going on here. We were soldier addicts. In. 2000 and 24. Year ago august. But it was a great partnership, but. Really bad timing. That. Radix was up to their neck. Involved with that Real Page class action lawsuit. And so. They had to do a complete pivot on their core product. So they took all my engineers and they took all that marketing people, addicts, and left Red IQ out to dry.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:10:03.229Z)

Oh, I've seen that happen. Airbnb. Airbnb did. Some similar things during Covid. I mean, there were entire business lines Airbnb walked away from and deprecated and didn't pay. Like we. We haven't invested. Hardly. You know, much more than maintenance money in in hotel tonight since the pandemic. I mean, we did. It still does. Well, makes money for us, but we just don't. We just don't. We just don't. We don't treat it the way I think we should.

### You (2025-11-11T14:10:37.870Z)

That's exactly what happened with Rediq. And they kept two junior engineers. To keep the lights on and everybody else was let go.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:10:45.389Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T14:10:48.990Z)

So back in january, The owner, the CEO, is also from kosovo. And his entire family. And all of the engineering team has based there. So. What was remaining of Rediq. Is. Now operated out of the Kosovo office, et cetera.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:11:10.669Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-11-11T14:11:11.230Z)

But. Yeah, they're in time to Red Echo is when I met Diane because Berkadia had just opened. Their first. Office. Dealing in hospitality. Prior to that. They were pretty much all. Multifamily.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:11:24.109Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-11T14:11:24.430Z)

So Diane and I got talking at that time, and she brought up the idea. Of a Rediq version for hotels. Which is interesting. And so we continued to talk. But of course, after. The. After Berkadia, Silver and iq. The owner of. Radix had no interest whatsoever in anything other than multifamily. That was their core product. So didn't really see what you're feeling.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:11:52.189Z)

And by the way, by the way, in my booth, in my booth, in my, in our vertical Airbnb for real estate, afa, Airbnb friendly apartments. I mean, essentially, our group is. I mean, I'm the only person in our. In our entire team who doesn't do apartments. Everyone else is a part of.

### You (2025-11-11T14:12:12.910Z)

There's a lot of us, that's for sure. But, yeah, I think, obviously there's a silver lining to everything. And when the team was dissolved in January, I started speaking. Again to diane. Once again she mentioned there's nothing like this in hotel. I have to admit, I was skeptical. At first, because I'm thinking every asset class out there has some type of an ABM or model similar to this. And. I did research and looked everywhere and could not find one for hotels. So, yeah, we found ourselves in nice little beach.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:12:45.149Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-11T14:12:47.710Z)

And that's what we are today. We've got our proof of 10. Start working. Our MVP is going to be ready in about two weeks. So we can start going out. And working with some partners. But that's my background.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:13:02.269Z)

That's great. That's great. It's interesting that. Well, we can talk about this. We can talk about this other part later because we have a. We have an immediate need for. Programmatical. Potentially programmatical. Multifamily underwriting because we're quietly launching a MES fund to or for. Affordable or and probably workforce housing. For. Most likely, it'll be 100% dedicated to Graystar. Just because there are largest partner and they're the ones doing the deal sourcing. And so our team is like, you know, saying internally, like, hey, we gotta underwrite this stuff. And everyone's looking up and going, we don't have a multifamily underwriter on staff, and you have to ask. Yourself that, you know, at what point in time, as a public company, do you, if you're gonna put money out, do you have to do, you know, a. A required level of due diligence? Because it's all, it's all materiality. I mean, a quarter billion dollars of a MES Fund sounds. Like it's a lot for some people. We have $13 billion in treasury, so it's not that much. Shareholders wouldn't think that it's something to casually throw around without underwriting. But essentially we. We can talk about that later, but keep going.

### You (2025-11-11T14:14:34.750Z)

I'm. Done. That's my background. So any questions you have.

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:14:39.389Z)

I, I don't because unfortunately, I'm familiar with I I. Fortunately, I'm familiar with what product does I'm familiar with. With RealPage. And I certainly I started off look, I was an mai, so I understand the valuation. You know, from the point of view of the technical basis and background of it. I haven't written an appraisal report since a number, you know, had all nines in it, basically. But. Yeah. And. And don't care to. Don't care to. Right? But it does. It does. It's certainly something that's missing in the hotel industry from. From everything. And so Howard brought our chief technology officer over as well. So we have a chief technology officer. 3 Software engineers in India. That have been working on this. We have another co founder, Drew Wallace, who is really hotel data. You know, his hotel data inside and outside. Sally, like all of it. And so he's been very valuable and myself. And then we have one co founder that's more on the brokerage side to try to bring in some of the relationships, which I can talk about later. But what our vision is is like we, we want to have the ABM service, what we'll call like six to eight different Personas or user groups. Right. The. Basically the same model, just different UIs of it. And so we're going to start with debt, unstructured finance. Because we think that is a high level underwriting and there's a need for pipeline management tool that accompanies it companies. It it can also potentially help us move into the loan servicing side of it. So try to get your underwriting tool out there right with the pipeline management so that the groups like Peachtree and groups like Western alliance bank and Access Point Financial. Right. That underwrite hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of deals a week. A week can just start to move through it very quickly. And. And this will be the last thing I say. And then Jim will turn it over to you. Howard has this fantastic analogy. We both come from the Midwest, and the auto fact, you know, auto has been a big part of our lives. He's like, it's kind of like right now, our product is if you were to look, if we were building a car, it's like we have the engine and we know the engine works, right? Engines working great. We built the body. And the body is working great. And so now what we need to do is put the engine in the body, right, to get the car working. We've been using AI for that. We have been using AI for data extraction. Our success rate gets better every day. It's not perfect. Right? And we're still working. With annual data just to try to prove out the concept. But we're getting close to 90, a little over 90% at this point. And again, using AI to do it. The sad thing is that this is what we're working on, is structured data. And there are ways to actually transfer the structured data without having to completely use AI and data extraction. And if that makes sense, right? It's like the data is coming from management companies and it's going into profit soared. And it's like there's just. There's a very clear solution on how to start to transfer this data so that we could be using our time and energy on other aspects. But. And then from debt and structured finance, then appraisal, acquisition, underwriting, management, company Berends It's like you can just start to see how the workflows all come together. How we will eventually then start to partner with groups like, you know, pair of you or others so that we just end to end data connection acquisition to disposition right up through fundament. And then I'm starting to work on this coming up year on. Howard working on some things. Howard game more on the AI. Side right now, and I'm starting to work on the capex workflows. So renovations, pips, how do we digitize that? Who do we partner with? Right. Pro, core, Norse fire, FF and E vendors. Like, there's really a solution that within 12 to 18 months, like the AVM, we could have a digital pip product that changes the life of people in the hotel industry. So we're so excited about where we are, but we're now at the point where we need to do some demos with potential customers, get some feedback, and then we need to raise our working capital and we need raise as little as we can. Possibly live on for the next six, nine, 12 months. But that is going to mean we need to bring on our, you know, our chief technology officer full, because we're all just doing this off the side of our desk at this point. And so we need to actually pull people and we actually do need to go out. And start to tap our friends and family in the industry, people who understand that technology is going to that we're at this point of inflection, right? And, like, what has made a successful in the past is going to be different in the future, and that would like to be part of that. And so that's why I'm reconnecting with you because one, you're as smart as anyone and I mean, you're so strategic and smart and hospitality industry and I'd love to demo the product in December when we're ready. And then also just get your ideas on maybe who should talk to and you know, things like that. So. So now. But let me turn it over to you, because Howard didn't really get to hear your story. Be in. Your story is such a good story. So do you mind for a few minutes, sharing with Howard? No. Yeah, I will. Much, much more interested in hearing what you guys are doing. I'll keep it kind of short and sweet. Airbnb brought me over because I'd done more branded residential and condominium hotels than most people had. And the focus at Airbnb for a while was on a there's a ton of purpose built condominiums that are purpose built for short term rental. And so it was just a convergence of those two. They're just not that many people available at the senior level who knew a lot of these developers. And so it was just a, it was like a unique and perfect fit. My background before that, as I was the CEO of Radisson for about 20 months. It was a sippy ass, ordered separation. Radisson was ordered by the federal government to split apart as a company because we were Chinese owned. And I accomplished that split. And then I got the company under contract of Choice Hotels. And then my board didn't need me anymore, so I left. Prior to that, I was a global chief Development Officer for Wyndham. Hotels for what is now Starwood Hotels. It was SH Hotels then. I was the head of North American Development for Starwood Hotels back in the day. And I've been at probably. I mean, I've got occupational ADD. I've been at 17 different companies and I usually. The longest I ever stay is like. Six years. I just generally bounce around and get bored and try to keep moving so they don't catch up. But that's. But as you were talking, it was making me. Think. I mean, my God, costar, I would want to be all over you guys, I would think. I mean, because, you know, the connections to be able to have that real time nightly data, which is crazy. I mean, it's. You don't necessarily want to be getting to that granularity because hotels certainly aren't valued that way, but the data sources that they do have are so unbelievably robust, and I'm surprised so far that they haven't. The costar hasn't made a move on air DNA yet. They may be waiting for it to get a little cheaper. Because that is at a point where the fund that invested in Air DNA does need to sell Alpine. Right? It's an Alpine fund. And I think, and I mean, it's definitely on the market. Right. But this is, this, this is, I would think, right up, right up that, that technological alley. Have you, have you spoken at all to Stacey Silver at. I mean, she does a lot with Fair Ventures. In the very beginning I did. And she's on my all round trip with Stacy. I've also talked with Chelsea, who's a junior VP of development at their Venture Partners. We're probably just, we're at like the angel fund or that. The angel stage. Not fun. Right. So essentially, if we could. Find 5 to 10 people to write 75k to 100k safe note and checks for us, right? At a reasonable pre money valuation. That gives us working capital to put our heads down and spend the next year. I'll just call it a year, right, doing these handful things, finding our first customers, which we want. To focus on some enterprise customers, right? Because it's and some mid sized customers at the same time. We have to be realistic. The enterprise customers need us desperately because just that no one's going to come solve the hotel problem. Right. The real estate problem will get solved, but no one is outside of hotels is going to come in and figure out how to do this for hotels. So if we could just say, okay, we have, look, investors, we have Access Point and we have Western alliance and we have Peachtree and, you know, and we actually did secure our anchor Investor, too, for 75k. I can't disclose who it is, but it's a very. Well, you don't have to. Try. Have you talked. You talked to Trebi? We haven't talked to Tremont, but it's funny you mentioned that because. Access Point Financial has been frustrated with Trymont, trying to get Tremont to come up with a solution. And Trymont has not come up with a solution for them, which, I don't know, opens a door for us with them. But, I mean, sometimes it did pop into my head last week. Maybe we should be going. After Treimont, too, as a potential customer. Yeah, I can get. Because I can get you hooked up with Kevin Gallagher. And he is running the hotel platform over there now. He was former Prism, president of Prism, and then he got bought by. They got bought by Ambridge like everyone did. And then he's no longer there. He's been try, I think over a year. Came out of development side. Certainly understands this business quite a bit. But I would definitely think he would be one to talk to. And then you've got. You've got, you know, Buckhead America here with Dipping Patel, who definitely, you know, makes, you know, speculative investments and so does. And then he potentially got Noble as well. Oh, my God, I want Noble so bad. Or Highgate. Ventures. Highgate Ventures. Actually, I stay away from. I stay away from. I've heard some very predatory things about Highgate Ventures. Like, okay, that's good. Like, they treat their investments like hard money. Okay? Which is not how anyone needs a. That's not how we want to be. Right. We want people that want. To have a place and changing the history of the hospitality industry. Right, that, I mean, because again, we're going to need to go heads down, we're going to need to be very focused on our clients. We're going to need to walk through the Personas and like Howard as the, as the product manager, we've got the AVM built, right. So, but now what we need to do is customize for our first customer the UI for lenders. And so that's going to look a little bit different than it does for a general acquisition person, or different than it does for a management company, business development. But it's the insane model, right? And it's the data flows up the same, all of it, all of the cores the same. It's just. It's definitely not different metrics. I mean, you know, I mean, you know, you're getting down to debt yield and valuation. And although, I mean, anyone at I mean, when you're underwriting for private equity, I mean, you're looking at debt yield anyway, too. So you're not, you're, you're looking. I don't know that the screens are that. That different. Certainly not above noi. They're no different. But I think that, you know, some. Of it. I guess the, you know, the modeling, the modeling that happens on partnership and stuff like that is irrelevant because they're going to dump it into that model anyway. But this is just. This is more valuation. Yeah, I think that. Yeah, it's valuation is connecting those workflows. Right. Because that's why. We need to come after and get that capex pip workflow done pretty quickly. I mean, when and Tomi quickly is like a year. Because it takes building the partnerships. And you know this very well, right? Like, if we can create a partnership where we have an agentic AI relationship with North Spree and Procore. And then some of These specific hotel, FF&E providers that are in the business and are tracking renovation costs as well. Then it may even be interested being an investor in us. I think that if our soon our core model has a few things, which is the pipeline management like deal path, the AVM piece of it, the capex piece of it. Then we start to work, and we have our hand out trying to integrate with Harvey, which is legal workflows, right? Because we need those in our business. Those are really important, and they're emerging as the clear winner in real estate. And legal and legal tech. And the hotel attorneys I know are their firms are starting to use Harvey. And then the last is the closing workflows, and you just put those all together. So now you start to have the end to end connectivity with the same underlying data, essentially. Right. It's all the same underlying data. Can I stop you there for one second? Unfortunately, I have a hard stop at our house. I got a hard stop right now. Can we schedule another 30 minutes? I'd like to keep going. I'm pretty open in the mornings. For the rest of this week. Sure. I'm sorry to inconvenience, but. There. No, no, no. I knew. And this is a hard thing. It's like. It's hard to talk about this in 30 minutes, right? Because it's. But you're the type of mind, like, I don't. Jim, I don't know that many people like you that are. No, this business from. So many different angles that add that you're talking about bouncing around secures gives you such perspective that others don't have. So would Thursday. Can we just check what does Thursday morning look like? Thursday works. 9am Works for me. Howard, does that work for you?

### You (2025-11-11T14:30:45.870Z)

### Guest (2025-11-11T14:30:46.429Z)
