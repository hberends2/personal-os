# Transcript for: InnVestAI six-month budget planning with Vinod

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:31:08.114Z)

Hello? Hello? How are you? Good. Yourself.

### You (2025-09-05T17:31:15.074Z)

Feel really wiped out today for some reason, I don't know. Just got a lot going on, I guess. How about you? Catching up on your sleep.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:31:25.874Z)

Yep, yep, yep. Sleep is good. Sleep is good. Has Covid? Oh, yeah. He was saving me.

### You (2025-09-05T17:31:32.194Z)

Oh.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:31:37.794Z)

All right, so let's jump into the budget. How do you guys want to tackle this? You want to tackle, like, the six month? Run to the mvp or what are your thoughts on how to go about this? Yeah, we can go six months. And then if we can probably side by side, open what we are expecting to be delivered in six months. Okay. We brought it. That way, we might get a bit better picture whether, you know, we need some resources or what. All right. Okay, so let's see. I know I have the budget since I did it. And Howard used up the roadmap. Did you send it in teams, or did you send it in email?

### You (2025-09-05T17:32:30.674Z)

The roadmap was, I believe, an email with a link.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:32:34.594Z)

Okay, hold on. I'm looking for it. All the CRM stuff, but now I'm back too far. I'm back to eight. So let me see.

### You (2025-09-05T17:33:17.794Z)

I shared it. With everybody. So you may have gotten an email from Microsoft Teams where I shared a document. I also followed up with an email because I know Mark doesn't.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:33:32.754Z)

Right? Right. He doesn't need him. It was this week, though, right? Wednesday. Yep. Okay. Here's the roadmap. Got it. Just one second. To get the other one up to. Okay. You guys probably see the budget, right? At this point. How do I. How do I share? How do I split the screen? Or do you just want to go through this first and then we can talk about the other one? Or should we go through the other one first? Which is here? This right.

### You (2025-09-05T17:34:44.834Z)

Whatever you prefer.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:34:47.794Z)

Well, let's go through this. Probably makes more sense to do this first. So can. Can you guys see it all right? Or do I need to? Yeah, if I would play zoom a little, there would be helpful. Okay, so zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom. Is button on the bottom right where it says 71.

### You (2025-09-05T17:34:54.354Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:35:10.034Z)

Getting there. Give me a second. I have to move my team screen. That's way too much. Way too much. Is that a little. That's still. I think just click on that plus or minus button. So that would go up eventually.

### You (2025-09-05T17:35:31.314Z)

Just to your left.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:35:31.554Z)

In the same. Oh, to my left. Oh, got it. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T17:35:34.994Z)

Yeah. Also, Diane, if you drag that sidebar or see the button for the sidebar up there, up at the top, if you just click on that, make the sidebar go away.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:35:47.634Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T17:35:52.274Z)

That will give you more room on the screen.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:35:54.994Z)

Okay, so you guys should be able to see, right? Poc mvp v1, v11.

### You (2025-09-05T17:36:02.354Z)

Yeah, but the slides down below, starting with slide four, are way easier to read.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:36:09.154Z)

Got it. Slide four. This. Okay? Okay, so I guess we're starting with the poc. Is there any. The only thing I can think of with the POC is that we might need reimbursement for people, right? Because the work's pretty much already been done.

### You (2025-09-05T17:36:27.874Z)

Yeah. Poc is done. There's nothing left. Really? On that.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:36:32.354Z)

Do we have the reimbursements, expenses you guys have paid out of pocket that you need returned to you? So you can think of.

### You (2025-09-05T17:36:42.434Z)

I have not.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:36:45.554Z)

Okay? All right. What about your lovable subscription? Howard.

### You (2025-09-05T17:36:51.954Z)

Yeah, that's about that in my time is really the only expense.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:36:59.154Z)

Okay? Sadly, we don't get our time back. Right. But I think I can reimburse you, or at least include in the budget the lovable. So how much a month do you think that is?

### You (2025-09-05T17:37:03.554Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:37:12.914Z)

It doesn't have to be exact.

### You (2025-09-05T17:37:14.354Z)

That one. I had to increase to 40 to handle the. So, yeah, it's not much, but 40amonth.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:37:18.274Z)

Okay? Okay? All right. Now we move on to slide five, which is the mvp.

### You (2025-09-05T17:37:29.954Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:37:33.234Z)

We're plugging along here. Vinod, when I put in the. Let me just go back and make sure I did this correctly. Give me one second. When I put in. Up here. So I have your two software engineers in for $500 per month at six months. And then I actually, you said the other gentleman's more experienced. He's at 800. Right. But I just put him in. Well, I put him in a. No, wait. He was 400. That was it. Right. For part time. But I just put him in at 800 for full time, assuming we would be able to do that if we got the funding. No, no, he won't come on. 8. He won't come on. Okay. There's, like, too low for him. He likes. Yes. Let's experience. Even for these guys. For Shivam and Raj will eventually have increased it down the line. Okay. But, yeah, for now, at least a couple of months, I think they should be fine. And that also depends on their, you know, work. So they are not even on 500 right now, they're on 400. Okay? Which is pretty low. But, I mean, let's see how they, you know, perform, and then we can discuss that. So this is intended to be for six months, right? So I guess we're gonna just say, say September is probably already gone when it's all said and done. So October, November, December, January, February, March. So 4Q and 1Q. Are you sure you don't want to up that at all? Yeah, I definitely. Want to up that. Okay, well, then let's just do it. So how much do you want for the two junior engineers? What would you like to up that to? I would say close to thousand every month. For each of them, right? Whatever. If we are able to save, right? Right. See if, you know, we can hire someone else as well or add someone else to the team. But I think we should increase that budget overall. Right. Okay, so I just took your 1000. Times six months, times two people. And then that third more senior engineer. What do you want me to plug him in at? For part time right now. I said 600 for him. For four hours or whatever more hours he can give. He works remote, so he can really put in some more hours. Okay. I don't know whether he'll come full time in future, but let's say for after two, three months, probably we can bring him to again thousand, I would say. Okay? I'm just doing this because. I think it's better for some of these things just to. I mean, even if we're slightly overstating it, does this make sense? When we're getting our head around it as a team. And we say 400,000 or 500,000, right? It's, like, enough to cover that we're not paying back for small amounts. Okay, so.

### You (2025-09-05T17:41:05.394Z)

Can you go back to that, Sal? I think you put in 100 instead of 1000.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:41:12.274Z)

I can. Oh, I did. Look at you, Howard. You're so. You catch all the technical mistakes. All right, so there. We've got that. Do you guys, while we're here, want to just talk about the AI People and how you want to do that? Because that's what I have next. So I had assumed 130k, and again, I don't have benefits or anything like that in here, which I don't think we can pay initially. But I had, like, 130k contract annual contract assignment. For the junior product manager, and I took half of that. And then I had 180k for the software engineer that would be more focused on AI, and I took half of that. So Ng, talk about the product manager first, and then we'll talk about software engineering, okay?

### You (2025-09-05T17:42:13.154Z)

Yeah, well, first off, you can't have. Well, it would not do us any good to have a product manager without an engineer. But we could have an engineer without a product manager. Where I could start things out with the AI. And I think for both of these, if they're going to be full time hires, would also have to have some type of equity or Aesop or some skin in the game. Make up for the lack of benefits in the lower pay. So we're going to have to consider that over and above just the paychecks.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:43:00.274Z)

Got it, and I started to work on the cap. Stack tables and then, like, pushing, putting aside, like, just assuming we start with a million shares that's completely just pulled out of thin air, but to put about 15% of that aside for employees. Because we'll have to. I mean, more than you know. It's just more like the first employees will bring on. We'll have to most definitely get shares. So. But again, why don't we just put it in and then I can run a downside scenario. But let me. I'm just going to the bottom for a minute. I'm sorry, I'm babbling, but, like.

### You (2025-09-05T17:43:48.514Z)

Yeah, no, we definitely want to take anything out. I'm just saying, in terms of bringing them on, I don't see bringing on a product manager. In October. Might be a little. But let's go ahead and keep it there.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:44:00.354Z)

Okay? Okay? Are the. And are there the amount good130, or should I bump it to something higher? In fact. Well, Vinod, you sent us something. Well, that was a marketing person, right? That wasn't a. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T17:44:26.674Z)

Let's bump that up to 70.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:44:32.114Z)

70. So another 10k added annually. Right. So that would be. 40.

### You (2025-09-05T17:44:41.074Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:44:41.314Z)

Okay? And then Vinod, what do you want to do with the software engineer? Okay, so this. Do we want to hire someone here in US. Because in that amount, like 180, I can probably, I don't know, higher. So many engineers. Offshore. Yeah, if you can manage. Well, if you and Howard can manage offshore, we're probably much better served to do that. Yeah, because, you know, if we are saying 180 to this engineer, then we are actually paying him more than we are paying ourselves. Right. Right. What we should prioritize first is bringing me full time, bringing Howard full time, because that's really what we need right now. Right. I mean, yeah, it's. I do have down here in the budget. You can see that I have the total with no AI staffing where I took the AI staffing out, although I might not do I have it. Let me just see. 74. Is the total plus contingency? Yes, without the two AI people. So that software engineer 180 budget. I don't know who reached to that number. Did we? Pulled it out of thin air. That is for one engineer or two. I was just thinking one. But you'll have a better son. I mean, both you and Howard. Right? Because it's your team s that have to coordinate on the AI and so the time difference and just, like, that's totally up to you if you guys want to do it domestically or if you want to. Do it overseas. See if. I am here, right? And Howard is here. You know, our team can work from offshore, and we can have overlap, and that's how most of the companies do. I mean, that gives us benefit of, you know, kind of hiring more engineers than hiring so expensive engineers here. And if you are like, you know, hiring one engineer for 180, then I would say we should have budget for ourselves. No. You know, in fact, I was researching that like crazy this morning. Like, I just. Because I just don't understand. I mean, I get the idea that you work for a low salary, but the salaries we're talking about, they're not even their owner draws. They don't have benefits. They don't. Have bonuses that are so low. And I have read that the CTO role commands higher than some of the other Seawolls. And I did read today that something specialized like hospitality niche, which is very complex. You're see, your regular, you know, suite roles would be closer to 150 to 160. But I guarantee you, if I put that in front of Mark, he's gonna balk at it and get. And be like, well, no, we have to all work for free. You know what I mean? So why don't I just do it, though? I don't know. I increase it. So, Vinoda, I'm gonna take you to. I'm gonna 160. For as a placeholder for the six months.

### You (2025-09-05T17:48:17.394Z)

But before we vinod, one of the things we have to realize is that we can't compare salaries as founders. It's not uncommon at all.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:48:18.914Z)

No. Okay.

### You (2025-09-05T17:48:28.914Z)

To have full time employees. That are drawing a higher salary because they get very little equity. If you research it. When you hire somebody into a startup, typically 3 to 5% equity is what I've seen. So we, as founders.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:48:53.394Z)

Percent equity for the founding engineers.

### You (2025-09-05T17:48:59.714Z)

Yeah, you can do that for anybody. But what I'm saying is, if we have to hire an engineer at 180, let's not compare that to what we're making, because we get a much larger slice of the pie. So our reward comes a little later. So let's keep that in mind as we consider the compensation. That's why I'm kind of hesitant to even on the product manager. I think we can get somebody around 140 for a startup, but typically that's going to be 180 to 200 range. If we were had benefits and the other stuff.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:49:53.554Z)

Benefits gross up, like 25 to 30%, and then that's not including bonus, Right? So.

### You (2025-09-05T17:49:59.074Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:50:03.314Z)

I mean, yeah, that's the advantage we get. By having offshore team then here, right? Because one is cost is so high quality is probably similar or little less. But then we are getting, you know that multiplied by many fours.

### You (2025-09-05T17:50:21.474Z)

Yeah, I'm all for off showing that position. Technically, we could even do it with Product Manager.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:50:31.714Z)

Yeah. Probably for now. And then later on in future, you know, we can definitely have.

### You (2025-09-05T17:50:35.554Z)

Yeah. Yeah. In fact, you know what? That just. That just reminded me I've got somebody I can reach out to. That would be offshore. So.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:50:49.554Z)

Okay, well, then. Then let's also just. While I have my cursor here, this is six months, right? So it's not intended to be like the forever amount. It's just intended to be like, get us some investors in the door, like Carlos and Sherben. And so Vinod, I know we talked about, like, 150.

### You (2025-09-05T17:50:58.674Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:51:12.194Z)

For yours. I said it at 125 just for this six months. Just because. To show Mark that. Well, no, we're not, like, claiming what we think. Is sorry. I'm talking and I'm nodding my head. And because I spreadsheet, you guys are probably looking at me like I'm nuts. So that I can show Mark. We'll look. Mark, you know we're not at 150k. And Howard, for you and I, I put us. At 8,500amonth. Which I forget what it. But it's. It's still. Well, I mean, it's like 12,500amonth. I think if you take. Took us to 150. So we're at a. We're at a pretty big discount.

### You (2025-09-05T17:51:58.194Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:51:58.514Z)

Too. And then I have Drew and Mark in there, but I have it accruing versus being paid out current. And then we'll have to add interest to it and pay it out when we get future investors. So, I mean, I feel. Go ahead. No, I'm. Not. 102 node versus 62. Because the 102 is for two of us. It's for Howard and myself. And then the 625 is just for you. If that makes sense, I put you in a different bucket. Yeah. And then we should also consider, like, you know, how much time are we, you know, devoting to this? Because for me and Howard, we are, like, spending probably. If we come full time. I can imagine myself spending so many hours, right. I don't know how much to ruin Mark spending on weekly basis. Right. We are spending. For me, I'm like 100% here day in and day out. Howard has done that when he was doing POC and when he involves more. Obviously, he'll be, you know, working for more than eight hours at least. Yeah, I'm doing that too. You guys might not see it, but behind the scenes, I trying to talk to people about equity and things like that. And I don't know, I think it's just something I think from a person, from a personal perspective, if I'm reading the tea leaves correctly. Drew has this partner in Actus that has him just like, you know, has his feet chained, I guess, as a way, because of. He took about 45k from them, and I don't think they met their revenue goals. And then it's a very draconian agreement. So they now act as if I'm reading it correctly. Pretty much controls what Drew does. I'm not sure if there's gonna want to. Like, we just have to work through that with him. Like, does he. Does he come on board, like, for, like, I don't know how much value is left for him with hotel biz. He just lost one of his biggest clients. Two days ago. Flynn. He said he hasn't signed a new client in a year. That's why he's so hopeful about this Australian client. And then the more I was reading through Drew's, he called it his safe agreement. But he did admit that it had much more. Not his turn. My term, Draconian, you know, terms to it. I was just reading through it, and I was thinking, I don't know, that we might have to totally start over with mapping management companies against each other. Like, I don't think he can take anything from hotel biz. I don't even know if they would consider us buying them. So I'm rambling for a minute, but I do Howard, because I don't know that Mark's doing is nearly as much, even a fraction of the amount of work that you and. Yeah, yeah. And I came like you were saying, that we have to convince Mark it's not just Mark, right? I mean, I don't know. What is his involvement right now? So, I mean, we have to kind of see our situation s as well. It's not just convincing, Mark. Rowit convince investors, right? Is that what you mean? Yes. Right? Yes. And Mark's value will come. It may be in a little bit of a later date because he. Forgive me for using very like girl language here. But he is a Hebro, right in the hotel brokerage capitalist market to deal space. And so we are going to be selling to the hey Bros. And he is one of them. So that's really where his value is going to come, is when he can just pick up the phone and start to call all of his deal guy contacts and help us get our foot in the door on those. Time and dying. Also, once that product is stable, we have built something, then we can have multiple investors. Right? Like, you know, it would be easier, but we need help right now. Mark and pitch in now and help us throw this period. That would be great. Right? Rather than. Yeah. Once our product is good, people can use it. Obviously, we'll have clients and we can have investors. But, I mean, now is the best time to kind of help out.

### You (2025-09-05T17:56:53.554Z)

So, Diane, here's a. Here's a question for you, and it's probably too late. It probably is too late to change, but have we considered Mark to be more of a. Fundraiser and a marketer who maybe should be paid as a percentage of the funds that he raises, kind of like a commission rather than a salary.

### Guest (2025-09-05T17:57:19.314Z)

Yeah, it's too late for that. It is too late for that. I never even thought about that. I mean, Al, honest to God. I mean, I thought Mark would do more on the fundraising side than he has done to date. But I'm hopeful that when, you know, when he. It's like, how do I describe this? Mark and Drew say every week we're getting more and more on the same page. But I feel what's happening is we're just bringing Mark up to speed on the page that everyone else is on. Does that make sense? And then hopefully. But I mean, like, his relationship with Dan Lesser. If Dan Lester would write 100k or 150k check for us. That would be. So I can't even explain how huge that would be, not only in dollars, but in reputational value of what Dan would bring. He knows, like another guy, Glen Alba, who was with Blackstone for a long time. So Mark's contacts are better than my contacts. When it's all said and done, he just hasn't been willing yet to really dip into them. And I think it's because he just. I don't know, maybe he's worried he's gonna feel embarrassed if the product doesn't work. I mean, Howard, you. You've been on enough calls with them as well, too, that you getting a sense of his style. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that. That's. That's what I meant. Right. You have to bet. Now, when we don't have anything. Later. Yeah. Once we are in a good situation, then there can be many people who, you know, will be there to help out. But what would he do, Vinod, other than fundraising and selling? Because he's like me. He's not that technical. Right. And so what would your. What would your view be on that? Yeah. I mean, probably. I mean, what you are doing, right? You already have, like, two investors in place. That's because you are actively kind of working in that direction. And that's what probably we need from Mark as. And I think he will as soon as. I mean, we're gonna have to have some conversations about the mvp, though, because and we've talked about this, but I'm not sure it's completely registering. And Mark's mind that the MVP that we're talking about having. Lang, let's just call at the end of the month or the day he goes to the Phoenix Lodging Conference. They'll be parts of it that are demonstrable, but not the entire thing, because we can't build the entire MVP out by the end of the month. Do I have that? Am I understanding that correctly? Yeah, yeah. Okay? Yeah. So, yeah. So. And then I've got to get Mark comfortable with the safe agreements and the valuation as well. Which I've been studying like mad over the last couple of days, just trying to figure out how to do that. Like how to value a company that has no revenue. I think the predominant method is you just take what your funding is prior to Series A and you say for all of those safe investors, it's 12 to 15% of the value of the company and you gross it up. Then we would need. So it would be like, I think close, close to like a 30 million dollar value or something like that. And we would need to have two and a half to three and a half mil in ARR, two years from now, like when we go to series A to try to make all that math. Come together. Does that make. Does that make sense? And I'm not. I'm not that scared about two and a half to three and a half. And ARR. Especially if we go after big companies, right? Like big lenders, big brokers, stuff like that. But yeah. Well, yeah, I think we have a bit distracted. We can go back. Yeah, I'm sorry. Let's go back to the budget. All right, so we're keeping this all the same, right? The valuation and everything like that. Or not the valuation dm. I'm sorry. My men's distracted to like our compensation. Does this feel okay to you guys for six months?

### You (2025-09-05T18:01:59.474Z)

Yeah. I'm with that, so.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:02:01.474Z)

Okay? All right. Then I will make these changes of moving. The trademark and the pulse and the GoDaddy down a marketing. I was just trying to get it all in one place. But that leaves kind of like all of this, which maybe we now flip back to. It shouldn't be broken up, like, each item. I think we can overall number for the infrastructure instead of, you know, each item. I think that project I should take care of.

### You (2025-09-05T18:02:37.554Z)

Yeah. If you couldn't tell yesterday. That's something I'm really struggling with. I don't. I still don't understand the need to break it up by product. I've never in my life seen it done that way. So. Yeah, just to me, it makes no sense whatsoever.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:02:54.274Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:02:59.954Z)

Because we're building a product. Doesn't matter if it's an MVP or version one or if it's an add on module or anything else. It's InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:03:10.594Z)

Yeah. I think Drew is in a stressed out state of mind just because he's got so much going on and he feels like he needs to put some control. Does this make sense? Like, put some control around it? So let's just lump it together and we'll all just push back that, you know, you guys. Have reviewed it, and investors I'm confident investors don't need to see it at that level because right.

### You (2025-09-05T18:03:36.194Z)

It won't even make sense to them. So, yeah, I'm not sure what control he. Is looking for.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:03:46.834Z)

Where. Where is coming from is that? You guys know my style is very casual in conversational, right? I am not the best person to Howard. Like you're so much more organized than I am when it comes to things like the way you organize our call notes and everything like that. And I think that Drew and Mark feel like the person running those Thursday and Tuesday calls needs to be more ordinarized than my style. And so we're testing out Drew doing it. But what's happened is, at the very same week that we're doing this, Drew's gotten all this bad news, and he's really stressed, and so I just think that. That it was a combination of those things coming together.

### You (2025-09-05T18:04:24.914Z)

Right. Yeah. Well, I get that, but that, to me, doesn't correlate to a budget. And breaking it up the way that he has it broken up. By phase, I mean, because really, that's all these are. These are phases that we're putting a name to.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:04:48.674Z)

Okay, so let's just do it this way and. I'm sorry, I only have probably about another 10 minutes. And we can do this over the weekend to figure guys want to or really early Monday morning. But for this phase. I mean, that's all put into a budget, right? We were talking about. I think we didn't close R1. Do you want to do that real quick? Exactly around this page, or is it someplace else? Am I going to. That was in the actual suit, right? We were saying 90k for a software engineer. Yeah. I think if Howard is good with having offshore engineer, then probably we can reduce that number.

### You (2025-09-05T18:05:27.074Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I'm good with that.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:05:29.394Z)

Okay, so what do we reduce it to? That was for six. Six months, right? So let me.

### You (2025-09-05T18:05:36.274Z)

So before we reduce anything. How many engineers could you get for 90,000 US.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:05:46.514Z)

Do a math real quick.

### You (2025-09-05T18:05:49.714Z)

So that'd be what, 15,000amonth?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:05:55.554Z)

15,000amonth. Depending upon the seniority. Probably. Close to five.

### You (2025-09-05T18:06:06.914Z)

Yeah, that's what I thought.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:06:10.994Z)

Even AI engineer, including AI engineers. And I think that's what we should focus on. One senior person and one AI engineer to start with.

### You (2025-09-05T18:06:22.914Z)

And we're only talking. Well, yeah, we're talking about six months, but we may find ourselves in a position where we have to ramp up quickly. I would rather show 90,000 and not use it than to show 50,000 and not have enough. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:06:42.034Z)

Yes, probably. Then we can update that engineering offshore engineering team budget, probably something like that.

### You (2025-09-05T18:06:48.514Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:06:49.794Z)

This guy up here that was. Or. Where did he go? He was like 10,000 something. Yeah, engineer, right? We had software Engineer. Line number 41. Yeah, 41. Look at you, 40. Oh, this guy. Okay, so you want to update him to what? So we can keep the number same, but then instead of software engineer, we can say engineering team budget. Yeah, optional engineering.

### You (2025-09-05T18:07:15.554Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:07:19.234Z)

And that's in addition to the few software engineers that are in that one line item that we've been breaking out because of this junior engineer. Right? This guy, 37. Or at this point, should I just lump them together? We can club them all, give them separate, either ways. Or we can the new one. We can write like new. Software engineering resources. Something like that if we want to keep them separate. Offshore software engineering resources. Okay, got it. And I should do that. Same with the product manager, right? Just say offshore. Yeah. And in that budget, we can have everything. Like, we can have support team. We can have, you know, one IT person, open, support us from, you know, whatever. And then of course, AI engineer and all full stack engineers. Okay? Okay. And then.

### You (2025-09-05T18:08:33.474Z)

So this might be nitpicking, but Vinod, do we want to say software engineers for support? Because if we're talking to an investor who is very familiar with that, they're going to say, really? You need that much support?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:08:48.514Z)

Yeah. All right. Yeah, I think we can remove support then, because that will be completed.

### You (2025-09-05T18:08:52.034Z)

I would just say, yeah, let's just use the word team.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:09:02.274Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-09-05T18:09:04.834Z)

And maybe even take out the word new. This is for our offshore engineering team. That's what we need.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:09:14.434Z)

Got it. Okay? Perfect. So then what about. Because honestly, then, I don't. This is between you guys, like, all these tools. I completely defer to you. On what you guys need. Like, I don't any of these things. Like, I don't.

### You (2025-09-05T18:09:38.194Z)

So yesterday we saw. Didn't we have separate technical and product group, or was that on Drew?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:09:46.594Z)

That was Drew's schedule. I didn't create a technical. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T18:09:51.554Z)

I updated our InnVestAI tools spreadsheet. And I can just send a copy or even just snap a picture of that.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:10:02.114Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:10:03.314Z)

At least.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:10:04.594Z)

Is that this. This. Right. Which is okay.

### You (2025-09-05T18:10:07.794Z)

Product tools. So, yeah, if you want, I can update that and give you the details, but keep it on one line item. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:10:11.954Z)

Okay? Yeah. And that cloud hosting? Done. I think we need to bump that up. It's just 750 per month. Because we are close to 750. Last one. Okay? So we should make it. How much? 1000amonth or even more than that, because we would be having our AI model and all. 15. I would go. 1500. Yeah, 1500. Okay. And then.

### You (2025-09-05T18:10:41.314Z)

50 with just internal when we opened it up. Extra, I would say it's going to probably at least double.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:10:47.634Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:10:48.274Z)

Probably. I think that's good for six months, but we're going to have to go well higher than 1500amonth.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:10:48.434Z)

So 15. Okay? And that back cloud AI development. I think we can. We don't need to keep that separate because we already have that cloud. Cause just now we updated. This. We can remove all of this. All of these things right here. I can delete gross. 26 through 38 are gone.

### You (2025-09-05T18:11:19.634Z)

Yeah, that's all part of the cloud hosting. So I know. Diane, you have to leave. There was a couple things I thought of. Number one, and it goes in the admin probably is, you know, we're going to adding email seats. As our team grows. Right now, we've used all the free that we've got.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:11:40.114Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:11:40.674Z)

I don't remember how much it was per seat. I think it was like $14 a month each. Not. Here. I'll send you the other stuff, but do you have anywhere in there for professional services?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:11:58.194Z)

I threw in Carrie for 10K. We carried a help with marketing material. And that is? I don't have any. I. Well, let's see. Professional services. I think I've got.

### You (2025-09-05T18:12:11.154Z)

Yeah. Legal in accounting. Okay, those are the two that I was thinking of. And. Just a miscellaneous admin. A miscellaneous regulatory. I would put in some. You know, just like you always have miscellaneous line items in a financial statement.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:12:35.474Z)

So I kind of lumped it all down here.

### You (2025-09-05T18:12:36.114Z)

I know you said. Yeah, I know you had contingency in there.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:12:37.874Z)

With a 20. Yeah. Which is huge. So I feel like 25% contingency. We could get called off. Called on, but that's for, like, well.

### You (2025-09-05T18:12:46.434Z)

That's why I'm wondering if maybe you should split that up into miscellaneous categories and then drop the contingency down to maybe 15 or 10% of that way it doesn't look.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:12:52.994Z)

Got. Makes sense. Yeah. Look so crazy.

### You (2025-09-05T18:13:01.154Z)

Online? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:13:02.674Z)

Yep, that's good. And I threw in something in here for. I know I did. To get started with SoC2. Didn't I do that? I just feel like we have to show that we're at least thinking about it and we're taking the first few baby steps towards. Maybe I didn't.

### You (2025-09-05T18:13:26.274Z)

Yes, but I don't think that we're going to be in a position to do anything in the first six months.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:13:31.954Z)

Okay. All right.

### You (2025-09-05T18:13:32.994Z)

If you might want to leave it in, but just in the notes. Say, you know, that expense will start. Yeah, maybe, you know. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:13:38.994Z)

Starting month seven. Starting. Q2of26 or something like that, okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:13:45.794Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mid-2026 or something like that.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:13:53.154Z)

I have no conferences in here. I mean, I know it may look like I have conferences, but I really have Phoenix. This is just reimbursement of Mark's airfare and hotel. Alice, this isn't the pay for the conference fees. It's just to be a lobby lizard there. Mark feels strong that he wants to present at the in the tech challenge. Drew did it a few years ago, and he doesn't really think it's worth it, so we're going back and forth on that. I threw in this AHLA membership so that we could join that unique identifier ID committee, because I feel like that we could really monetize that in a way we haven't thought about. And then I threw in the 10k for Carrie.

### You (2025-09-05T18:14:37.954Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:14:39.074Z)

But other than that, we're all, like, working from. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-09-05T18:14:41.874Z)

Fifteen minutes. Yeah. No, I was going to say. I've got a call with her in 15 minutes. To go over some of the stuff. So I am not going to share that. Number with her. But at least now I know you know what we've got to work with.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:14:55.554Z)

Right. So I guess that puts us at 500k, basically. I mean, like. Right. That just. That feels like a good even number to say 500k for six months, doesn't it? I mean, it's, like, easy for people to digest. I mean, it's got. I mean, we're probably the biggest. Part of it is our labor. Second biggest part is gonna be the offshore team, their labor.

### You (2025-09-05T18:15:00.194Z)

Basically.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:15:26.834Z)

The tools. And some marketing resources, and that's really about it. Should we also kind of categorize it in a way that, you know, current expenditure and kind of what we expect in future, right? So the new offshore budget we kept, that's for future, not right now. So whatever we are incurring right now and then in future budget, That's good. I'll do that. Yeah. Other thing I notice any of the go. I just wanted to insist if, you know, we can really insist or focus on bringing us full time. There will kind of expedite all the, you know, engineering work, all the product work, and, you know, that's kind of where I would say the major blocker right now. And that slowing us down for sure. Yeah, no, no, I agree. I mean, like, two or three more investors at 50 to 100 to 150k, then I think that solves, like, the problem of, like, bringing you on full time. Right. And then if we can get, you know, Sherben, his agreement wrapped up, and we. And this thing with Carlos. Works out. Then that helps cover some of Howard and Art and my cost, plus some of the ancillary costs. And then I guess, like, another one or two investors, then we start to cover the offshore engineering team costs. And that reminds me of one thing. The company. Which horse? My Visa. Right. They keep 8 20% from any paycheck I get. So even that 125 is gonna go down 20%. So that brings me further. Down. Okay? Okay? Let me add that back in. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T18:17:10.354Z)

Hey, diane. I'm going to put this in the chat. So you can drop. But the trademark, you're going to have to bump that up. I can explain in the chat.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:17:22.594Z)

Okay? Okay, great. Benode. I'm gonna put a 20% markup on yours. Just, I mean, can't hurt. That's gonna take our 500, probably. Culturally, I mean, I don't know what, 520 or something like that. 525. But I'm probably gonna be increasing the trademark, too, but. This was productive. Thank you guys so much. And we'll talk next week.

### You (2025-09-05T18:17:47.314Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:17:48.274Z)

All right. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
