# Transcript for: Clint & Howard Connect

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:06.107Z)

Howard, how's it going?

### You (2025-08-20T14:01:07.227Z)

Hey, Clint, how are you?

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:08.827Z)

Good. It's been a while.

### You (2025-08-20T14:01:10.187Z)

Yeah. He has. Look at you. Got the little podcast setup going on there.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:15.627Z)

Yeah. I've been slowly upgrading the setup, working from home for going on seven years now.

### You (2025-08-20T14:01:21.067Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:22.347Z)

I figured slowly improve. I got to do webcam I just bought so I got to get it set up soon as well.

### You (2025-08-20T14:01:27.307Z)

Nice. So, is all that something you need for your new gig?

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:34.747Z)

No, just personal preference. Want to, you know, present? Well, a lot of it. A lot of what I'm using is holdover from fact. During the pandemic, I was streaming on Twitter with some friends. We were doing. We were opening Pokemon cards and drinking beer on stream.

### You (2025-08-20T14:01:48.107Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:01:54.507Z)

So a lot of it's just hold over stuff from that that I finally got set up for my work purposes because I'm not using it for that anymore.

### You (2025-08-20T14:02:04.187Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:02:05.627Z)

So how's everything on your end?

### You (2025-08-20T14:02:08.987Z)

Interesting. Yeah, it's going pretty well.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:02:10.267Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:02:14.827Z)

I'm sure. I don't know if you got the news with red IQ and everything. That from Ben. I'm sure you did. But yeah. Starting a new gig. That has got some good traction.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:02:35.067Z)

Is it something you're doing yourself or are you going to work for somewhere or what?

### You (2025-08-20T14:02:38.107Z)

No, actually, there's actually five of us who are working on it.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:02:41.147Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-20T14:02:46.667Z)

But it's very interesting in that I've been talking to Diane, who is kind of the spirit heading this whole thing. She has been a consultant. In the hospital ity space for over 30 years. And a couple years ago. She was introduced to me by a team at Berkadia They had just opened up a hospitality office. And so they wanted to see what red IQ could do to help. And when we were talking, she had made the comment. That there's nothing at all like this in the hospitality space. And I called bullshit. There's no way that.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:03:42.347Z)

Well, and hospitality. You have star reports and stuff. You don't have traditional rent rolls and operating statements. Are pretty similar across the board. There's some nuances between them, but they're standardized. So I could see they're not really being much in that space because historically there hasn't been a need. A lot of our family owned shops. A lot of Patels, which is not stereotypical, just. It's the truth.

### You (2025-08-20T14:04:09.067Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:04:10.187Z)

I worked in hotels before I got multifamily. And so short. Stand at Marks and Knowledge app as an intern for six months and kind of cut my teeth. Doing hotels before moving into multi, which kind of kicked off my career trajectory. But yeah. It's a little different space than multifamily, that's for sure.

### You (2025-08-20T14:04:30.907Z)

It is. It is. And so when everything went down at Raddix, for all intents and purposes, basically shuttered Grid iq. She reached out again. And this I'm like, okay, yeah, we can talk. And I did some research. And yeah, she was right. There is nothing like it there. But it's not so much about the underwriting because, yeah, you're right. Everybody uses Excel. It's very standardized. But one of the five partners already has a hotel asset management reporting tool, and he's got some big clients. We're going to merge them. We've talked to some other third party data providers and basically we're able to do what I wanted to do at Red IQ but couldn't because of Berkadia contracts with COSTAR and some of the other ones. We couldn't get our hands on the data, so this one is wide open. We do have. In fact, CBRE has committed to providing us with some analysts to kick the tires. And we've got a couple other people. We're still technically pre seed. And haven't really gotten anything yet, but I put together a proof of concept using lovable.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:06:03.227Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:06:09.147Z)

Know, good old no code tools. But now we've got a team. We've got three developers in India right now.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:06:11.627Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-08-20T14:06:17.707Z)

That are putting together the actual mvp. And once we get that and we can get in front of some people, we expect to get some investment activity going on there. So, yeah, it's been interesting. Putting that together.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:06:33.387Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:06:35.227Z)

How about.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:06:35.307Z)

Who at CB are you working with?

### You (2025-08-20T14:06:38.907Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:06:39.947Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-20T14:06:42.347Z)

So. I told you, Diane has been a consultant. Or is a consultant now, but she's worked with all the major companies out there. In a lot of different underwriting, investment consulting, paperwork, site management. One of the other partners was head of. Hospitality, I believe, at Cushman Wakefield. And then he left to start his own brokerage. And then he's also been developing. So right now, he's independent. But again, since he both of those people know everybody in the industry, So, yeah, we've had some very good conversations with prospective users, prospective investors, overwhelmingly positive response. But I'm just focusing on creating the tool. They're out there knocking on doors and calling in favors, so I don't know. I don't know names yet. I imagine I'm going to learn them soon.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:07:58.827Z)

What's the end goal?

### You (2025-08-20T14:08:02.107Z)

The end goal is to basically be the primary. Tool for underwriting. In fact, we're actually going after the loan underwriting and loan servicing. First because they tend to underwrite at a very high level. They don't get into the minutia of the food and beverage and all those other line items. And then, like I said, one of our other partners already has an asset management. Tool that will integrate, so we'll be looking at cradle to grave asset management as well. And then once we build out the tool and get down into more granularity, we'll go for the brokers and investors. But the end goal is we could have a marketplace like we were in the process of developing it, right? IQ the data will. Be abundant, let's put it that way.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:09:03.387Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:09:06.747Z)

I learned some things about CoStar that I didn't know, at least in the hospitality space.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:09:15.067Z)

Well that they. They brought in all the str data. Last year, whenever that was.

### You (2025-08-20T14:09:20.667Z)

They do. But if I'm an investor and I want to get the STR report to the full report package, It takes them anywhere from one to four days, costs a few thousand dollars and you get a PDF back.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:09:37.707Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:09:37.707Z)

And there's no reason why. We can't provide something like that in basic, basically real time. Because as part of the package, The data that they collect for the STI report is basic.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:09:46.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:09:49.787Z)

Data. So. We've even discussed giving incentives to their contacts to say, hey, whenever you push your data into Star report, send us a copy. Take the same thing.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:10:06.267Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:10:08.507Z)

So. Pretty ambitious, David, going after Goliath. But I don't think they'll even notice. Hospitality is such a drop in the bucket to them.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:10:12.027Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:10:22.507Z)

So how about yourself? I was surprised to hear that you moved on from jll.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:10:29.787Z)

It's good. Almost 10 year run.

### You (2025-08-20T14:10:31.227Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:10:33.067Z)

But I started on the business side over there. In 2016, doing as an analyst on the multicam family side, doing this myself. And I was a heavy user. Red IQ in the company kind of got shifted over to the tech side in late 2019 to own Red IQ for JLo, and then moved into more of a formal product management role. Building some internal applications and things. But in that kind of Lou from owning redIQ before moving into product management. I was part of our capital markets innovation team for about a year. Which we were basically gatekeepers. So a lot of what we did was look at new technology out there. We work with JLSpark, which was JL's BC fund, with JLL's M&A team and some others to identify business use cases for investments they were looking at making.

### You (2025-08-20T14:11:18.747Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:11:27.467Z)

But then also, never analyst or brokers or whoever would say, hey, let's look at this new technology. We would vet it and check it out before and help with. Help with contracts and all that stuff. And through that process, there's a lot of overlap with technology between the investment, sales, and debt world that I was focused on. And our valuations team. And so Brendan Nunnick, who was one of the heads of the jail evaluation group, We connected. And we would meet monthly, generally just to stay abreast of kind of what's going on technology wise, across the org. And all that. Well, in 2022, Brandon and his business partner, Eric Enlow, they parted ways with jll. And he called me and was like, hey. Kind of jokingly, I thought. But he was like, hey, you know, we're out of here. Just want to stay in touch. And in a couple years, when we're ready to bring on, actually build out our tech org, you're my first call. And I was like, yeah, sure, sounds great, Brand. On. Fast forward to last fall. I was in Chicago for some meetings, and I reached out to Brandon. I was like, hey, let's grab lunch. Let's catch up. And he's like, perfect timing. And I was like, okay. So we called up and he kind of pitched this Director of product, head of product role for PBA, which it's about 100person.org. That sits within its parent company partner Engineering and Science. Which is about a 1500 person org. And so some back and forth wanted to have something done by the end of last year, but the can kind of kick down the road. They had some internal stuff they were dealing with. And so finally he reached back out kind of mid to late June and was like, hey, let's do this. And made a compelling offer. For me. It felt like it was time to make a change after 10 years of JLL. And kind of being just stuck in that will such a big company. I mean, it's 100,000 person org globally. And to get anything done, it's like pulling teeth. You're having to put together five slide decks and pitch to 10 different people to get a $30,000 expensive. And it's like you can't work efficiently, you can't be agile.

### You (2025-08-20T14:13:39.947Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:13:41.707Z)

So coming over to partner. I'm in week five right now. And a lot of what it's been has been where administrative getting up to speed on their current workflows, understanding this behemoth of an Excel model they have. Kind of meeting. The dev team that manages that. And then taking over a lot of the vendor relationships from Brandon, who's the owner of the company. And then moving forward. I'm actually in Chicago next week. We're meeting just in person, kind of planning out Q4, going the next year. Kind of aligning on tech initiatives. But I think the rest of this year is we're focused on getting organized. Kind of with what we currently have. And path kind of a plan forward. And then next year, start actually trying to build some cool things. I've been using lovable to do some mockups of some AI qaqc tool. For our reports, basically as an intermediary between the appraiser finishing the report, sending it to the reviewer to review before it goes to the client.

### You (2025-08-20T14:14:39.627Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:14:46.747Z)

Having a quick qaqc check using AI to catch any red flags. That they can fix to save some of the back and forth. Like little small things like that, because in our business, in the valuation side, Minutes matter. It's a very high volume, low margin business.

### You (2025-08-20T14:15:01.227Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:15:05.227Z)

Where in the capital markets world that I'm used to. We're doing 10 to 12 transactions a year, but they're 250 to $500,000 commission deals. So you have a little more time to be thorough and stuff. Where? Evaluations. It's like you need to be thorough, but you also have two weeks to turn something around.

### You (2025-08-20T14:15:22.507Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:15:25.867Z)

Working on how do we shave minutes off and over time have that add up to some substantial amount? So that's the real focus of leveraging tech to empower our team. It's anywhere from 15 to 20 hours of time at the desk actually doing the valuation. Obviously, we can find streamlined methods for the inspectors and things like that as well, on site, where they're taking pictures and doing stuff. But we're like, okay, we're spending 18 hours on average. On an appraisal. How do we shade that down to 12 hours or 8 hours? Trying to find those efficiencies.

### You (2025-08-20T14:16:02.427Z)

Cool. So is that basically the business model, is basically an appraisal firm, or is that just. Okay, all right.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:16:10.107Z)

Yeah. Yeah, it's an appraisal firm. We have about 70 appraisers. And I was just brought in to kind of run technology for the org. Find ways to streamline using my existing domain knowledge, plus my knowledge of an understanding of kind of what's out there, vendor relationships, all that.

### You (2025-08-20T14:16:32.427Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:16:35.067Z)

To find efficiencies where the appraisers at the end of the day, that's the core business. If our appraisals are doing 400k in revenue ahead on average. How do we get that to 500k ahead or 600k ahead? There's only so many hours in a year, so you can't drive more business with the current process. Es you need to find ways to trim time off, which then, in theory, will give you that much more flexibility to go drive new revenue.

### You (2025-08-20T14:17:04.827Z)

Yeah, I think we need to stay in touch because I think we've got a lot of complimentary projects. And we're not competitors.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:17:13.787Z)

Yeah, well. And the hotel tool? We do some hotel business. I don't know the Berkadia I know that a large portion of our annual business is in the manufactured housing space.

### You (2025-08-20T14:17:17.867Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:17:29.307Z)

They've just kind of built a brand around that, and that's kind of what they pulled the manufacturing housing team from jll. Probably half the people at Partner partner valuations are XJLL people. So a lot of familiar names for me coming over and some of the devs and stuff I've worked with in the past at jll. They were kind of contract devs at jll, but now they're employees here. And so MHC is a big portion. That plus just multifamily in general. Are kind of really big segments, and then we have a pretty big commercial business. I don't know what our hotel volume is, but I know that we've integrated the costar, STL reports and some other stuff in there.

### You (2025-08-20T14:18:15.867Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:18:17.787Z)

But there's actually something. I was trying to look it up over on the call. Give me one second. I know that. Back in my days at Market. So the reason I ask who? It's cb, the team I work for at Marcus. They're at CB now, and they lead the South Central. Hotel group or cb. And. They had an application. Looks like it's still. They're still running it. I don't know if it's, say, kept a date. It's a company called yb intel. It looks like it's kind of changed slightly. What they used to do, they used to. They basically pull in the hotel and alcohol revenue and occupancy tax from the state website, which you can then translate kind of back, reverse engineer it to get ADR and all that. So as an analyst on their team, I was basically pulling in every month. I'd have to go request the report. It's this massive just CSV file, that gift of parse. It's all historical. Sales maximacy tax basically.

### You (2025-08-20T14:19:35.707Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:19:36.267Z)

And then from that, based on flat percentages in the state, you could back into the value. I know that maybe text is specific, we only focus on taxes, but yeah, that's something out there too. That again, it kind of gets you to the same place of the STR report, but it's free. With the exception of just a little bit of effort. But with AI parsing that and figuring it out. Should be relatively simple.

### You (2025-08-20T14:20:03.787Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What. What we're looking to do on the AI side, we've already done some proof of concept. Is market research. And one of the tests that I ran was back when I was in Real with with Real Page. I had an office in Costa Mesa, and there was a boutique hotel out there. To stay at all the time. And so we put together just a pretty. I mean, just really basic prompt. But using deep learning.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:20:43.627Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-08-20T14:20:43.947Z)

And asked bring up tax information, prior sales history, a bunch of different things, and in a few minutes. And it was amazing. Ly accurate. And it's like, wow, okay, Just think of what we could do if we actually put together a better prompt.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:21:04.747Z)

Are you familiar with?

### You (2025-08-20T14:21:06.267Z)

To do.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:21:07.387Z)

Are you familiar with? Hello, Data.

### You (2025-08-20T14:21:09.947Z)

I've heard of it, yes.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:21:12.507Z)

So it's a group of three guys they just sold to Grace Hill a few months ago, but they were bootstrapped. It's a. Mark Rutzen is my main guy with that I talk to. He built a noto originally. There's the same three guys that built a Noto sold to Walker, Dunlop. They built hello Data, which is essentially.

### You (2025-08-20T14:21:27.707Z)

Okay? Okay? Yeah, that's how I heard of it at Red iq, I think. Ben.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:21:35.867Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:21:36.987Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:21:37.787Z)

So they're basically scraping the web for real time rents. They're scraping property websites for all public available information. And because of the lawsuit against Real Page and Guardian co star and stuff for kind of market manipulation, we want to call it. That kind of springboarded. Hello, Data. A lot faster. There's also Apartment IQ, which is doing the same thing. Very similar. And we're actually looking at both of them as potential vendors. But they're doing it strictly for multifamily. But that's also something you could replicate. What they're doing but for hotels. Because you have all the listing sites. You can literally just scrape Google Hotels or Expedia if you wanted to. Instead of going to go to individual property sites. But you scrape the data, you put together kind of a historical thing with trends. And have. You could do a similar thing. To come up with guesstimations that are very accurate for actual rates and historical rates and everything. Doing something similar.

### You (2025-08-20T14:22:52.827Z)

That's very interesting. So are you back in Houston now, you still don't.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:22:58.267Z)

No, I'm still. Still abroad. I'm back and forth. I mean, Houston's home. But still in Guyana. Probably be here. We're here through February at a minimum. My wife. She's working on a. Jess. Her actual job as an engineer or engineering manager, but then she's working on a big project that ends in February, so we're here through that.

### You (2025-08-20T14:23:22.987Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:23:23.307Z)

And then. Most likely we'll be here another year and a half or two years. She'll probably do a second assignment here. Which we kind of budgeted for or so years down here. We just hit two years this month. We're enjoying it. Still getting. We're back stateside pretty often. Like I said, I'm in Chicago next week. And then we're actually going on vacation the first week of September, going to Peru for a week. But, yeah, it's good. We're back every four to six weeks for a week or so, generally.

### You (2025-08-20T14:24:01.627Z)

My youngest just moved out of the house a few weeks ago, and we knew this was going to happen.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:24:05.227Z)

Nice.

### You (2025-08-20T14:24:09.627Z)

But I've got my eyes on Belize. I've heard some interesting things about that.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:24:12.667Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-20T14:24:15.947Z)

One of these days. Hopefully sometime before the end of this year. I can't do it now without any revenue.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:24:19.867Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:24:21.547Z)

But going to head down there and check it out. I don't know. I think it'd be nice either. It wouldn't be a full time brew, but it'd be.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:24:32.507Z)

Yeah, I have some. A friend of mine, his Berends Two years ago, they were tired to Belize.

### You (2025-08-20T14:24:38.987Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:24:40.267Z)

And they don't have like Ben's house in Costa Rica. It's not some fancy big thing, but you know, they're living in a. They have a nice little three bedroom house close to the water kind of in town. That it's walkable. Most everybody there speaks English. It's very expat. Very expat. Friendly, so.

### You (2025-08-20T14:25:00.667Z)

Yeah. They were an English colony up until like, eight, 1980s something, I think it was. So, yeah, English is the official language.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:25:11.467Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:25:13.147Z)

That's a big thing for me. I tried learning language and I just could not do it.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:25:18.747Z)

Yeah. So my. My wife is dominican, and we've been together just over 10 years.

### You (2025-08-20T14:25:22.427Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:25:26.667Z)

Kind of on and off and been married for almost three. But I don't know, like a Spanish. And so my mother. My mother in law doesn't really speak English.

### You (2025-08-20T14:25:36.347Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:25:36.987Z)

And, you know, my wife's a native Spanish speaker, but learning English as a kid, and then, you know, she's bilingual now. Her whole family, they're all bilingual except for her mom. And I'm just kind of, like. I kind of nod and say, yeah, you know, see, like, whatever. But I was hoping.

### You (2025-08-20T14:25:51.627Z)

Those surveys, that's all you need.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:25:54.347Z)

Dante style, Elbano, you know? I was without moving to Guyana. I was excited. I was like, oh, should I learn Spanish? Did not realize it was a British colony. That's. It's an English speaking country now. It's like a Creole English. It's very, you know, kind of blended. But yeah. I was like, dang. So I'm actually looking for Spanish lessons here. There's a pretty large Dominican community. Venezuelan, Cuban, Colombia. There's a lot of kind of Latin community here. So I'm trying to find a Spanish teacher that I can do private lessons with. To really get up to speed on it. Because my nieces and nephews, they're all growing up bilingual.

### You (2025-08-20T14:26:36.667Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:26:36.667Z)

And my niece is 7 and show intentionally speak Spanish and make fun of me to my face because she knows I don't understand her. I'm like, okay.

### You (2025-08-20T14:26:45.867Z)

Just smile, Smile and nod.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:26:49.947Z)

But.

### You (2025-08-20T14:26:51.387Z)

I know I'm being lazy, but I figured there's so many translation tools out there right now. They already have the ear buds.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:27:02.507Z)

I get the meta glasses? They have live translation.

### You (2025-08-20T14:27:04.827Z)

Do they? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:27:06.187Z)

Yeah. So I've been using these. I haven't used that feature yet, but I use them. These are my like daily sunglasses now because just for listening to music, I go on a walks or something, listen to music without having actual earbuds in. So it's a little safer with some of the crazy drivers. Here. Take video, take photos. You can take phone calls with it. You can ask AI questions.

### You (2025-08-20T14:27:28.107Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:27:30.267Z)

They're fun little gimmick.

### You (2025-08-20T14:27:31.307Z)

Yeah, I've got. What is it? The shocks aeroplex. The. The bone conduction we then use when I'm biking.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:27:37.067Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:27:41.787Z)

But yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:27:44.347Z)

I got these as they're kind of a gimmick. My old pair of Wayfarers was kind of on their last leg, and I was looking at a pair of polarized wayfarers. It's like $250, $240. These were 300. I'm like, I'll pay $60 for the. Get it back, and it's cool. It's nice. It's kind of replaced by AirPods for kind of being outdoors or doing stuff.

### You (2025-08-20T14:28:07.787Z)

No, that's. That's pretty cool. Well, cool.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:28:09.787Z)

Anyways. Well, great catching up. Keep me posted on how things progress. And once you have kind of a working prototype of kind of what you're trying to sell, I'd love to see it.

### You (2025-08-20T14:28:11.547Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:28:21.067Z)

Because, like I said, I don't know exactly what percentage of our business is hotels, but we do hotels. So there could be. Broadway's looking for new data sources. That can help empower our teams.

### You (2025-08-20T14:28:31.867Z)

Yeah, yeah. No, I'd be glad to show. Actually expecting. We were hoping by the week after Labor Day, but we're probably gonna be at more like the second or third week.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:28:41.707Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-20T14:28:45.707Z)

Realistically. Trying to get that. But yeah, same thing. I'd be interested to learn more about what you're accomplishing with AI. I think that just using error catching, I think, is a great start.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:29:01.867Z)

Yeah, small things. We're working with some third party AI developers that are building a couple of applications for us. One's an OM ripper. So basically we get oms from different clients or whoever that we can throw it in there and they'll pull out property information if there's a rent roll or operating statement. They'll rip that out. And so those are in development. Rent comp tool. That's basically leveraging the data sources we're paying for. But saving our team from having to go to four different sources. It's basically saying, hey, we're pulling the information from these. We're putting together the best comp set, and it has a score that's giving it. So they can type in a property. This is multifamily only right now, but they can type it in address. And it'll pull in the top five comparables. And give it a confidence score and all that. And then it'll tell you if it's from Axio or Rope Page or Costar or Yardy or whatever the data is actually from. And so it kind of mix and matches depending on the property, depending on the unit mix. But that way they can kind of do a one shot pull comps rather than having to go to four different sources. Using AI for a lot of little small things. Then also using it for writing a lot of the narratives and kind of the administrative stuff that no one wants to do. They're copying and pasting from Wikipedia or Google anyways.

### You (2025-08-20T14:30:21.787Z)

Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:30:28.587Z)

So? So why not have AI take a shit, take a stab at it?

### You (2025-08-20T14:30:31.147Z)

Yeah, that's one of the, what I would consider the low hanging fruit that we're, we're going to be doing. We're also using AI primarily for extracting the financial data where, you know, Q was a rules engine and any minor change would trip it up. So we're looking to AI for that, but I would like to. You know, maybe we can keep in touch on the Om side. I have somebody that I worked with that developed a tool. He's doing multifamily evaluation as well. But his Basically you just take a screenshot of the financials and upload it and it'll extract it just like it would anything else. Didn't do anything else but. I would love to be able to extract pretty much everything from the om, even the broker description. You could bring that in and put it into the model. And then my goal, one of my goals also is I want to be able to push a button, get a full investment package. That they can go to the market.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:31:39.947Z)

So that's something that. Are you familiar with Love capital? Or lev, I think now they're based in new york. Lev.

### You (2025-08-20T14:31:47.947Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:31:49.147Z)

So James Acres, who used to be the product team at Red iq way back in the day, he went to Lev for a while. They've kind of pivoted four or five times. And their kind of life cycle as a product. But now they're focused on smaller debt shops. Basically as a full end to end tool where they operate as a dill room. And then you can generate an OM essentially using AI from whatever data in there it's auto generating. Text and market research and everything. You can drop in photos, your model, and it'll pull in different sections of it. That's a really cool product that they've built out.

### You (2025-08-20T14:32:32.427Z)

Yeah. All right. Well, good catching up with you. Glad to hear things going well.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:32:39.947Z)

We'll stay in touch. Let's connect sometime. Maybe a month from now. One hour show and tell and take a look at it.

### You (2025-08-20T14:32:50.987Z)

Yeah, we can surely do that. I know. We've got our connection on LinkedIn. Here. I'll just drop. My email in the chat here.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:33:05.467Z)

I have it from when I sent the invite over, I think.

### You (2025-08-20T14:33:09.387Z)

Did I give you my work email? The new one.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:33:13.867Z)

InnVestAI. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-20T14:33:14.507Z)

Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:33:20.027Z)

Awesome. We'll stay in touch, and it's great catching up.

### You (2025-08-20T14:33:22.427Z)

All right. Take care.

### Guest (2025-08-20T14:33:23.787Z)

All right. Thanks, Howard. Bye.
