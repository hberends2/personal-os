### Guest (2025-06-09T18:32:29.093Z)

anyone to get in any kind of trouble, especially you. Does that make sense? So I wasn't sure when I read that part of the response, what that meant.

We have to do with the weekend, do it.

### You (2025-06-09T18:36:41.386Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:36:42.743Z)

H one p, but I don't know whether let's say, you need to have h one b this one. But

### You (2025-06-09T18:36:42.806Z)

I don't know whether let's say, you need to have a company that's fine, but I I don't think we are asking a question whether our company can do it.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:36:49.423Z)

I I don't think we asked him a question whether our company can do h

### You (2025-06-09T18:36:51.956Z)

It and be right now. He did say that

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:36:53.373Z)

right now. He did say that

### You (2025-06-09T18:36:53.816Z)

we should do H and B.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:36:55.583Z)

we should do H and B.

### You (2025-06-09T18:36:56.346Z)

But we're you know, before for

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:36:57.763Z)

But whether you know, before

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:00.356Z)

the company or if not, it's on the company or if don't have any or anything,

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:00.753Z)

forming the company or even after forming the company when we don't have funding or anything,

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:04.266Z)

So we

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:05.723Z)

we would be in a position to do h and p.

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:05.726Z)

would be a voice in the bullet and b. Once we are in in place, then we can always do that. So take enough

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:08.933Z)

Once we are in position, we can always do that. So I can have two visas.

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:12.686Z)

Okay. That's

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:13.393Z)

Okay. That's that's what we'll have to do eventually.

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:15.966Z)

that's what we have to do eventually. Okay. But right now, I don't think we have no question to do action b.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:19.893Z)

Okay. But right now, I don't think we are in a position to do H and P.

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:22.896Z)

Okay. And he's also saying, if I'm reading this correctly, it doesn't really matter

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:23.673Z)

Okay. And he's also saying, if I'm reading this correctly, it doesn't really matter if we incorporate

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:28.046Z)

what corporate and Delaware

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:29.813Z)

in Delaware or we incorporate anywhere or, like, the structure itself

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:30.336Z)

anywhere. Like, the structure itself doesn't impact, right, the

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:33.973Z)

doesn't impact, right, the

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:36.556Z)

the ability for your

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:37.903Z)

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:43.986Z)

Okay. We can do LLC.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:45.393Z)

Okay. We can do LLC or corporation. I think that

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:48.226Z)

Corporation. I don't think that has an impact as far as it's going get these concern.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:37:51.083Z)

has any impact as far as it's for EAD is concerned.

### You (2025-06-09T18:37:53.456Z)

other questions too, but we can just see

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:39:28.193Z)

### You (2025-06-09T18:39:30.506Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-09T18:39:48.246Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:40:01.213Z)

Well, let me take care of that. And then probably

### You (2025-06-09T18:40:02.076Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:40:47.363Z)

I mean, that's how I was imagining then.

### You (2025-06-09T18:40:48.676Z)

them. You know, internalize

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:40:50.433Z)

You know? Instead of my name, we just replace the name

### You (2025-06-09T18:40:51.556Z)

we just replace the name. We continue working.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:40:53.903Z)

and we continue working That's probably the simplest.

### You (2025-06-09T18:40:56.556Z)

This. Progress and test.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:40:59.703Z)

Okay. But we all have to kind of agree on that. But we can directly

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:04.146Z)

Kind of talk to that on here and get this on clear. I don't think we can put this in any

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:05.153Z)

kind of talk to that on me and get this all cleared. I don't think we can put this in an email that, you know, it will be her name, and then I'll be working doing coding.

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:14.306Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:14.813Z)

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:15.226Z)

We don't fit all on that. Right? Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:19.293Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:33.446Z)

profit. Product. For owners that is saying it's two way One, that it such direct competition for Drew.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:41.273Z)

data services.

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:49.196Z)

And so I I mean, I could be wrong, but I think that may

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:50.593Z)

So I I mean, I could be wrong, but I think that may

### You (2025-06-09T18:41:53.926Z)

they result in him being

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:41:55.343Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:04.083Z)

that just his line of

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:04.586Z)

of asset management. Management. Data.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:06.093Z)

of asset management data providing, you know, part of that has just

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:06.726Z)

To provide. Know, part of that has just gotten more competitive.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:10.613Z)

gotten more competitive. But then second, if for whatever reason things don't work

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:10.966Z)

But there's second, for whatever reason, things don't work out with Drew,

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:15.223Z)

out with Drew,

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:15.266Z)

they could be data provider for us.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:16.233Z)

they could be data provider for us.

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:17.896Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:28.413Z)

So that was a big announcement. It's pretty

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:30.136Z)

huge for the industry that she's entered into that.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:31.883Z)

huge for the industry that she's entering into that.

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:33.536Z)

But I I think it could be positive for us either way.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:35.223Z)

But I I think it could be positive for us either way.

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:37.196Z)

But it does show that every single

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:43.083Z)

But it does show that every single competitor that's entering this

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:44.416Z)

competitor that's entering this space in the hospitality

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:47.513Z)

space in the hospitality side is entering it through asset management and not

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:47.796Z)

side. Is entering it through asset management and not capital markets. Right. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:54.803Z)

capital markets.

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:55.046Z)

So we

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:42:56.163Z)

Right? So we there's one group I can think of that could

### You (2025-06-09T18:42:56.466Z)

there's one that it could possibly come out with the capital markets

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:43:00.593Z)

possibly come out with a capital markets product. But so far, we're the

### You (2025-06-09T18:43:01.136Z)

problem. And so far, we're the only one that's truly targeted at capital markets.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:43:04.963Z)

only one that's truly targeted capital markets.

### You (2025-06-09T18:43:08.116Z)

### You (2025-06-09T18:44:27.386Z)

CVS is great in Calorie Labs,

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:44:29.143Z)

Cindy S. Green and Calibri Labs who made that announcement

### You (2025-06-09T18:44:29.706Z)

We have an announcement when she started the business, probably

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:44:32.793Z)

when she started in this business probably ten years ago. She had

### You (2025-06-09T18:44:33.396Z)

years ago. Ago, she had someone similar to them. That

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:44:36.203Z)

someone similar to Kevin that

### You (2025-06-09T18:44:37.306Z)

acted almost as Howard in evangelist. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-09T18:44:50.016Z)

And Mark has

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:44:52.033Z)

### You (2025-06-09T18:54:27.796Z)

say,

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:54:27.853Z)

segment. It's it it it there's a road path on the other commercial property types

### You (2025-06-09T18:54:49.046Z)

So I believe we can buy a few

like, listen to everyone's say,

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:57:38.773Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-09T18:57:55.506Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:58:16.513Z)

That's it. Right?

### You (2025-06-09T18:58:17.566Z)

But I'm I'm I'm gonna post a video of the more recent updates to where we are right now. So I am all the way down to total revenue. Right? So I've got the room's revenue, added the food and beverage,

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T18:58:49.396Z)

all those other things over the weekend. To get down into the details. Once we've got that, obviously, you have to do the expenses. Which from what I've seen is probably a little bit easier. When I talk about food and beverage, I'm just talking about food and beverage. Right? I'm not getting down

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:59:06.243Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T18:59:08.536Z)

those different classifications for any of those groups.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:59:10.273Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T18:59:13.236Z)

So when we go up against an Excel model, you know, we want to make sure it's apples to apples. And, you know, if somebody comes in and says, oh, I need to go and do all this little minutiae on these line items, We're gonna be there.

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:59:27.093Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T18:59:27.686Z)

We're gonna be there quickly. We've already designed for it. I just haven't put it in the model because I don't wanna add a bunch of complexity before we start getting used for feedback. So I think we will probably be within, you know, maybe a week or two. Of having that very rough proof of concept. To put together. Somebody can go ahead and actually start

### Guest (2025-06-09T18:59:50.373Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T18:59:54.146Z)

inputting numbers. To get a to get an output and and to compare it to Excel. Are we gonna have a full blown summary page and all other stuff? No. But we can get the

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:00:09.023Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:00:11.526Z)

the most critical metrics to match up. Okay? ROI, cash on cash. I mean, all those different Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:00:18.973Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:00:19.156Z)

Items there. It which reminds me, I still need to also the expenses, probably go with the financing. So we can get there.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:00:28.133Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:00:28.736Z)

And You know, right now, in order to to to forecast the revenue, there's only two inputs. That that that the user needs to do. And that's, you know, the occupancy and the ADR.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:00:44.953Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:00:45.876Z)

And by by manipulating those, you know, they can control their revenue. And then for each light line item that they have for other operated, same thing. You just put in what that department ADR is, multi multiplies it times the number of occupied rooms. Boom. You got your number. Mhmm. So it's very fast.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:01:09.773Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:01:12.346Z)

And what I love about it. And I I did create over the weekend the point where you don't have to scroll on this page to get to where you want. Maybe scroll past and go back. You know, I I have the navigation pane now where if I wanted to click on the ADR, it takes me right to our the ADR. I have a food and beverage, know, so it takes you

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:01:32.093Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:01:35.296Z)

right directly where you wanna go. So really, I I you know, we are definitely past the midpoint. But we still have a few items to go there.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:01:43.363Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:01:47.496Z)

Then we get in front of the committee. And all I mean, anybody and everybody that we can get in there and start looking at it. And everybody's gonna have an opinion on how the sidebar should be have an opinion. They don't like this color. Mhmm. You know?

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:02:03.663Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:02:04.996Z)

Get all sorts of stuff like that. But the bottom line is is, you know, we we need to just have confirmation that the numbers aren't right. Not gonna worry about colors and fonts and where this is. As long as we can get

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:02:20.003Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:02:21.556Z)

that done, then we will be able to sit down in front of the money people, whether it be angel investors. I know couple weeks ago, you mentioned about a potential meeting with CBRE.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:02:34.113Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:02:34.236Z)

I don't know if that's still an option. It did. Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:02:37.313Z)

It is. Yep.

### You (2025-06-09T19:02:37.516Z)

Brecadia has the same type of incubator with their be engaged program. So I mean, lot there there's some vendors in the BeEngage program that I know are part of other incubators, so it's not like an exclusive. I don't know how CBRE works. But They're not

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:02:55.653Z)

They're not exclusive either.

### You (2025-06-09T19:02:56.416Z)

exclusive either. Yeah. I mean, I feel like think we could be with another book. It would actually

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:00.373Z)

I mean, I like, I think they could be with another broke it would it actually would probably be better to have

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:01.166Z)

book. Be better to have two brokers and incubator. Because then it doesn't seem like

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:05.343Z)

two brokers in the incubator because then it doesn't seem like one broker has

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:06.196Z)

one broker has this big advantage over another Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:09.923Z)

this big advantage over another broker.

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:12.206Z)

Yeah. Giving up part of the competition. Yeah. I mean that that's that's the that's how the game is played.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:15.453Z)

Yeah. But we're giving up we're gonna be giving up part of the company to to do that. Right?

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:19.856Z)

You know? If you don't wanna give up any control, then we have to bootstrap.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:21.163Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:23.586Z)

And if that's the case, you know, we could be you know, working for free for another year. But Right. On the flip side,

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:03:33.073Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-09T19:03:33.166Z)

we're not sharing anything with with somebody else. So so that's why I mentioned, you know, I'm a little leery of VCs because a typical VC will not only take a portion of the ownership, but they will create a board of directors, the board of directors then have control. If they say, you know, we don't like the way Diane's running this. Diane's out. Yeah. It's like, I'm not you know, I that's the last thing I wanna do is

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:00.663Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:04.566Z)

know, I'm I'm okay sharing a portion of the pie. I'm not okay giving somebody else control over

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:08.753Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:10.556Z)

our

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:11.393Z)

That

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:11.616Z)

future. Future. Okay. And so you feel like an incubator through, like, a Arcadia

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:14.583Z)

decisions in our company in our future. Yes. Yes. Okay. And so you feel like an incubator through, like, a Bercadia or

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:18.976Z)

a safer way to go on something like that.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:21.213Z)

CBRE is a safer way to go on something like that?

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:21.576Z)

I I think it is. Yeah. Because you're not really a VC.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:24.703Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:25.456Z)

They're they're more of a it it's really more of a partnership. Type of of of arrangement. So

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:32.083Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:35.246Z)

you know, you're not gonna get as big of a check. From them. But you will get

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:39.133Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:40.446Z)

mentoring. I you know, I don't know. From a from a financial standpoint. You know, whether we're talking, you know, a hundred thousand 5,000, you know, Right.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:51.193Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:51.826Z)

But it I I do think that that would be a very way a good way of going.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:04:54.873Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-09T19:04:56.796Z)

And that's another area where I do kind of disagree with Mark, is that I think I I think the broker market is what's really going to get us started, get the foot in the door, you know, because it opens up a lot of other areas as well. I know that the owners would be I mean, obviously, we don't ignore the owners. But I'm I would like to learn more about why Mark feels that targeting the owners out of the gate is the best way to go. I mean, I'm just I'm trying to wrap my head around it. I'm not seeing where Okay. Where that's an advantage.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:05:34.943Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:05:36.886Z)

But And a marketing plan together with holding the system. I mean, I think that's

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:05:41.823Z)

He'll be putting a marketing plan together, which we'll need to sit down. I mean, I think that's the impetus is that has to come together with the analyst reviews. Right? And then

### You (2025-06-09T19:05:45.856Z)

reviews. Right? And the decide on Right? And it might be true. Long. We might just have to

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:05:50.713Z)

we decide on and it might be pure luck too. We might just have to say,

### You (2025-06-09T19:05:51.386Z)

say, we target 20 potential users and we just start to go out.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:05:54.753Z)

we target 20 potential users

### You (2025-06-09T19:05:56.386Z)

Users and and

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:05:57.773Z)

we just start to go out. Users and and

### You (2025-06-09T19:05:57.776Z)

possible investors. Right? Because I stand by and I thought that Sam's office could

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:00.793Z)

investors. Right? Because I stand by my thought that family office could be a very viable

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:01.776Z)

a very viable way to raise some money.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:05.763Z)

way for us to raise some money.

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:06.566Z)

Yep. So another thing I'll just

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:08.903Z)

Yep. So and the other thing I'll just say is because

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:09.096Z)

say is because you know, I I have been in the process before I did this

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:13.423Z)

you know, I I have been in the process

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:14.756Z)

I I thought about going full print jobs.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:16.713Z)

before I did this, I I thought about going and looking for a job someplace else.

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:17.146Z)

Myself. But summer a terrible to look for a job. People just shut down

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:20.843Z)

The summer is a terrible time to look for a job. People just

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:23.476Z)

They don't wanna a decision.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:25.483Z)

shut down. They don't wanna make any decisions. Everyone's on vacation.

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:25.686Z)

Everyone's up. Vacation. So it's almost like your job search

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:29.913Z)

So it's almost like your job search

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:30.146Z)

just has to pause during the summer and then it comes later today. It

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:33.043Z)

just has to pause during the summer. And then come Labor Day, it

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:34.566Z)

would soon. So it's like, Yeah. And then

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:37.443Z)

resumes. At least that's what it was like for me. And then, you know,

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:40.266Z)

and he's still very tough job

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:41.273Z)

it will resume on Labor Day, and it was still a very tough job market.

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:43.286Z)

which bolstered me even more of that.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:46.123Z)

Which

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:46.566Z)

This

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:46.933Z)

just bolstered me even more that

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:48.526Z)

is something that

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:49.463Z)

it's

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:51.113Z)

this is something that

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:51.366Z)

complete. Repeated.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:52.643Z)

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:52.986Z)

In our industry.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:54.403Z)

completely needed in our industry

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:55.036Z)

I that, like, how said, it's such a

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:06:57.393Z)

I believe that, like Howard has said, it's

### You (2025-06-09T19:06:58.416Z)

unique that

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:00.593Z)

such a unique vertical that if we just get in here early,

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:02.936Z)

've I've

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:05.823Z)

I believe I mean, I I know a lot of

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:06.436Z)

to fail. But

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:08.933Z)

start ups fail, but we've done this very well. Like,

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:09.936Z)

We partnered multifamily technology experts with

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:12.793Z)

we partnered multifamily technology experts with

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:13.776Z)

hospitality people who have

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:16.803Z)

hospitality,

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:17.106Z)

deep depths into the industry. Right? So

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:18.413Z)

people who have deep deep depths into the industry. Right? So

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:21.066Z)

I I we're out of the in a better position than a lot of startups are.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:24.213Z)

I I think we're out of the gates in a better position than a lot of start ups

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:26.496Z)

For for success. And

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:28.163Z)

are for for success.

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:29.266Z)

we just maybe have to take it, like, smaller

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:31.453Z)

And we just maybe have to take it, like, smaller

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:31.976Z)

chunks at a time. Called, like,

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:35.163Z)

chunks at a time of call like,

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:35.226Z)

three hundred four hundred ish call. Yeah. Which hang up. Something. Maybe not a full salary. But today. Something. Yeah. So And to your point, there is no better marketing material than a client testimonial. So, you know, it it really does boil down to, you know, we can get somebody on that advisory board to actually

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:07:38.283Z)

300 ish, 400 ish k which would pay us something, maybe not a full salary, but it would pay pay us something. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-09T19:07:59.656Z)

not only give a testimonial, but basically commit to using it. And, you know, if we could get the Brocadia team or CBRE, to test it. And actually use it and to be a testimonial. I mean, if you get in with somebody who people everybody in the industry recognizes the name, that is I mean, then you're everything is downstream down downhill from there. I mean, you can just coast. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:08:30.693Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-09T19:08:31.326Z)

Right. So, yeah, I think I do think that that not only is the family office route viable, I think it might be preferable. But, yeah, I I I really think that you know we do need to start getting outside people testing it for us and giving us some guidance. And like I said, if we can get some of the bigger players in there as well, that would definitely be to our advantage. So

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:03.663Z)

Right. So, Vinod, have

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:03.716Z)

So Because I to I

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:08.633Z)

I think we're in a better position than a lot of start up. It's not just

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:09.616Z)

I because

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:13.393Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:17.223Z)

that has already been successfully monetized in other sectors of the real estate space.

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:17.866Z)

real estate space. And and I know to pick up on this other call. But one observation I had is

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:22.133Z)

And and I know we have to jump on this other call, but one observation I've had is we

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:23.236Z)

come through this,

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:26.383Z)

gone through this is I you know, Mark and I and Drew have worked with

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:30.926Z)

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:32.553Z)

us for twenty years. So we're like I mean, we speak, like,

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:33.326Z)

fast and, like, in the process. But it's been interesting to watch you guys

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:36.473Z)

fast and, like, the process. But it's been interesting to watch

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:36.996Z)

So like, how hospitality space is.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:39.583Z)

you guys absorb, like, how the hospitality space is modeled.

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:40.006Z)

In the model. The differences in the similarities to multi family.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:44.313Z)

The differences in the similarities to multifamily,

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:44.636Z)

And I walked away. From that. With pure

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:48.033Z)

And I have walked away from that with

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:48.496Z)

conviction that someone from the hospital

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:51.093Z)

pure conviction that no there has to be someone from the hospitality that

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:51.976Z)

that does this for the hospitality industry. I know. This could not be done by

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:55.433Z)

does this for the hospitality industry.

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:56.896Z)

deal panel or a wreck.

### Guest (2025-06-09T19:09:58.543Z)

This could not be done by a deal path or a

### You (2025-06-09T19:09:59.236Z)

Or something. They didn't have hospitality expertise.
