# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:31:52.695Z)

Hello. I'm gonna be off camera.

### You (2025-11-20T22:31:57.735Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:32:03.895Z)

I'm just texting Mark. Now that it starts to get, you know, quote, unquote cold in California. I turn my heater on? But then it immediately gets. Like, too hot. Clearly very, very California, various Southern California of me to complain and say about the weather when it's, like, really very nice all the time.

### You (2025-11-20T22:32:49.815Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:32:52.455Z)

You too have cold weather. I mean, here, like. I mean, I occasionally. Like it's raining right now, but I would say California rarely has what would actually qualify as poor weather. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, no, it's generally very nice.

### You (2025-11-20T22:33:12.775Z)

But. Yeah, other than that.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:33:20.935Z)

All right. Let me. Let me just email Mark, too. But. Okay, so. What? Okay? So what did you want to talk about? What was the. It sounds like this is the same things we were chatting about on the product team. Message.

### You (2025-11-20T22:34:05.415Z)

I just said we don't need to meet now because I think Vanilla made a very good point. That we won't change anything for the mvp. Let's just go ahead and let them wrap up what it is. And I think that's a good idea. We don't have to demo the exact lender. We just need to show the primary features that work. Document. Upload an extraction, populating the model, et cetera. And then. We can pivot to make those changes to the model that we need for the lender version.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:34:41.575Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-20T22:34:42.375Z)

To me.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:34:45.175Z)

Wait. Sorry. Let me make sure I so. We'll focus on finishing what was in the video. That will be the mvp. But it's not including. That will not include the lender. Specific things that we've talked about that would be.

### You (2025-11-20T22:35:05.015Z)

Yeah. Still very good for demo. And if we're speaking to a prospective lender prospect, let me just say these KPIs on the top will be replaced with lender specific KPIs. We'll have a couple things in there, so I think if they see that it works, Whether it's calculating a cash on cash or whether it's calculating that that service coverage ratio, I don't think it's going to matter. We're just doing an intro anyway. So I think that'll be fine. And I don't think it's going to be two terribly long between the MVP and when we. Get the version 1 lender up during the holidays. Not likely to schedule many demos anyway.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:36:02.535Z)

Yeah. I mean, I think the question. Is, do we? I mean, originally, we were. We were discussing that we would. Try to schedule something the first week of December. With? Probably with access point financial. Is that? Those lender pieces. Are not going to be done. Yet. Then it might be better to wait. An extra couple of weeks. And this is. And just to like. To pull back a minute. As I said in one of my messages. We kind of touched on two days ago. Like. The. The companies we're meeting with. Even the biggest of them. Well, I shouldn't say the biggest. The biggest of them would be different. Like Starwood Capital. Do you know star capitalists? Yeah. So They're a customer of mine. Already. They. They have a technology team. They have a full built out, huge technology team that I work a ton with. That is extremely unusual. Nobody else. I mean, other than maybe Brookfield and Blackstone have that. Every other company, even the big ones. Are like. They're, they're. They're pretty scrappy, for lack of a better word. Like, my biggest Customer has over 100 hotels. They have, like.

### You (2025-11-20T22:37:31.255Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:37:35.095Z)

Three people on their asset management team, three people on their accounting team. I mean, they have an IT department that does like their, you know, their outlook and their emails and their firewalls and that stuff, but they don't have anything to do or any interest in or knowledge of what we're talking. About? It's just that there's a gap, kind of, and I think it might be different for, like, other. Industries other asset classes where you have. More. You have vts, you have mri, you have yardi, you have, like. Where it's common to have integrations and connections and utilization that supports the need of a technology expert. But that just doesn't exist here. Which is why, more often than not, the people we're going to talk with. Are coo coos. Chief investment officers or, you know, like, you know, they're not going to be a technology person. But they. They will be somebody that's in a position to like, to make a decision. Right. So it might. Like Sunstone is a customer of mine that has only 16 hotels. And they have. I mean, like, there's. There. 's dissociative analysts. There's the directors, vps, and then there's the CEO. There's like. They don't have a CEO. Excuse me? They don't have a coo. They don't have a cio. They don't have a cto. They don't. Have they just.

### You (2025-11-20T22:39:12.375Z)

Okay, so is that we made into my comment about sellington CEOs.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:39:22.935Z)

Drew is frozen, I believe.

### You (2025-11-20T22:39:25.175Z)

Frozen.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:39:25.975Z)

Sorry. There we are. Back.

### You (2025-11-20T22:39:27.815Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:39:28.055Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-20T22:39:28.135Z)

There you go.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:39:29.815Z)

Sorry. And the reason I'm saying all this is just. To because I think you have said right. Like, you know from, from your experience, and your preferred approach is like, how we would solve this, which. I. I think makes sense in a lot of cases. I mean, even my platform, I try to sell it. To analysts first. But ultimately, like, just given the nature of hotel real estate and hotels, like, they're, I think they are somewhat unique. And therefore, like the approach, will be a little different.

### You (2025-11-20T22:40:04.535Z)

Yeah, I understand. What we're feeling really to the tech people. Although some of the larger, more sophisticated ones, like you said, that do have tech teams. They're going to be concerned about security data. All these things, but my point was, like you said, The people who will be using this day to day. Are the ones that have to be involved, whether they're our first point of contact. Probably not if you've got a structure, like you said, where you've got a CEO. Another layer, and then you've got the analysts. Right. You're probably going to be very junior. Analysts. But. Lar kind of validated what I said as well, that he said, well, the CEO is going to be there, but he's still going to bring in. He started the list off a few other people, which is like. Well, yeah. That was probably closer to the point than what I articulated, not what I articulated. That if it's a one on one with the CEO. Ce. Os typically aren't the gatekeepers that we have to get past.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:41:15.655Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-20T22:41:16.695Z)

That's it.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:41:16.855Z)

There's. Yes, These companies are all going to. Yeah. Yeah, we're generally going to get, or at least I, I agree. And I think Mark also agrees, like, we're going to try to get the immediate group of people involved that, hey, hey, Mark.

### You (2025-11-20T22:41:30.535Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:41:34.135Z)

Yeah. So. Okay. Mark, we were just talking about the. Approach to, you know, to sales and selling about. You know, talking to CEOs, COOs or analysts and what you had said the other day. Two days ago about, you know, talking to the CEO, but he's going to have his whole team in the room is exactly, I think, what Howard was talking about and wanting to make sure we had all the key players, stakeholders that would be utilizing our system. Get buy in. You know, so that way. It's going to need everybody's buy in to, you know, to get them to sign up. Even if it's the CEO that makes the final decision. Mark, you're on mute. You're on mute. Oh, hi. Sorry about that. Yeah, I mean, again, I, I, I, I think that the hotel world is a little bit different. These lenders are entrepreneurial businesses. And, you know, ultimately, you know, the analysts will use the system, but, you know, going starting at the top is a very effective way to go. You know, clearly, they'll be buying along the way. But, you know, having the CEO on a call, I don't see how that could be a bad thing. Yeah, when it sounds like what you said is just, it's. It's not just the CEO. It's going to be the immediate group of people that would be involved at the COO or cio and then the associate. Just similar to like, how I mean, that that's been the most successful on my end with, like, Sunstone. When I presented to them, it was their CEO. And it was there probably a group of 10 people that I went in and presented to, and they deliberated and they, you know, and then ultimately said yes. So it sounds like it's the same. We're talking about the same thing, which is good. Yeah, no, I certainly think so. Yeah. But again, I mean, you know, when I met with the CEO, he said he would organize a team of people to be part of the presentation. And, I mean, I think that that's. That's a great way to begin the process. No, Agreed. Agree. And then the only other thing, we. We didn't actually talk about the product. That was what we were going to talk about, but it sounds like. Howard and Vinod have what they need. I guess the question is, let me share my screen here. Hopefully my Internet doesn't cop out. Well, did you mark a do chance to watch my video? I started three times, but for the fourth time will be a charm. All right. Howard asked if it was, if there was anything in it that was lender specific, and there is not. It is all just about, you know, going through the pro forma, the valuation and the investment summary tab as they are now. Will the top screen be different for lender? Will we have the. That was part of what we were talking about, and I think, yes, it will be, or it can be different for lenders. And that was the point we were discussing is like, is that necessary for access Point Financial? And it absolutely is, yes. So, you know, I think it's critical because again, you know, we want them to feel like this is custom designed for lenders. Of course, when we meet with a acquisition group, we'll say it's custom designed for the acquisition group. But if we can keep the infrastructure the same, but have the results screen. Tailored to the recipient's business, then it'll feel much more. Customized. Yeah. Yeah. Howard Bennett. Do you guys have a good sense of what the differences are between what we have here now and what. Is the sort of lender Persona view, and I think it's really just the valuation inputs. That the modal that we've. Howard, you said you weren't even working on, and then this investment summary. I mean, it's the same. All this stuff is the same. It's. I think it's really just these metrics on top and maybe. A slightly different. Calculation. I mean, I'm trying to think about. Like, I guess. I guess it's not even different calculations. It's really just. Really just these things on top, I think.

### You (2025-11-20T22:46:26.455Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:46:27.895Z)

Yes. It's just the cover page really needs to be. Adjusted.

### You (2025-11-20T22:46:34.935Z)

Y. Eah. So I was putting together the requirements in creating the document, I realized that we probably don't even need the valuation tab for the lender.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:46:36.615Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-20T22:46:47.255Z)

That most of the inputs that are required are on the modal that I showed everybody. There might be a couple things that we want, you know, like the exit cap rate. And a couple other things. But you know, the loan amount, the interest rate, the whole period. I mean, all of those. Deorization, interest only. I call those inputs that are on the valuation page. Are already on the mobile, so they'll go and set that up. So one thing I do need to do is go through this page. And see. What, if anything, might need to be added to that bubble, and then they get everything all set up at the first time. So really, we're just looking at the proforma in the investment summary.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:47:31.255Z)

Yeah. I mean, you may want to. I mean, in terms of, like, what. What the lender wants again, it's. It's. I guess maybe we want to. You know, we definitely want loan amount. We want, you know, debt yield debt service coverage and, you know, maybe there's, you know, one thing that the lender does like to keep an eye on is loan to value. So if we want to do an ltv, then we also need to talk about what the cap rate is and kind of what the. Oh, and we should also do, we should do loan amount, loan per key. Debt service coverage Debt yield.

### You (2025-11-20T22:48:01.735Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:48:02.535Z)

And then maybe we want to talk about, you know, ltv, loans of value and what the cap rate is being used to calculate that ltv.

### You (2025-11-20T22:48:12.535Z)

Y.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:48:12.775Z)

I mean, if that could be the top.

### You (2025-11-20T22:48:12.855Z)

Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:48:14.615Z)

I think that would be great.

### You (2025-11-20T22:48:17.175Z)

That's actually what we put down because I sent out an email, jewelry started, and I think those would be exact. Codes that you put on there. I know we've got the best service yield. The LTV will have the other ones as well. And then we'll name it. To calculate the ltv. We've got an assumed cap rate, exit cap rate, all that information on that tab there. So I think we're good to go. It's just a matter of making those changes. In the.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:48:48.695Z)

Okay, that's great. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-20T22:48:49.175Z)

Model.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:48:50.615Z)

So, first thing is, I think let's figure out what exactly we need for Lender specific, what exact changes we need. From the product side, right? Just let's be specific.

### You (2025-11-20T22:49:02.295Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:49:02.535Z)

On the requirements. I think that will probably need a meeting between Howard Drew and Mark. I think you guys would probably decide what exactly needs to be changed. And, you know, as we were talking earlier, we can take that as v1. And then the other thing we need to prioritize is user onboarding. So lender specific changes. And I think the second should be user onboarding because we haven't done anything for that. What does that mean? What is it? How how the users will. Be managed within our application. How the groups or what kind of different users will. Be part of that group like analyst, admin and what all access level the users will have. Okay. Yeah, but that. That's secondary. I mean, I think if we can. If we can get what Howard just described working well. That other stuff is not. I don't. I don't think that's as important for the initial demos. Yeah, not really for demo, but I mean, once, you know, we kind of someone, you know, wants to be on boarded on our platform. Oh. You know, ultimately. Ultimately, that's very important. But I'm just trying to think in terms of order of priority. Yeah, yeah. The order of priority would be lender specific changes probably. Faster and then the user onboarding sale. Perfect. Great. Okay? And Howard, that input modal does that speed. Like my or the way I imagine it is like, that would usually would put those things in and then it would populate. This like, it would populate. Like, you wouldn't necessarily remove or any of these things here. They would stay here. They would just get populated from the input modal up front. And then if somebody wanted to change them, they could go back and do it here.

### You (2025-11-20T22:51:05.815Z)

We could do that. I don't think we would need the acquisition. Page that you have there. So we probably would narrow it down. Just refinancing, equity and exit. In the document. Fields. Are the same as in the existing made would be mapped basically to the same spot in the database. So, yeah, if you update one, it'll automatically show in the other, so, yeah. You could do what you said. Just if I want to change some of the financing assumptions. I don't know if they even need the equity portion. Are they concerned about. Who's. The partners.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:51:54.535Z)

Well.

### You (2025-11-20T22:51:55.735Z)

Or.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:51:56.455Z)

No, that. That part isn't. But you know, they're going to want purchase price. You know? Like, in order to make the calculations work, I mean, you have to have. I think you have to. You have to have the equity piece there. The dividends is really just that, you know, in the lender's case, the lender is like their perspective. They. They are the financing versus in the equity. It's, you know, they are the equity. But the, you know, the pro forma piece, everything else stays the same. It's really just like. From which perspective are you. Are you.

### You (2025-11-20T22:52:34.775Z)

The purchase price would be. We can add that into the setup mode. That's open type input. I mean, the purchase price is what it is. That's not going to change.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:52:45.895Z)

Right. Well, during, you know, during. A. A due diligence acquisitions or loan. You know, if you're evaluating a loan, the purchase price might. Change. You might think it's going to start with 150 million, but then it might end up being 165 or 1. So it needs to be editable, but. But it's not, right? And also, I mean, Drew, a lot of times, you know, you have purchase price, but then you also have. Like a capital improvement budget. And then the lender is landing on the combination of those two. So we may want to break that down. Right. Because in order to get to the loan to cost. For loan to value. Ultimately, you want to have both inputs. There is a.

### You (2025-11-20T22:53:24.695Z)

So when we are talking about speaking to lenders, are we looking at loan origination or are we looking at loan servicing? Because I was kind of thinking, well, on the servicing lines, because they have to input. Each month.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:53:42.135Z)

You know, I think ultimately Howard will probably, you know, they will use it for both. Right. Because.

### You (2025-11-20T22:53:49.495Z)

Who are you going through first?

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:53:51.735Z)

Well, I mean, the guys that we're talking to or the people we're talking to, or do both. So, I mean, maybe for purposes of the initial presentation, we could make it for loan monitoring.

### You (2025-11-20T22:53:55.815Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:54:02.215Z)

But we could say that ultimately, you know, there's going to be an investment module that can do your underwriting as well. But I think at this point, what lenders, the problem that they have is that they've got, you know, in some cases, hundreds of loans. And they don't really have a system for, you know, uniformly monitoring everything. In one consistent format. So they're using a lot of different systems and, you know, we could become sort of the all inclusive system for all of their loans, which is, I think, something that they very much want. So. That's a good question, though.

### You (2025-11-20T22:54:33.975Z)

So what we have now is very close to loan origination or underwriting, right?

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:54:39.575Z)

Yeah, I think it's that. 's almost. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

### You (2025-11-20T22:54:44.455Z)

Yeah, we would just need to change a couple of the KPI cards on top. The equity. Like I said, they want no one amount being able to loan is going to be. I don't know if anybody care about the buyer who's got what percentage. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. But in that case. We could make fewer changes. To get this ready to present as a loan origination or underwriting tool and then follow up with loan servicing.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:55:19.495Z)

Yeah. I think the servicing part, though, is going to be more valuable to them.

### You (2025-11-20T22:55:23.495Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:55:24.215Z)

Because in, in speaking with a bunch of lenders, you know, they all kind of claim that they don't really have a system that allows them to efficiently monitor loans. And, you know, as we talked about in the past, every month they're getting more information. Which is currently being input manually. And it's a, you know, it should be. Don't. It should be automated. But no one seems to have the system to do that, which is our. One of our opportunities.

### You (2025-11-20T22:55:47.495Z)

Y. Eah. Okay? So if we were to be able to get a double ready, Product, full name, underwriting or origination. We don't need to worry about leaking out the financial statements by month. We would continue to use the annual. Overtime being. So a lot of the developers to continue working on extracting the monthly data. We could review those five KPA cards on top and replace those with other ones. You know, they're not looking for the cash on cash or the irr. Those are the ones we would replace with the loan. The value or the. Yeah, the debt service. Debt, you know? Loan debt value. Few other things, so it would be a much easier. And faster. Demo at least a word. 1.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:56:39.255Z)

Yeah. Right, but I thought we were focusing on the servicing part first.

### You (2025-11-20T22:56:48.055Z)

Word, but that's. That's a lot more complicated. And that's going to delay getting it out. So I think we can.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:56:50.695Z)

Yeah. I know, but I think the servicing part is what they really want. You know, unfortunately. I think that's. That's our better hook.

### You (2025-11-20T22:57:04.935Z)

If that's okay. So we'll just keep building the same load. It's just going to take on a little bit longer to get there. I know that they're making good progress. You can jump in here real quick, but I know they're making progress. On the. Monthly extension. So maybe it's not that big of a deal. Maybe it won't take as long.

### Guest (2025-11-20T22:57:24.135Z)

If we don't have the monthly and we want to focus on the annual extraction. And then we say to them that the monthly is coming soon. But if we could do the like, how long will it take to do the monthly piece? Monthly is in progress right now. We are working on that Year Zero thing. It's definitely taking a little time. So I don't think I can give you the exact time frame for that, but, yeah, it's in progress. That's what I would say. So are we talking weeks or a month or. I mean, just roughly? Probably weeks. But I think. I think. To, I guess, just try to, like. Close loop on this. It sounds like access point financials interest is in being able to gather the data for their existing loans, right for tracking. Returns, cash on cash. You know, debt, yield, et cetera. More so than having their acquisitions or underwriting team go in and. Underwrite deals. Yeah, I think, but I. I think that's well said. I mean, again, ultimately, I think they want both. But I think right now, they and quite a few lenders that I've spoken with, they need a system to input all the data on all of their loans and have an efficient way to monitor them on a monthly basis to check for, you know, ultimately debt yield, debt service and things of that nature that that's what they all seem to be kind of desperately looking for.

### You (2025-11-20T22:59:03.415Z)

Yeah. I was looking through my notes from some of those earlier calls that we had, making sure that I covered everything. And one of the things that jumped out to me is. I don't. I'd have to go back and see who it was specifically that said it. But she said that. Getting the data from the buyer to the lender. Is very regulated. That it cannot go through and obediently system. It has to go directly from the lender to them. And a lot of times it's just an attachment on an email. So one of the things we're going to have to consider, it's been done for years. But we could have a dedicated email for each borrower. They could Send it to InnVestAI 1, 2, 3, for 5, whatever their account number is, and we could extract that email or the document. From the email. And we do something going to the lender. But that's one thing we have to consider. Is what type of regulations or probations are you going to have?

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:00:10.775Z)

Well, I mean, could the lender and the borrower be online together? And could the borrower just submit their monthly directly through InnVestAI to the lender? Like, could it just be a seamless connection with each other?

### You (2025-11-20T23:00:11.415Z)

With.

And just send it reporting directly through InnVestAI. Yes.

### You (2025-11-20T23:00:28.375Z)

Our interpretation of what you said is that that would not be permissible. Maybe it's just their company, I don't know. But they said you can.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:00:35.255Z)

Yeah. I don't know about that because, you know, a group like Access, you know, the definition of a lender has changed a lot in the last decade. You know, in the old days, a lender used to be like a, you know, Chase bank or a, you know, Wells Fargo. Now a lot of the lenders are you know, private equity firms. That have reengineered themselves and are now just sort of having a lending division. So, you know, the term lender is really not even regulated anymore. There's been a lot of changes to the industry. So, you know, whoever. I don't remember that conversation specifically, but maybe it was more like a traditional lender, like a Wells Fargo that's governed by the FDIC and all these other regulators, as opposed to a, you know, access point is really just a fund, you know, where they raise a bunch of money. And they have a bunch of smart people lending it out, right? So it's, you know, they're a lender, but they're not like a regulated lender. They're not a part of the problem because these companies have grown so rapidly. And they never really build a technology to match their growth rate.

### You (2025-11-20T23:01:33.015Z)

Okay? That makes sense. I just didn't want to get too far down the road building this tool where you can drive and drop your documents or have an API. Into in that state and then find out that we can't be that intermediary that has.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:01:49.095Z)

And by the way, I don't think we have to build that API now. We could just tell them that that's part of our growth plan. So we could say without doing it, and then we could test them for a reaction and see what they say. We can just make it part of, like, our presentation notes.

### You (2025-11-20T23:02:03.575Z)

One of the things I talked about, too. If that's the case, you know, we could help. Whoever the client is, create the API so it could go from the Borrower to them, and then to us. There would be an extra step. Within there, but.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:02:17.335Z)

Yeah. I mean, ultimately, they may not want us to be part of that because of confidentiality, but, I mean, in a perfect world, if they could just, you know, if XYZ Borrower could, you know, communicate directly through access points,

### You (2025-11-20T23:02:18.135Z)

If.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:02:31.095Z)

You know, InnVestAI connection. Right. That would just make everyone's life so much more efficient. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-20T23:02:38.135Z)

It misunderstanding what she said. So if that's the case, then it's in.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:02:38.375Z)

Yeah. Well, we may both be right. Like, it may be for more of a regulated lender again, like a Wells Fargo or a Chase, but it may not be as though plugable for an access point or, you know, a, you know, one of these sort of more entrepreneurial type lenders. Yeah, I'm pretty sure we should. It should be within the realm of possibility to have the Borrower. Have a login or some. Or maybe they just email it and it goes to an InnVestAI email account. And the best part of that is we get two fee paying customers instead of one. Yeah, exactly. You get. Yeah, so. Yeah, I think that that's definitely doable. So just to. Okay, so just. Next steps. The monthly being able to. To process and store and, you know, report on the data monthly. The and I guess by to clarify, like. Monthly as in. Showing 12 months of data. Right. It's trailing twelve. Right. You always want to be updating that. Trailing twelve. Right. Remember, we talked about that, you know, at the beginning of the year, actually in, like, November, December of the prior year. You know, the borrow will submit a budget for the next year by month. And then every month, you know, the lender will substitute the budget with the actual for that month.

### You (2025-11-20T23:04:10.935Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:04:11.015Z)

Yeah, I think there is. There is a. I mean, the other five monthly. We mean being able to consume data, updated data every month, right? Which is like the next month close, the next month's forecast, etc. I think we are. We can already consume data, as you know, as frequently as we want. It is just not displayed. With, you know, a 12 month spread. So for the purposes of the demo, is it, you know, is it possible that. We. Go what we have, or, you know, just show what we have here. And speak to how an operator or a borrower can. Submit their financial reporting every month. And something like this will get updated every month with the most recent T12. Or it doesn't. We don't. I guess. I don't think. I'm wondering, I mean. And, Lar, this is a question for you. If we never showed something that actually showed data. Month, you know, on a month by month. Like 12 month spread. Are they going to care? Or is it sufficient to say this is what the system does? It can take data, you know, month by month. They can take updated forecasts, whatever, and it will, all of this will update continuously. Yeah. I mean, I think we can show part of it and say part of it is coming over the next 60 days or something, and I think you'll get it. Yeah. Because I think we can talk about, like, we don't have, like, reporting, like, there can be a whole slew of things we can add related to how the data is displayed. Yeah, I mean, I think, I think we can organize, you know, the part of the presentation could be what we have now, and then we can talk about, you know, the next, you know, module, which will be coming in 60 days, that'll have five other things. Okay, so we can sort of. We can sort of fudge part of it.

### You (2025-11-20T23:06:02.695Z)

So, so keep in mind, from, from their point of view, the process is identical. All they have to do is upload the financial statement.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:06:10.375Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-20T23:06:12.135Z)

And what we can say is where we have we're two year three. And so again, we're in February, March. It's just a matter of breaking out, buying month levels and just having it by year.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:06:28.455Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-20T23:06:31.015Z)

Working on that year. That's something we have to be able to call it. You have to be able to prime rate and everything. So I. Once we have the year zero taken care of, it's. It's the same process for each month, right? So.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:06:52.295Z)

Okay? All right. Cool, so. Sounds like. Let's. I mean, we will be meeting on Tuesday, and the plan will be to have the things that in the video completed as well as, I mean, the note. Howard, you know, will the. Cards. Updated set of cards on the Value Investment Summary Sheet. Specific to a lender. Be ready then as well.

### You (2025-11-20T23:07:23.655Z)

I. I. I think so. We'll take a look. I think we've got all of the data needed for the calculations. We just need to change the label on the cards. And. And right now they're just static cards. We just have to get them. Calculating and displaying an actual value.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:07:43.415Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-20T23:07:43.895Z)

By Tuesday. Probably not by Tuesday. But. We'll have everything. Lined up and ready to go. Knowing what the devs have to finish.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:07:55.175Z)

It sounds like. Okay, so it sounds like we're again, very close. But if we want to wait, maybe trying to set up a meeting with them the first week of December is not. Realistic. Although.

### You (2025-11-20T23:08:14.695Z)

At what we talk about on Tuesday and make that decision, whether we can still sign up for the first week or if we need to push it back a week or two.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:08:23.815Z)

I mean. Yeah. Then it's the December week of December 8th, and then the 15th. So, you know, as the holidays get closer, obviously. Yeah. Keep in mind, I mean, the year kind of ends by the 12th. That's the absolute latest. Right. That's second Friday.

### You (2025-11-20T23:08:36.055Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:08:39.655Z)

After that, people are definitely in holiday mode.

### You (2025-11-20T23:08:42.615Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-20T23:08:46.615Z)

Let's. Let's rediscuss on Tuesday and see where things stand. Yeah. If you guys have questions now and then, just text me. And I could always jump on a call or zoom. In. All right, sounds good. All right. Thanks, guys.
