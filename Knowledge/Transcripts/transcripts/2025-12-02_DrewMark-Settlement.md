# Transcript for: Drew/Mark Settlement

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:04.318Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:06.079Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:09.358Z)

Everyone. I'm not including my note taker. But if you want to run Granola in the background, it's much better than anything else.

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:22.879Z)

Mike, how are you?

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:24.958Z)

I think you might be on mute. I don't know why it always does that. I would recommend not recording this call.

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:31.919Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:32.158Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:32.879Z)

No, no problem.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:34.958Z)

So on high end. There's no recording. You could take notes if you want, but I would. I mean, if part of this meeting, I'm probably going to act as an attorney, so I would. It's protected by attorney client privilege. I wouldn't have it recorded.

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:36.399Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:50.318Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T22:31:50.879Z)

Makes makes sense.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:31:51.518Z)

So. Okay. Where are you? I saw your letter. I, I have one tweet to it. It, it looked fine. I just, there's, I think, your last paragraph that says I'm not making legal conclusions, but the attorney or something, blah, blah, blah. And then you, then you have like, without admitting or blah, blah, blah. I would just start that paragraph with at the without admitting. He's not expecting you to take any legal positions. And when you say without admitting, I mean, that's. That's fine. So I would just. That last paragraph, I would just say without admitting. The other thing I saw in that letter was. Removing all their stuff, you know, all the mentions and. And so forth. I did not see anything about, like, deleting data from the database or anything like that. And so I just had a question about that. We're not supposed to, right? Well, I would preserve it. In a external hard drive. If it could fit on a usb, I'd put on that. If you needed, you know, something slightly larger, just whatever will fit, I'd preserve it so it's not gone forever. But I would say, I would tell them we move the data for. For preservation purposes to an external hard. Drive or storage device if it's usb. And we've purged the database of all data that Drew had provided, so we are not using anything that, per your letter, that Drew has provided. Okay, so, Howard, is that actually feasible for us to do? I'm. I'm just. Because I'm going to state that we're doing it. Should I say that we're in the process of doing it? Because we haven't done it yet. Like, and you're the IT person. You're the, you're the, you're the technology leader.

### You (2025-12-02T22:33:46.319Z)

Yeah. There's nothing to delete on what Vinod has put together. The only sample data that we have from Drew resides in Excel spreadsheets. We could download those to a thumb drive. In a matter of minutes.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:34:05.998Z)

Okay, so he. All the. All the. You know, from talking today, and he provided, like, customer data or test data, and it's just in the form of spreadsheets. It never ended up in a database.

### You (2025-12-02T22:34:17.279Z)

Now that I think about it, that's. That is not correct. Because as part of the testing process, Drew Wood upload a spreadsheet into the model. And then compare the output to the spreadsheet to make sure it matched. So I will get with the note and we will delete the database.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:34:36.798Z)

Diane, you could say we were in the process of. So it's not.

### You (2025-12-02T22:34:39.439Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:34:41.758Z)

Got it. And I have one more question about the letter that just came up this afternoon. I talked to and Sherman. These names might not be meaningful to you, but they will to Howard. I talked to Mark Woodworth today. He was very kind and understanding. He's a bit concerned. He understands the whole Mark thing. He's a little concerned about the Drew thing. Drew left him a message. He was calling Drew back. I explained the situation. I felt incredibly foolish for even bothering him with it. But that's on me. I'm the one who sent the email to the wrong mark. He said, what will Drew say to me? And I said, he's probably going to claim that he owns the ip. Without mentioning what the IP is, but. He's confirming, right? And I explained to Mark why we didn't think he owned vip, right? And Mark doesn't understand that left from right. But what I want to be careful of is if they tell Mark Woodward and I was honest with Mark Woodworth, that they. That they have claimed I committed fraud, right? Because it's in the letter and I want to head that off. If. If Drew actually says that to Mark Woodworth, should I mention that in the letter? No. Like that it we, you know, no mention of fraud? Or should I just leave that silent? Because to me, Telling people that I committed fraud is horrifically unprofessional. But what's an attorney's advice? What? I would not proactively, in your response, mention anything about it because you're without admitting anything you know is or lending any, you know, credibility credence to. Their accusations in the. In the letter. You're still complying with the letter? Do not argue or try to get your side out. Why? It wasn't fraud. It was negligence or I, I didn't know, like, no mention of it because a, it'll signal to them, hey, this is a touch point or a lever point that we could keep kneeling with. What I would do is if you hear from Mark Woodruff or Driftwood or someone like, hey, we're having second thoughts about being involved because we hear you're doing fraud. That's when they get a letter saying, you know, knock it off. You're. You're opening yourself up to a defamation lawsuit if you keep this up. Okay. And I just truly felt like I had to get ahead of that in case it happened from a business perspective. Right. And I tried to explain the situation the best I could, but. It's a hard thing to explain. But I just. It's an ugly word, and I didn't want Mark to Howard. From Drew without potentially hearing it from me. And for me. To. What's the word I'm looking for? To kind of almost dismiss it as being silly. You know what I mean? Howard, he asked what you thought, and I. I mean, I'm sorry if I spoke for you, but I told him that, you know. You did not. Well, he didn't actually ask it. Like that. But he did ask what you thought, and maybe I overstated that you thought it was an exaggeration on their part, but I said something along those lines.

### You (2025-12-02T22:37:57.359Z)

That's accurate.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:37:59.358Z)

The letter itself. You know, with its throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. You know, unjust enrichment, breach of this fraud, you know, blah, blah, blah. It reads like a typical season. You know, you're always. When you send those, you know, they're supposed to sound big and scary, and if you don't do this, then we're going to sue you for all this. Every letter, cease and desist letter that I've seen, that I've drafted, that I've received from behalf of clients, has said all similar languages. So you're complying with the letter, which is good. I. To me the most, and I think I mentioned this in the email, the silver lining and all this is at the very end, he's like, contact me if you want to discuss a resolution. So this is the door opening to working out the settlement now. Like this is they. They have come. When you don't send a cease and desist, when you think, oh, we're still going to all get back together Kumbaya and do this as five, you know, owners of this company, that ship has sailed. They know there's going to be a breakup of this relationship, and it's now a matter of how reasonable they are going to be in there. Resolution that they want to see, quote, unquote. And I would prefer to have them throw out the first proposal. So my. My thought would be, you know, you can send that response. With the changes. I would say send it to us one more time to review before you send it, just to make sure it's got all the changes in it. And then when you send it only to their attorney, not to them, try to avoid all contact with them. And I will, with your permission, I will call him the attorney and basically say, hey, I'm representing, you know, Diane and Howard and the. Or the remaining, you know, invest. The. The InnVestAI and Diana Howard for the, you know, discrete representation of seeing if we can work out a resolution. Your letter alluded to, you know. To contact you to discuss resolution. They're open to discussing that. And I would say, what do your clients, you know, have in mind? Like, what, what is a resolution on their hand? And, you know, and then they're going to say, we want. Everything right? We want. They're going to throw. I mean, it's just a negotiating tactic and they're going to say we want a hundred thousand each and blah, blah. There's no basis for any of that. And so I will. Then, you know, we'll go back and forth and be like, all right. There's no. There's nothing that's. Supports these damages or this payout. You know, if they go crazy, they may just say, I want, like, you know, 50,000 each or something. That would be great, because, you know, we're going to talk them down. Howard, what I told Diane the other day. Was. I think you know something they couldn't. Rationally. Question is. Okay, let's say, for the sake of argument, the only asset that this company has. Is this Safe agreement for $75,000. Like that's it. Like that's the only revenue you've raised. Everything else is liability and the cost, and there's no documentation. Supporting any loans, like Drew giving $10,000 to the company. Is not a loan. There's no. There needs to be a document so the company can write off that payment for tax purposes. Paying back. There's not. That's a. That's a capital contribution. That's his. He's just giving money to the company. So there's so. What I would, you know, I would think what I would be willing to, you know, have you guys agree to is if we just took, at the high level, $75,000. Divided by 5. Just add. Forget cost, forget anything that was taken out of it. Just the gross $75,000. Number divided by five is 15 each. And paying each of them $15,000 to sign the separation agreement, they're going away. Any separation agreement. Or any settlement agreement is going to be a confidential B is going to waive every single claim that they ever could have brought against any of you, individually or as a company. Both ways. Like everyone's going to waive every any claim they could have had and usually is broad. Like from the dawn of time until you know, the date of this agreement that could have been brought is, is waived, and they will, you know, divest, give up, forfeit and all. Current, present, past, future rights to any InnVestAI stuff. Let me hang on one second. I just want to pause and then come right back to this, but two points I want to make. It is 100% critical that Vinod stay off of all of this. And I think that Drew was being respectful and that he sent this to Howard and myself and not Vinod, but. I don't. And. And, Howard, please. I mean, I don't want to play. Like. I just. I don't want them threatening to get vinod into the middle of this. I hope Drew is professional enough, but I don't trust Mark, and maybe I even don't trust Drew, so that's. One thing. I just want to say that it's ultimately critical for us that Vinod. And how do you disagree with that? I mean, what I'm saying about Vinod staying off the claims and the letters and things. Well.

### You (2025-12-02T22:44:01.519Z)

I absolutely agree, as much as we can.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:44:04.798Z)

I, I I will not bring up his name. Okay? He would not need to sign the settlement agreement because it would be on behalf of the company and you two. And maybe he would set the sign up, but by then, it's. It's. He's. It's good, right? I mean, they're waiving because you want. I would say you want the. Node or Vinod would also want to be included in. They're waiving all claims that could be brought. Right. So Vinod said, yeah, I want to be involved and wave anything so they can't go after him for something. Because you wait. I think so, but. But we'll have to ask Vinod. Himself. Because this is like. Like this is one of his number one hot buttons, right? Immigrant plus legal claims equals bad situation. Yeah. So I'm saying at the very end, all five of you run out there, sign this agreement.

### You (2025-12-02T22:44:57.199Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:44:57.278Z)

I mean, if Vinod in the future. Honestly, it's. It. Like I said, it's tough love. He. He's putting himself out there as an owner of the company. Right. Any future claims? Technically the owner because she has a more stable visa than he does. And that's something that we've been. Talking about. So maybe it's his wife who needs to sign it. I don't know, but it would be. Whoever the owner is, the road has no rights if he's not an owner. I mean, like, he's. And if he's not even getting paid, he's not even an employee. He's just his wife stepping into that technical position just to. Because she's under a safer visa. But. But let's table that. You heard our concern and we understand what you're saying. We have to talk to Vinod. But I don't want to scare him. He's already scared enough. About all of this, and so, yeah, you have to talk to him. I'm not going to bring him up, okay? But I can prevent Mark from Drew from bringing him on. Like there's no legal justification to say we can't talk about it other than do they. I assume they know Vinod's wife isn't because we could say, hey, he's not a party. He's not even an owner. His wife who's the owner. Now if they say. If they say like what? We didn't know that we thought it was Vinod. You know that's going to be even crazier.

### You (2025-12-02T22:46:18.639Z)

They're fully aware. They're fully aware.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:46:18.798Z)

Part. Am I wrong here? Still fully aware. Okay.

### You (2025-12-02T22:46:21.039Z)

Yeah, we. We had many conversations about that when we were drafting the llc.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:46:22.078Z)

Okay? Okay, my second thing before we get back to settlement is I just want to make sure I know we're talking about someone. But again, everything I researched is in Delaware. Right. It's just they treat IT startups a little differently. And if you. Even if you have a verbal commitment and emails indicating a percentage share. If you don't have a signed llc, then they're not technically partners. There's nothing to dissolve. And I realized that under general law, it would be construed a partnership. But are we certain that we've checked everything in Delaware, and should we consider contacting a Delaware attorney for confirmation on any of this. I sent you the Delaware statute. About this solution? That's Delaware law code. You know, it says, hey, operating agreement controls. And then there was that absent and operating agreement. You need 62/3 votes of the members to dissolve. We never. Are you certain? I just. I. I know I keep being a pain in the ass about this, but maybe I'm prompting incorrectly, like, and I'm prompting to get the answer I want, but. Do you mind? I guess. What. What is. Okay, let's say you're right. Well, how do you want. To handle it, then. Like you just want to say, Diana, I'm the 100% owner. Screw everyone else. I get to dissolve the company. You're going to invite a lawsuit against you for sure. Okay? So we. The easiest way is to just go with your cease and desist letter. Let's negotiate a resolution. Lets everyone sign off any rights that they, you know, future, past, present. They can't waive rights they don't have. Right. So if they, if so, they can't come back later and claim. Some sort of ownership later because. So now let's jump back to the settlement for a minute because. And Howard is going to chime in here with his thoughts. This is 100%. Equal air time here. Drew, should 100% be paid back the money that he fronted the company? That is with interest or multiple I mean, that's the only, like, respectful, professional thing, in my opinion, to do. Mark did nothing. In fact, what he did do was so harmful to us from a toxic culture perspective that I just, like, this is where the rub comes for me, right? Drew is one thing to settle with. And even if It's Drew gets $15,000, right? But to me, Mark, he didn't show up for calls. He didn't contribute anything. He didn't share information like he should have. And he is a big source of I'm responsible for that. I'M the one who I. Am the one that allowed it to go on for as long. I did in the sake of collaboration. But I was wrong. I should have cut sooner. And so I have a hard time offering markup 15,000 when that 15,000 could really go to cover cost for Anode or reimbursement for Node for something that or for Howard. I mean, like, Mark deserves nothing, and so now. But, Howard, you jump in, because before I, like, have a flip out, you can have a totally, completely, totally different opinion on this. And we're. We're completely equal, right? And our view and our partnership here. So what do you think?

### You (2025-12-02T22:50:16.719Z)

You're right about the contribution. And, like, there's. We do have a spreadsheet that was maintained by Drew. That it contains the budget and also sources and uses. And he's actually got three separate columns, one for his contributions, one for Marx. And then one from the safe note. And Marx is all zeros. So the intent was to use Dru's 7500. Once that's gone, Mark would then contribute 7500. But to date, he has not contributed anything, so he doesn't have any financial skin in the game at all. I don't know. Sometimes, you know that that doesn't matter. You know that that's your call to determine. But I do agree. That, you know, if. If there's a way that he could just be. Excluded. You know. Thanks, but no thanks. It makes sense, you know, and maybe we just deal with Drew. I don't know if that's even a possibility.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:51:25.598Z)

So I. I would. I will say this. A couple things. The 15 is like. Not our starting point, not what we're going to offer. Like, if we can get them out lower, that's great. Like that's why I want them to put out the first offer. You know, we're not coming back. We're not going to put the first offer out there. The. The issue. So I'll. I'll tell you the same thing I told every one of my litigation clients from. And everyone of my clients have taken a position like Diane that you've taken is. I don't want to pay this person I once had the Indian CEO. Say I don't want to pay him. I'm not paying him, and he paid everyone. And he even said I'm. The quote was, I'm not going to pay him. I'm not going to pay you. You know, the lawyer's like, I'm not any paid everyone. But. The. The reality is. Mark is involved. He's admittedly 20% owner. You're not going to go back and say there's nothing in writing. Everyone operated under the fact that you all were 20% owners. Like, there's no way that you can Diane now say, well, there's nothing to write in. You guys don't own anything that doesn't. It doesn't happen in the real world.

### You (2025-12-02T22:52:38.879Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:52:52.718Z)

It'll be very expensive to go down that road and fight and Chantry Equity Court about, you know, what. What the agreement was and have the judge fill in the blanks for you guys and all that stuff. The reality is, to get him out, he is going to have to pay something, right? He's or he's not going to say, okay, I'll walk away for nothing.

### You (2025-12-02T22:53:10.399Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T22:53:11.838Z)

Never. He'll fight this to the end. Even if you get Drew to settle out. Mark will be the one with the deep pockets that he's got. Sounds like the deepest pockets. And if you wanted to be the biggest pain in the butt, Diane, you guys have the shallowness pockets. He's going to just bankrupt you guys in court. I mean, no, no if, ands or buts about it. And it won't even take him that much money to do it. Probably take him $100,000. And you guys would be default judgment and everything because you couldn't even afford to hang in that long to. To litigate a case. So we want to focus on now. Are they going to be treated equally? That's up to them. Like that's their side. Like they may propose. Drew gets his money back. Drew gets this and markets that, you know, and it may not be equal payments because they, on their side, they acknowledge that Drew has put more in. So maybe Drew gets, you know, 15,000, but Mark will pay you 7,500 a half that just to get you out of the thing. I mean, that is, you know. A likely scenario. The. The old adage is this. Whenever a case settles. The plaintiff accepts less money than they think they're owed, and the defendant pays more money than they think they should pay. No one is happy. If the settlement is good, no one is happy. Because. That's just the way it is. But everyone does that. Because they a It's a lot cheaper than litigating, and you don't want to throw your future into. The hands of a jury who has. Could have no clue in the facts of the law. And they're just like. I mean, the last patent. Chemical patent case I was. Last case I was involved with in court. Is a chemical patent case. Two global chemical companies in Delaware. Right. That's. We litigate Wilmington, Delaware. Federal courthouse in Delaware. Our jury for this case. Was eight women all over the age of 45. Zero college experience on any of them. Global chemical patent complex. The argument between cobalt, cobalt salt and this and that. The jury was out less than an hour and we got crushed. Because they don't understand it. So you never want to just throw your lot in with the jury system. You never. That's, like, the last thing you want to do. Plus, it cost them $4 million each on each side to even get to that point. Litigation is very expensive. We want to get this out quiet. And if you know, if. If you know. Like I said, worst case, it was 15 grand apiece. You pay it, you smile, you sign, and they're out of your lives forever. The other thing that they may ask for. And I don't know if they would. They want a cop, they may say, we want a copy of the source code that's been developed to date. Because we were all equal owners in that. So whatever's developed to date, They, you know, want a copy of it because they may want to try to create and get the market first. Well, that could be negotiable. And. But if at the end of the day that, let's say that happens. I don't think I would fear it that much because from what it sounds like, they. They couldn't do it in time. Like, Mark apparently is a Luddite and can't even work teams. So you don't have to worry about Mark jumping in and trying to coach something or even find a developer to code. And Drew's going to be busy running his own business on the side, too, so he's not going to be able to devote the resources to, you know, that you guys can, like the time and the effort and all that. So that may be something. But they may not ask for that. They may they may just say, don't use my data. The couple of. The. The one bit of leverage that our side would have. That if this would, you know, if they're threatening litigation. Is. And. And I don't know. What? Maybe it's nothing, but I think a sore spot could be. And I talked to Diane about this. If Drew gave you actual client data from his clients from home, hotel bis to use and test their PNL financial data, whatever data. He probably did so without the knowledge and consent of those clients. His contracts that he has with those clients. I would venture to guess, contain confidentiality clauses, contain a clause that you don't own our data, contain a clause that says you may only use our data for your business purposes, and he has used them for non hotel BIS purposes. That would all come out. His clients would be notified if you can identify which ones he gave you data for. And he's at risk because he has partners in hotel bids as well, and I don't think they knew what he was doing to the full extent that I don't know. Perhaps they should. Now, that being said, I don't want to ruin Drew's light. Right? Like, I want Drew to be happy and successful and go on and do his own thing. I don't want to be do what he's doing to me right now. I want, like. But I really don't think his partner. To trial. That's only if this would. If this doesn't get resolved, like, quickly and amicably. And they're going to force this because, like it or not, Diane, you need a lever point against them. If they don't feel like they have anything at stake, they get the free ride. And believe me, They have no compunction to worry about you. They will try to bear you. That's the thing that will be they. That's the goal for them, you know, once they lawyer up. This is the ugly truth of my life and what I've done for, you know, better part of 13 plus years is. Deal with these types of issues. But it's really, at this point, You once I call aaron. That attorney. You will never hear from that attorney again because all communications have to go through me. You should not have any communications direct with Mark Adrew. Everything should go through the attorneys, and we should just see if we can get this resolved as fast, as cheaply as possible. Who owns the IP I know you were talking about. We might have to get. Everyone says IP they have to identify what, like, are we talking the source code? InnVestAI, in my opinion, owns the source code. InnVestAI that was owned by five of you. So that's why I'm saying at the end of the day, if we had to, I would not fight providing them a copy. Everyone would have equal rights, like co owning a house. Everyone who co owns IP has equal shared rights to that ip. So if we're talking source code and stuff that was developed by Vinod's team for InnVestAI. I would say all five of you would have equal rights. Now they again, I'm not going to throw that out there. I'm going to let them ask for it. Like the source code stuff they may just want take the payout and leave. And that's it. Well, we tried, right? And that's it. And they'll go live their happy lives, and Drew will focus on Hotel Bis, and Mark will go do whatever Mark does. But. And they may not ever want to hear this again. But if we're talking that as ip. That is is what I would say. If we're talking about data. That Drew provided the test data. The letter says there was no agreements between the parties that Drew owns it. Fine, okay? We're giving it back. However, there's no trade secret violation either. Because the very letter that claims that you have no ownership in the IP because there's no agreements between the company and Mark regarding the data. Also means there were no confidentiality agreements. Between the company and Mark regarding any purported trade secrets that he's claiming now. And the biggest thing in a trade secret case is what reasonable measures do you take to protect your trade secret? Trade secret is the most vulnerable of all IPs. The only if you think of four major IP categories patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Trade secrets is the most. Could be the most powerful long because it has no expiration date at all. And you don't have to disclose it by its very nature, you disclose it to no one who doesn't need to know. Every one of the other three patent, trademark, copyright are disclosed. The federal government disclosed the people you know and they all have limited times. But trade secret is also the most fragile of those, because the moment it gets out, it's gone. You don't have a trade secret. And you have to take. You have to be vigilant about protecting your trade secret. And a trade secret owner disclosing a purported trade secret to a third party without a confidentiality agreement in place undercuts a trade secret misappropriation case big time. I mean, it just. It just is. And like I said, could open up Mark or not Mark drew to issues with you, misappropriated his client's data, and then Hotel Bis could get in trouble. So I don't think Mark is gonna. Or if I do this all the time with you guys, I don't. Think Drew, you can call broker data guy if you want to, if that helps to like, because we know who the broker and the data guy are. But if. If. I don't think Drew wants to broadcast to the world publicly what he did with the client data. So they. So when they say ip, they have to identify. What they mean by it. Like, that letter was nonsense. Like materials. You didn't identify one thing. Like, was it test data, test scripts, test videos?

### You (2025-12-02T23:03:38.639Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:04:05.278Z)

Source code. Like, how could you even comply with this letter? Technically, you could have said you identified anything. How can we comply? But that's why we're taking the super broad approach by let's just delete everything from the database, get rid of all their names, that's fine. Everything. And you can say, you're complying, but not deleting anything permanently. Just maintaining a backup, just in case. Once the settlement signed, then we can work out. Do you want us to send you the USB drive to the other side? You want us to just destroy and verify we destroyed it, you know, and go from there? But, you know, I would like to see. Pausing for one second, I just. Howard, just jump in here. I mean, you've been listening, so can you share your thoughts after you're hearing all this? Like, where's your head?

### You (2025-12-02T23:04:56.639Z)

No. I mean, a lot of this is really what I put in my email that, you know, it does not say what they're claiming, IP2 or what they provided. And, you know, if it comes down to, you know, who created what. The only thing that they created is pitch. Deck. PowerPoint deck. You know, Drew did provide the data. He stated at the time, don't let this out because this is coming from my client. He knew. He knew damn well what he was doing. Right. So that.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:05:33.598Z)

Bro. I didn't even know he told you that. But that's even better because now we know that would have. I'm sure that's peppered amongst all of us a little bit. So let's be careful with that a bit. Right? Because we all had to do some of that. He did. The most, because he was actually. But I was reaching back into some very old deal files as well. And I mean, technically. I mean, we're not recording this, right? So technically, I shouldn't have done that. So I don't want to get them in a position where they're counterclaiming to me and. They messed me up.

### You (2025-12-02T23:05:34.159Z)

So. Yeah, well, that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:06:07.038Z)

I mean, Drew provided the most because he was the one. I mean, if hard. Am I incorrect about that? I mean, please state if I'm. If I am. I mean.

### You (2025-12-02T23:06:13.519Z)

No, no. Yeah, no, he did provide pretty much all of the financial documents.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:06:17.118Z)

Should you?

### You (2025-12-02T23:06:21.999Z)

Mark and yourself provided sample models. Right. There's no IP claim on the models. The it's. Every model is the the same. You use the same formulas, you use the same data. To come up with evaluation. The only thing that's different is the layout. What's. What's on each tab, so, you know, I'm not at all concerned about that. So I guess, you know, the only thing that I found. You know, Mike, this is just as an FYI. I know the Internet is not an attorney, so I know not taking this. But what I. What I have found is that when it comes to code, What I found is that. The person or persons who wrote the code are the authors. So they would be considered the authors of the code. And specifically said, you know, feedback is not authorship. So any insights, suggestions, testing, anything else does not constitute authorship of the code. So, you know, that's, that's just one of the things, obviously, I can.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:07:39.358Z)

So you're correct. All ip, whether it's a patent, a copyright, anything. Someone at Disney or IBM. Any company in this world, from the largest to the smallest. All IP ownership originates with who created it.

### You (2025-12-02T23:07:51.759Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:07:57.198Z)

Every now, the fact that you guys have zero agreements with anyone. It hurts in some areas and may help you in others.

### You (2025-12-02T23:08:04.239Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:08:06.478Z)

Right now. Well, every. If I work for a company any like Disney, let's say, and I'm a animator or, or I work for IBM or Dow Chemical and come up with a new chemical formula. Every one of every employment agreement, even that I signed. The company I just came for has in it a provision that says all IP that you create while an employee of this company is rip. You agree to assign your rights to the IP to the company. So that's how companies end up with ownership of IP is because the employees are on the hook to assign their rights to the company. There's also a concept called work for hire, which if we pay you as a company to do something and it's only certain works, like artistic worker, there's a certain category of work, and I'm. And I don't know. If software falls in or not. It's like, forget it's been a while.

### You (2025-12-02T23:08:59.919Z)

I think. I think it does. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:09:02.798Z)

That means it's the company's property, not joblo coder's company if it falls. But you have to have a work for hire agreement. You guys have no agreement. So you know, technically InnVestAI doesn't even own the code, which is good in this aspect of you don't have the people who code or who created the code. And I'm not talking about the Indian developers or whatever, but they.

### You (2025-12-02T23:09:07.039Z)

Y. Eah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:09:31.438Z)

They're on your side, let's say, of the scale there. It's not like Drew has his own team that created. Because then you would never get it back. So that may cut against his rights to demand a copy of the code. Not to say it wouldn't.

### You (2025-12-02T23:09:38.559Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:09:49.438Z)

Be a point of discussion amongst it. Like, everything's on the table for settlement. Like, if it gets them out cheaper, it's up to you guys. Like, it'll be like, this is what they're asking for. They want to copy the code, but they only want $5,000 and they'll go. Away. You know, that'll be up to you. Like, do you want a pound on the table and say, no, we're not giving them the code. Then, you know, then it's, you know, back and forth. My goal would be ultimately to get this, like I said, resolved and final and to a confidential settlement agreement. That waives all claims against everyone forever. Up until the point of the settlement. Now, future. If you guys do something in the future with them that screws up that, you know, no one in the future ever. Right. But. So. But can I just stay for everyone on this call to hear is that I have learned my lesson and everything will be dotted with an I. And crossed with a T going forward. No loose flying on my part. I. I've committed to Howard that that is the way it is going to be and so maybe we can move to just another quick topic, which is we still do need to finalize the llc and it would be among the smaller group of people right.

### You (2025-12-02T23:10:31.039Z)

Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:11:10.398Z)

But we don't want to hold. Well, Howard, it's up to you. This is your decision, right? You're in Vanoa's decision. If I don't want to hold it up right, I'm happy to sign an llc. I can't quite say tomorrow because I work all day tomorrow. But as soon as humanly possible. I don't think you can. I don't think you can sign one until they route.

### You (2025-12-02T23:11:30.319Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:11:30.478Z)

Okay, I guess. Still they waive their rights. Otherwise, you. It's like you guys going off and just. Okay, unilaterally cutting them out of the. That they'll sue you for that. I mean, you can't do that. It won't be valid until they are out for good. Okay? Then you can worry about. Who's in, who's out. Come up with an another operating agreement. Okay, then that leaves us, though. We can still finalize the llc, right? It's in pretty good form. But it was. And I need to explain to you why the LLC exists in the form it does. And I hope you guys. The story will resonate with you. Sherben, when we first talked about the llc, you said something to me that resonated deeply with me. I was just going to take a form LLC agreement and get it signed so we could open a bank account. Right. I was. That's where my head was. And you said, Diane.

### You (2025-12-02T23:11:52.399Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:12:25.598Z)

Nobody will ever look at the LLC agreement again unless there's a problem. And that is, when you go to the llc, is to figure out how to resolve a problem. So practically. There were five of us. And you could already see the problems brewing. Right? That really settled deep with me and my, like, mind. Like, oh, crap. A simple LLC isn't going to work because we could have some really complex problems. So I sat down and I tried to think of every practical business problem that we could, like, hit. And I'm going to tell. One that hits very close to me is, I mean, Mike and I could go bankrupt like we are. Living on the edge. Right. And we have done a good job of trying to figure things out. But if we went bankrupt, that original llc, I think it said you guys could kick me out. And so then I just started to go through. And another thing was, well, Howard might want to, like, you know, leave the company at some. Point. Five, seven years in and do something else. Like, I. I know we've talked about our longevity, right? And you may want to stay, you may want to leave. So what's a fair and equitable way to allow a mechanism? And I just started to go through every problem I could think of. That's why. The LLC exists in the format it does. And I realize there's a lot of criticism of me that it's too complex, but I was really trying to think about a group where we were 20, 20, 20, 2020. It's not a good formula for success. And so we needed a robust LLC to be able to handle disputes. Now, that said and done, if we move forward, we don't sign the LLC right away, but we plan to sign it as soon as the settlement is done. Now we need to figure out what we want the LLC to look like. Do we want to take the form that was negotiated and just go with that? I mean, there are some work to do on things like, I never want to be in a position until luckily, if we ever get to a point where, and Howard has told me this, and I hear it very clearly, if we ever are lucky enough to get to a point where we're in a Series A investment, I could literally get kicked out of my job, Right? Like, they could say, no, we don't like you, Diane. We're replacing you, and that's it. But I don't want another coup to happen in the next couple of years because they. They literally. I just feel like they held me for ransom, and my. Ability to try to raise capital and move it forward over the last quarter. That does not mean it has to be, like, economic, like, like, like. But I feel like I just don't want to be in a position where I can have this coup idea happen again. I want to be as fair, I mean, always from the beginning, as fair as I can possibly be with the splits. But. But, Sherman, one thing is. I just want to introduce. The idea is five people was way too much. Four equal members is probably too much, right? Vinod says. He jokes around too many cooks in the kitchen. And we heard firsthand from Jessica Kramer that the original 2020, 2020 split would not be perceived well by investors, that they would not be able to see how we'd manage conflict resolution. There were just too many questions on how the partnership would actually function. And so those are things that we need to work through, and maybe we can be working through them while we're negotiating the settlement so that we're not delay so that when the settlement is agreed to, Howard and Vinod have complete confidence that you know, there's no more pushing off the llc, so I rambled there, but that's what I wanted to say. I agree. I think. I would say you might want to start over. Just because I think it got too complex. You're not going to account for every single. Possible outcome. You just can't. No one can foresee, like, what's going to happen. You want to cover the biggies, right? Exit. Like if. Like you said, if someone wants to leave voluntarily, how do you buy them out? Like, what is the. Who are they allowed to sell to? Who or who do they have to sell to? And what's the value? Most of it says I get an agreed valuation, but at the parties, can't agree to. Evaluation, then they're going to hire an independent valuation firm, and that's going to be the valuation.

### You (2025-12-02T23:17:06.079Z)

Rry.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:17:06.638Z)

The next one is how do you kick someone out who is not holding up their end of the bargain? Right? And, you know, and it's the. The big things like that. It's not like, you know, little. How do we resolve what we're arguing about, what the coach should look like? Like, that's. Not something that's going to the LLC agreement. And then you want to have, like, defined roles like this, like cfo. Right, Right. And this and, you know, a big picture stuff and, and so forth, and. And then you're going to have to learn how to delegate those roles. Right? Whoever the CFO is, is in charge, it should be your treasure. Right? So you have present. You have to have officers, and the officers are. Are not called cfo. See, you know, it's president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. You don't need to really. A vice president? We didn't have one of my company but we had a president and secretary and a treasurer. They all have the fine corporate roles under typically like what you could Google what a corporate secretary does takes minutes at the board meetings, responsible for the stock certificates. You know, if you have them, stuff like that. So. I would suggest, Diane, if you're going to be the CEO, you're definitely not the cfo, right? You're not the finance person. And whoever the CFO is is going to open a new bank account at their at a bank that they want. It's not going to be at Brex bank or wherever if it's your personal, but it's going to be represent my personal. It's in it's InnVestAI. Account, and I'm happy to turn all control over to a cfo For. For that matter, like, I'm happy to not touch it. You need, you're going to need a corporate credit card. Because just to pay for stuff like your QuickBooks, you can't even sign up for an Adobe license or a QuickBooks license or Microsoft 365 license. I mean, for what it's without a credit the one to recommend Brax as the best. How hard would you say this most flexible startup banking solution. So Brex didn't come out of my brain. It's not like it's bank of America. Howard and I had a conversation. I read about a bank. I mentioned it to him. He's been talking about Brax for months. And so, I mean, I trust Howard, and so I just did it. I mean, I just did it so that the money was sitting in an InnVestAI account. Right? So I don't. I mean, if you want to close if everyone was supposed that account and reopen another account, I won't totally fight you on it. I just want to make clear that Brux is a good bank for us to be using. And. And. Then every dollar in and out is accounted for in your QuickBooks. Every, every, every t cross, every answer. I gave you that list. If you would have just gone down the list. I know, and I take full responsibility, and I paid the price for it. I've learned my lesson, and I'm not going to do that going forward, everyone has my full commitment. But then let's just get going, figuring out what that means, how it works. Right. So that we're not waiting until the settlement is done. And then Howard and Vinod have less confidence that this is something that has real legs and can move forward. I want them to. Have. And, Howard, please jump in here. I'm not trying to over talk to you. I just. I'm trying to make sure you and Benoit have every bit of confidence you need that this is secure. It's locked down. It's what you want, it's what you agree to. I'm not. Flying fast. I'm not trying to work without you guys. So it was what you want? Tell me what you what you want here.

### You (2025-12-02T23:20:49.119Z)

No, I mean, I'm in agreement with what you said. You know? Basically myself and others said to you exactly what Mike said. You know, you cannot, absolutely cannot account for everything. That could potentially happen in the llc. And the LLC agreements all contain clauses of how to resolve differences of opinion. And you can. You can modify LLCs at any time. So, you know, and I know I'm speaking for Vinod as well, that we just have to keep it simple and not try to account for everything, you know, Song as long as the. How to resolve these issues are included in there, then that's what we need, and we can get that going, you know, as quickly as possible. But I agree that at this point, I don't think we can do anything. Until we have a, you know, the final settlement.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:21:50.318Z)

Even though get the LLC ready to be signed right after the sell, right.

### You (2025-12-02T23:21:53.119Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can. We can do that. Yeah, but we don't want to execute.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:21:55.678Z)

Okay. And so if that's the case, because I know I caused so much frustration around it, maybe, Howard, you should take the lead this time. And I'm not trying to put this on you. I mean, I'm happy to do it, but I think just because you may be able to solve the frustration points, that I created and start new work with Sherben. You guys figure out what the LLC should look like.

### You (2025-12-02T23:21:58.319Z)

It.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:22:20.878Z)

You know, my pain points. I don't want to be kicked out because I go bankrupt. And I never want to be in a position again where Drew and Mark can come and ask you guys to go against me and remove me from my here, here. And I think every standard LLC and you're not you're not going to like this, Diane, but every Citadel agreement has bankruptcy protection because it's not being trying to be mean to punish the person who went bankrupt.

### You (2025-12-02T23:22:26.479Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:22:53.678Z)

It's the protect the rest of the company that doesn't get pulled into your bankruptcy proceeding.

### You (2025-12-02T23:22:58.319Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:22:58.558Z)

Right. So you what happens would be. If someone goes bankrupt, I think the LLC agreement usually says they're bought out. They can take their pot of money. In as an asset to their bankruptcy proceeding. What they don't want, the company does not want to Happen Is this 20% interest or whatever, 40% interest. AI ends up tied up in bankruptcy court, where now we can. They can't even conduct business because the bankruptcy judge has to come up a point of trustee. Depending on what chapter bankruptcy you end up filing and if it's the point now that bankruptcy trustee owns 40% or whatever your percent of the company and has the full ability to liquidate the company and sell it and goodbye InnVestAI the other members of the llc. And it's not just InnVestAI it's any llc. Which is why most LLC agreements contain those provisions. They're not meant to be punitive, but if someone goes bankrupt, they're out.

### You (2025-12-02T23:24:02.479Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:24:07.998Z)

That's just how. Okay. And I'm just going to be like, we might need to find. I mean, I'm just. I have been so transparent about my financial situation, and my financial situation is in large part because of the five to six years I've spent working on this. Right. So every day I try to pull myself out. But this, this is it. Like, and I. This one I'm going to have to put, like, we're going to have to figure some solution around that. I'm saying there is no solution. When you go, and I hope this doesn't happen when, if you were to file bankruptcy, Then a whole new set of laws apply. You have no say in the matter. And if they think you're hiding assets or you have side deals or you're going to get hit with fraudulent transfer stuff and you're. They're still going to be able to claw it back and. And there's no way to do. That's what I'm trying to say.

### You (2025-12-02T23:24:55.679Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:25:06.718Z)

There are much, much smarter people than me and higher high powered bankruptcy lawyers who. People to try to hide assets or do side deals and stuff in bankruptcy court. The courts know that. And it's just maybe then let's just table this, because this is. I want to be. I want to be productive, and maybe I took us down a wrong route here, but I can feel, like, the tension radiating in my body. Maybe you're right, Sherben. I just need some time to think about it, and I need, like. I. I need to work on, I guess the settlement first because it's just the financial stress is overwhelming. And I just need to kind of, like, compartmentalize that. And it's overwhelming because that's part of being a startup. Right? A true, honest to God, scrappy startup means you live in fear almost every single day for your financial survival. We're not like. I mean, we're not rich guys from the Hamptons like creating a business. Nor are we young 25 year olds living in our Berends basement. So if we could just table this. I recognize and I hear what you're saying. What I want may not. You're telling me it's not an option. I just need to like sit with that for. A little while, if that's okay. Let's turn our attention back to the settlement and, like, trying to move in a constructive format to get through the settlement. And I will defer the LLC to you and Howard, but of course, we haven't gotten to the point yet where we've talked about what your economic role is in here. And I'm afraid. And I'm just trying to be very forthright, I'm afraid that we can't afford what your offer is because for you to come in as an equal partner to Vinod and Howard for two. For two reasons. One is the thing that I get scolded for over and over again is that I was so naive to do 2020, 2020 20. And I had been scolded for that over and over and over again. So now here I go and I'm repeating the same mistake again, right? So I'm very cautious of that. And I'M very cautious of the fact that, I mean, Benod and Howard. Howard has literally worked for a year, no pay on this. He has done the InnVestAI has been built on his back. Right. It's my relationships. It's what. It's kind of like what I've built from a business perspective. But the technology he built. And he spent an entire year working for no pay, full time on it while Drew and Mark flitted around and, I mean, Mark did nothing. And Drew complained that he spent 10 to 15 hours a week on it.

### You (2025-12-02T23:25:54.399Z)

Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:28:00.398Z)

So I'm just trying to express the reality of the situation is we want your help. I recognize all the value that you bring, but I'm not sure. Like a split? That is your equal share with Howard and Vinod. If you come in, I just want to be clear. Because you might not want to help us if that's the case. Right? You may say, this isn't what I want. I'm going to just. Thank you, Diane. I know we're friends. I'm going to exit stage right, go talk to a Delaware attorney. I mean, I think there could be a solution that's set where maybe things get bifurcated. Like the economic investment is treated one way with one type of percentage. Investing and then the contribution that you make as a fractional gc, which could be very. I mean, I think you're thinking of it, but there could be a lot involved when we get to having to negotiate contracts that involve AI and, you know, and like, SEC and stuff like that, plus potentially even the business part. Of our. Of our company is we involve and try to integrate with Harvey long term, but that maybe is like another percentage. Right, But. But I'm chiming in here, Howard.

### You (2025-12-02T23:28:44.079Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:29:23.198Z)

Again. I so over talk you. And I'm sorry about that. Can you just share your thoughts on this? Because we're partners in this and you have as much say as I do.

### You (2025-12-02T23:29:27.279Z)

Right. Right. Right. Right. No, I agree with what you're saying. I will say I only became aware of this earlier today. So really, I honestly hadn't had a chance to think about it. But I do agree that there's a lot of options. That we can. That we can work out. So, you know, some of them that you just mentioned are things that, you know, I hadn't considered, but they make a lot of sense. So. You know when I came. When I came into this.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:30:11.998Z)

Yeah, I would. I would say I'm open. I'm open to proposals. And I can't say that, you know, like you said, I wouldn't say band. Thanks, but I can't do it for. For this. You know, this offer, but I think. I would imagine it has to. I. I would think it would have to be done, or at least agreed to sooner rather than later, because. You're not going to know if you have any money to offer in a settlement. Exactly. Exactly. You know this happens.

### You (2025-12-02T23:30:47.279Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:30:47.758Z)

No, I. I totally understand that. So, you know, I don't want to call it right now. I'm representing you. If I'm not, you know, representing you, then, you know, so.

### You (2025-12-02T23:30:55.999Z)

Yeah, I think we can come up with something. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:30:56.878Z)

And I please don't take if. Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T23:31:02.639Z)

I came.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:31:02.798Z)

I mean, I, I, I completely understand and appreciate, you know, that in, you know, maybe it's not equal, but, you know, and Adam's going to make up off the top of my head, but maybe it's 35, 25, 25, 20 or something like that, I don't know. But I, I can't say it won't be like 10 or less. Like that is a non starter. So however you guys want to, you know, divide it up is fine. The other thing is, you guys are in a tough spot. I mean, you. You. You have no money. You have expenses. It's. And you're getting rid of the two. Your financial contribution. No, it's not even just me, but you know, it's like it. It. You got. It's. This is a tough. This isn't like scrappy Uber trying to start cuz those guys did live in their basement, right? I mean, we're you guys are have other obligations than living in your basement, which makes a financial strain more than just, hey, this is where scrappy startup like this is. I mean, what I would that really the toughest question is, is this the right time even like, do you guys need wives? No, I I'M going to just be very well. I can't speak for Howard. I can't speak for Howard, but I can speak for the hotel industry. And this is the exact right moment for a product like this to be delivered to the hospitality industry. It has nothing like it. It's Blue Ocean strategy. We should be. The first mover here. So in my opinion, is it the right time in my life? Well, it's never going to be the right time in my life. There's never a right time to do anything, but it's the right time in the industry. Now, I can't speak for Howard. Howard may say no, it's not the right time for him to do something like this. And if that's the case, well, then I have really big problems, right? Then I've got to figure a whole other solution out. And serving you probably will just want to exit completely, but. I'm sorry, Howard. I didn't mean to speak for you again. I know. I always do that.

### You (2025-12-02T23:33:10.479Z)

No, no. No, that's fine. So, Mike, let me just take a day to come up with a plan. I can guarantee you we'll work it out. You know, when I came into this, I know that there was going to be dilution. It was never just going to be an even 20% across the board. And, you know, we walk away with everything. There's always going to be dilution from investors. There's going to be dilution from key employees. You know we have to set aside a pool for them. So, you know, I, I I'm not going to lose any sleep. Over that. I mean, even if I.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:33:49.358Z)

Intervention. In fairness, I'm not upset about my economic share, right. Because I believe this is going to be big. I right now am playing Mama Bear to Vinod and Howard because I did not protect them well enough over the past six months and I let Mark walk all over us. And I'm not saying you're going to do that, right? But I feel like I didn't do my job. And I value their partnership to the end. All of the earth. And I just want to make sure. And if Howard is okay with it.

### You (2025-12-02T23:33:52.879Z)

Right? Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:34:24.398Z)

I'm going to be okay with it. And if I can see a power okay with it, I'm going to be okay with it. I just want to make sure. Part of my role, Diane, is I'm trying to protect you from you.

### You (2025-12-02T23:34:25.439Z)

Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:34:35.518Z)

You have not run this business at all like it should be. And, like, think operationally, not product stuff, not hotel stuff, just. Nuts and bolts running any company is a baby that don't drastically I acknowledge it and I'm trying to fix it and sometimes I feel like I get and just please I get I've gotten scolded so much over the last six months but try to remember the good things that I've done too. Everyone hates this Driftwood Safe Note, but this Driftwood Safe Note is generating some revenue for us right now and it could be good in the next couple months if we can start testing with them. So I just please remember I do good too, right? Maybe I did play to 100. I played too loose. I should have followed your schedule. I take full responsibility for it. But honestly, being accused of fraud like. That, like, I feel like that's penalty enough for me. And so I will follow all the rules going forward. If you have my complete commitment on that, just maybe hold off on the scolding of me for a bit, if that's okay. And you know that I've said from the beginning that's just bluster on there for. You did not commit fraud in this situation. But anybody would be freaked out if they in, like, if that leaks out into the industry. That is devastating to me. Right? So. And it's just devastating to me that I get Mark. I get Mark saying that I just drew blue. It blows my mind that he said that. And so that's why I say if. It they start.

### You (2025-12-02T23:35:55.679Z)

There was.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:36:16.558Z)

Blabbing and throwing around you committed fraud, then that's a defamation lawsuit on their hands. Like, that's. Yeah. They can't just badmouth you and ruin you in the industry by stating facts. The third part. That's libel. That's slandering. That's defamation for sure. And so. Now, let's just come back to the points, right? Which is one.

### You (2025-12-02T23:36:21.279Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:36:38.558Z)

Let's believe that something still exists here. Howard is the most reasonable person I've ever met in my life. And so I. Again, my economic. Like I'm not. Like I always was fine with 20%, because in my mind, 20% of a big thing is still a lot of money. I want Howard and Vinod to feel good about it. And so Howard reasonable and he'll come to you. We Hear your statement. 10% is too little. Let's talk about X, Y and Z. All good. I will follow to the letter of the law the way you guys want the organization to be run. I started. T's crossed I might not be the right person to do all of that. That should probably be in the hands of a cfo, like you say. But if we could just. I mean, for me, because I'm trying to keep it together during the situation. If we could just move through positive steps to get this resolved, get to a solution, get Howard and Van Oak comfortable, get you turban. Comfortable. And if we can stabilize this situation, I am confident I can go raise 4 to 500,000 in additional safe investments from hopefully companies that are in our business that can help us try to bring this to market. I have, here's what I would suggest for stuff. And, and lastly, my interest is economic, so I don't have, I don't need, like equal voting rights. Right. So that if that sets your mind at ease, like, you know. Yes, it does. Like I could have non voting shares. It's, it's really mine is just purely dollars and you know, because I'm not gonna. If I'm. If, like I said, I view my role as. CFO general counsel. Just like I said, the non product, non hotel. So just the business stuff. Like just keeping everyone in line from a business compliance standpoint and knowing when we need to get outside counsel when we need to. Like if it comes time for Series A and we have to file SEC filings, that will be handled by a securities lawyer or something like that. But the all the product, all the data, all the testing, Yes, I have software experience, and if you want to ask me, in my opinion, I'll be happy to give it, but I don't need a say in how you guys do that. And I'm hopefully Diane gonna relieve you of some of that burden of trying to keep track of the money in this and, you know what needs to be done for this. Just focus on the product is really in the schedule. That enraging capital. That would be to try to take some off your plate. But immediate steps, I would say, right? Let's revise it. Let's revise the letter you sent.

### You (2025-12-02T23:39:19.519Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:39:30.558Z)

And it'll be a short revision. Like I said, for the most part it was great. I would just add in. You're gonna also in the process of deleting all the data after backing it up for preservation purposes from the database. You are in any other data that drew it provided. You're gonna send you the letter, and it's not quite right. Will you just read? Yeah. And then just send it back to me. And how I include Howard on that email. I will then call the attorney this week. So if you. If we get the letter out today. Tomorrow. I'm sorry. I have to work at the hour of six tomorrow, so I will get it done after work tomorrow. Okay, so we sent out tomorrow. That's what, Wednesday? Let's say Thursday or Friday. I'll give him a call. Just hopefully, you know, I get his voicemail, and I'll just give him my phone number and say, hey, we're willing to work out a resolution. What are your clients proposed and hopefully he calls me back with the proposal. In the meantime? Well, after the letter goes out, and while we're waiting for the back and forth communication between me and their lawyer, nothing is stopping you guys from creating a new operating agreement for the llc. I would say keep it as simple as you can, as we can always amend it later and provide in the whatever draft you have that amendments to this agreement, you know, have to be in writing and agree to by whoever, how many voting shares or whatever. That's fine. So it's a catch all. So it's not locked in stone forever so you don't have to be. You know, paralysis by analysis. That's got to be perfect at the first go and then. But just take care of big things. Exits and terminate again. Voluntary push offs. And what happens if someone gets like the force or dies or what? Because you don't. Want to be in business with someone's spouse, ex spouse, or, you know, and that's all standard stuff. You could probably ask Chat GBT to drop the basic operating agreement under Delaware law, and whatever it spits out is going to cover 95% of what you need without even changing it, probably and then include, you know, a cap table or, you know, with the shares. And you could have one for voting shares, one for non voting shares or whatever. And then let me jump in there and then Howard and Vinod will talk. I'm gonna go with whatever. You guys agree with Howard, so, I mean.

### You (2025-12-02T23:40:56.239Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:42:12.398Z)

You got. You let me know on how you what you want to propose to Sherben. I'm not going to be difficult on this. And you'll do that in the next, what, 24, 48 hours, couple of days.

### You (2025-12-02T23:42:18.319Z)

Yeah, yeah. That's fine. I'm going to shoot off an email.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:42:26.638Z)

I don't think it doesn't need to be that fast. It's going to take us at least two weeks. At least. And it would be fast. It was two weeks to work out a settlement with them. And we're not going to be all the, you know, sign any operating agreement, new one, until they're out. So. But so he doesn't have to have a draft tomorrow or this week or, you know, so there. There's time.

### You (2025-12-02T23:42:32.799Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:42:48.798Z)

And I would really, just for. At least for the next week or so, just put on hold. Anything you can for InnVestAI like you don't, your data is going to be gone. So it's, you know, it's not like you're going to be. You don't want to create more. If it ends up as part of the settlement, you have to give them a copy, the source code. So I would almost freeze it where it is, because anything new, you don't want to give them a head start. You want that for yourself. Technical work on the software, though, right? Because we are having some preliminary conversations with Mark Woodworth about.

### You (2025-12-02T23:43:18.559Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:43:24.958Z)

Trying to resurrect a benchmarker product, and I see this as like a new strategy for us. I don't want to stop those conversations. They're the very. No, you could still still have that, but just conversations are fine. Just be wary of how much you create in case you have to until they're out, assume they have an equal ownership share in whatever you guys are creating. So conversations, planning is fine, but don't create anything that you're going to have to turn over to them.

### You (2025-12-02T23:43:49.759Z)

Development is paused. Yeah. Right. So development is paused. I have zero concerns if they demand the. If they want the source code. And the reason is because the source code is far from being complete. So what they would end up with is, you know, a start. And I can guarantee you neither one of those guys. Would know what to do with it. They would have to bring on somebody else. Go with it in the meantime. You know, what we do need to finish would be done very quickly, so no concerns there. So let's. Let's just follow Mike's direction. Let's just continue with conversations. We can continue with anything other than writing code. We'll go down that road.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:44:45.998Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T23:44:47.439Z)

I'll. I'll get with Node. I'll put together, you know, a reasonable distribution and. And, Mike, I'll make sure that you've got an acceptable solution. To this. It does ease my mind when you mentioned about, you know, looking for the economic. Because I've been sitting here droning numbers. As we're talking. And I was thinking, yeah, you know, I would probably be. My first offer would have been, you know, non voting. Shares, and you've already taken that off the table, so I think we're good there. But, yeah, I think we're good. And I apologize. I do have to drop here. But, yeah, let's just. Let's just go ahead and reply to theirs. You know, my. My main interest is seeing what they are looking for financially. I really like the idea that was brought up earlier about dividing it by five. You know, that brings the amount of, you know, the. The money on the table down significantly.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:45:48.238Z)

In my hand, in my minds, that's. That's the most that. I mean, like, if they can't demand more than that, because where's the, the value? And there's a, There's a concept in law. You can't get speculative damages. Like, so they can't say, well, this. Is a hundred million ideas. So we'll settle for 50 million. They'll get laughed out of court. And so what is the real value of this? And if I'm looking at this and I you know, my other my day job is buying companies on behalf of employees for employee stock ownership plans. If I'M looking at this company and I'm like, the only cash in revenue you have is 75,000, and you have expenses and really zero profit.

### You (2025-12-02T23:45:52.799Z)

Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Y. Eah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:46:29.598Z)

There's really no. There's no value to this company. And so to come up with any value that would, you know, at the most that they could ask for, I'm like, okay, let's forget. Let's say the 75,000 is all profit. One fifth of that, your share is, you know. 15,000 each. That's it. So there you go. Like, we're giving you everything, the gross off the top number before any expenses. But that's not going to be our starting position. And I want them to hopefully be reasonable in their first offer. At least reasonable enough that I can see a light like, yes. This is going to result in a, in a settlement. That's, that's clear. Because before I did this, like I said, I was a litigator, and 99% of cases settle, they don't go to trial. So I have lots of experience in negotiating settlements and litigation cases.

### You (2025-12-02T23:46:57.999Z)

Right? Right. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's good.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:47:25.358Z)

Howard, can I ask one other favor as a next step, and you can say no to this, but would you be comfortable shooting off a quick email to Mark Woodworth and just, I don't know, something along the lines of, I know you talked to Diane. You know, sorry that you're, you know, that you know. You're getting caught up in some of this. We have a plan to resolve it, or however you want to say it, but something that puts his mind at ease. That it's not just me saying this, but you're there as well saying it.

### You (2025-12-02T23:47:56.079Z)

Yeah. Let me just. Let me see what I can put together.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:47:58.318Z)

Okay, thank you.

### You (2025-12-02T23:47:59.839Z)

Whether it comes directly from me or I go send it to you, like, here's my thoughts, and then you forward it. I mean, we can. We can.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:06.478Z)

Yes, Just something so. Because he's heard me. Right. But he was impressed by you. And so if I can show him that you feel like this is all resolvable and that it needed to happen, which I think you agree, right? Like, I couldn't have moved forward with Mark.

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:09.839Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It's. It's just a bump in the road. Honestly.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:28.078Z)

Right. And if he could just hear that from someone other than me, I think it gives him great relief because he's having some pretty serious conversations with CBRE over the next two weeks.

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:33.119Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:39.358Z)

And I just don't want him to get scared off by this.

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:39.759Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:43.438Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:43.999Z)

We'll see what I can put together.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:45.998Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:46.319Z)

All right, Mike, thank you very much. If you need any other information, reach out, but. Yeah, I think. I think we're good. I think we're okay.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:54.478Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-02T23:48:54.639Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:48:55.998Z)

Diane, I'm mark up the letter you sent yesterday or today. Oh, that would be a huge. And then I'll send that to you, and then you don't have to send me for something to mark it up. I'll just mark it up this one. And I'll just reply to that email that you sent. Okay, great. All right, guys. I appreciate it. Yep. We'll talk to you later.

### You (2025-12-02T23:49:14.559Z)

Okay? All right, thanks.

### Guest (2025-12-02T23:49:18.078Z)

Okay, talk to you later. Bye.
