# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### You (2025-09-23T21:31:04.563Z)

Hey. Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:31:07.522Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-09-23T21:31:08.403Z)

How are you?

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:31:11.122Z)

How are you? Hi, dan. Hi. Carrie, thanks for joining us. All right. Hello. Hi there.

### You (2025-09-23T21:31:22.803Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:31:25.682Z)

And so Vinod and Drew, not the node. And Mark cannot join tonight. Mark because of the Jewish holiday. And I think Beno just had good notes around yesterday or today that were really positive about the data extraction.

### You (2025-09-23T21:31:43.043Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:31:46.162Z)

And. I carry yet. So, Carrie, nice to meet. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Yeah, we haven't met yet. We've been working closely on the marketing side. I can do an introduction, if that helps. Yeah. Yeah, please. I'm Carrie. I've been working with Howard on the brand and marketing side. Just starting off with the logos. And so Howard and I met rediq. I was there working, doing product marketing there. But big picture. Like, I'm here to make sure you've got the right story and materials for investors and clients. And I'm just really excited to finally meet you all and get aligned ahead of Phoenix. Cool. Right now. You were a company called Ink Inc. Well, it's startup as well and anyone everyday writers can go on our platform and write stories and if it does well, we'll create a show out of that and then the earn royalties in that sense. Ldr. That's cool. And that's great to write it made to interrupt, but I know. Then, Mark, we're. Tossing management. So it's complimentary or similar to what we're doing here, which is more transaction acquisition levels. I look forward to working. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Thank you. I know. I'm just joining the first 15 minutes of this call. So first, I do want to go over the logos. I refined number three based on the feedback. And explore some more modern, inspired directions since a few of you guys mentioned you guys wanted something that feels more tech AI and less real estate developer. And I don't want to spend all the time on design options right now, so I'll just give a quick look at the updates, then I'll send the files around after this call so you can drop your comments directly there. That way I can take in everyone's feedback together instead of rushing it through here. So I'm going to share my screen. For just the first draft. Let me know if you guys can see this. The PDF that I sent Howard, and it looks like this is the third logo that you guys are really interested in. Sorry. Can you guys see my screen? We can. Yes.

### You (2025-09-23T21:35:06.163Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:35:20.242Z)

Iteration. Of the design logos. That number three was what the team was favoring over this logo. And then you guys also really like the colors of this. For the third iteration with the two colors. Not too drastic of a change. Of a change. I didn't want to get the initial feedback from you guys. And just like initial reactions, Like, what do you guys think? I also have a few other options here. That doesn't really have the hotel, but it has kind of the arrow to show that it's towards a life cycle. Investment. And then Howard also sent me some local concepts, and this is what I came up with as well. Yeah. But any question for the group? Does this feel like I'm moving closer to the modern AI look you guys had in mind, or should I push it further in another direction? The node. Are you on or did you drop? No, I'm still here. I like the first option you showed with new colors. I think the colors are really looking good in that one. If you could scroll back up a little, that would be great. Ok. The first. The first, yeah. Second iteration of the previous logos you had created. Wherein? Yeah, if you can scroll up, I'll stop when you see it on the screen. Yeah. So this one. Yeah. So you created another option of this. Yes. If you want to show that. The color look very dominating. Yeah, this. This looks color. I really like the color. I mean, if we could do something of that. Building icon, right? It still looks very bulky. If that somehow that would be great, but. Yeah, I like in this one. What do you mean by sleek? Is it the color? No, it's the icon on the. To make it maybe just a little thinner or. It looks great. Colors look great. But the thicker text, I think, could also be a way to sleek. It's like I got a slightly thinner text. Okay. Thinner text. So thinner logo and bolder text. The boldness of the text is great. It's just maybe the font is what I'm talking about. Like, maybe a thinner font, if that makes sense. So kind of thinking about how Elise AI their font. I mean, if you went back and looked at the way that they're font fuels, it doesn't have to be, obviously, that we don't want to copyright or copy what they're doing, but it might be, like, inspirational to understand. The font gender that I'm talking about. Yes. Yeah, okay, I can do that. Before we go on, though, I just Mark Drew Howard. I mean, I don't know. Benoit and I just dominated that. Honestly, I think this is great the way it is. Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T21:39:15.043Z)

And my screen is frozen. I'm still looking at the last one she showed. I'm not sure what's going on, so I may actually log off and log back in. I hear everything and I see everybody's camera, but for some reason, her presentation. Is. Like 10 minutes behind.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:39:40.002Z)

I'll be sending the second draft of Logos as well after Paul. Feel free to drop your feedback there as well.

### You (2025-09-23T21:39:42.403Z)

Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:39:49.202Z)

But another thing I want to talk about was since Phoenix is right around the corner, I want to make sure we don't lose sight of the one pager. I feel like the most urgent piece to have ready for Mark. And I want to get it right. So I need a little input from you all. Like, who's the main audience? Mark, you'll be talking to Phoenix. Is it investors, potential clients, or mix? Second. What is the first number one outcome you want from the conference? Is it raising awareness? Is it pitching for investment? Are we lining up for Beta clients? And third, do you have any past one pagers or compare examples. You like that I can use. So for inspiration. Yeah, the audience is really. Sorry. Yes audience is really all above. I circulated at some text. To yesterday and today. Hopefully, we'll have. You. But, yeah, the audience is really just generally speaking to build awareness of what we're doing.

### You (2025-09-23T21:41:05.443Z)

So, mark.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:41:07.042Z)

But it could be users, it could be investors.

### You (2025-09-23T21:41:07.923Z)

Yeah. What do we want her to do with the text? Are we looking for an infographic like was discussed? Or do you want her just to make it just. The written text that we provide.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:41:22.882Z)

Yeah. I mean, I don't think that we need an infographic. I don't think that our audience is really. I think we just need a concise explanation of what we're doing. Unless you guys disagree. I just think it's just fact based. It would probably be the most effective. Mark. What if we can't get all that under one page? Would you rather have something that is more like a brochure that's two or three pages? Or would you prefer to keep it to one page with some sort of link to a bigger infographic, Silver or something like that? Yeah, no, I'd love to keep it to one page. I purposely tried to be concise so that we could make a one page, and I think less is more. So I think it's a good discipline to have one page. Just to give people a concise understanding, but I also think it would be helpful. If we could, and we touched on this last week. Try to expand our web page. So hopefully whatever goes on this one pager could also be translated to our website so that we could. Because right now we just have a placeholder up. And hopefully over the next number of weeks to months. People will start trying to go to our site. And it'd be good to sort of have a little bit more of an explanation up there as well. So I'm hoping that we can multipurpose this exercise.

### You (2025-09-23T21:42:54.163Z)

Do you want any screenshots or any type of graphic on there? Because I'm wondering if it's. I mean. If we just hand them a piece of paper with text on it, is it going to catch their attention? Are they going to read it? I mean.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:43:10.642Z)

Well, again, I don't know what we have available at this time in terms of graphics or some of these specific two are platform. So I think for now you can have a narrative and then we can add to it as it evolves. Yeah, so I can also draft a skeleton version for you guys to pick from. So you can also react to in the next call if you guys like. But I guess who should I expect or follow from one theater information? Is it new Mark, or. I'm just waiting for thoughts from the team. I'll probably do one consolidated version. I'm sorry, but I'm good with. You wrote I did not share how to fit it all into one page. But I'm not the creative person of this team. So I'm sure between you and Carrie, you can figure out what you want on that. Did anyone else? Drew, Howard, Benoit? Did you guys have any comments on the text Mark wrote, or are we just good to let Carrie go with it?

### You (2025-09-23T21:44:23.043Z)

Yeah, no, I. I already gave them feedback as well. What he put on there is on one page.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:44:26.882Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T21:44:34.243Z)

With quite a bit of space in between. That's what I'm wondering is how we want to lay it out.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:44:40.242Z)

I did. I did cheat. I had to reduce it from a 12 point font to an 11. But once. I'm sorry, Carrie. I don't mean to steal your creative moment, but that was my little inspiration to produce the font size. No worries. No worries. Okay. I think that's all I have. Anything for me? I think I'll just be following up with Mark and also. I see Drew to draw. You are on mute. Yeah, we can use it on. The middle. Right. So, like, we've talked about. And this is just I made the I just literally consider second it would create. But it's like a circular. Component that shows, like closing. Disposition, right? Or some three components of the asset lifecycle. Then branches coming off of that, like the core features that support each thing, right? So underwriting, like, automated underwriting, you know, workflow. Appraisal, lender financing. Right. Like all the various things that our platform is going to do and the ways that it supports customers. And then in the middle, you could have, you know, Investor, lender, broker, appraiser. Right. The primary users would be in the middle or something like that. That's kind of what I was thinking as, like, again, like an infographic. What would we use that for? It'd be something that, you know, pictures be kind of the idea that pictures are worth more than words, right? So you like taking the content of what you put in the. In that document? In the one pager. But rather than have somebody, you have to read all of this, they can. We could. Convey the same information. Visually, Right? So with an infographic. Yeah, I agree with Mark. Infographics definitely help users understanding what the product is and how it works. Be able to use it. Or we could even say, you know, distribution. We could say, I don't know. And then from here, there would be things coming off that it's like, you know, underwriting, tracking, loan covenants, you know, broker. Right. Like, all the things. Right. And so it's just that way, it captures or conveys to those that we give it to very quickly, like, oh, you're building something. Support the entire, you know, investment or asset management lifecycle. Of, you know, for hotels and we could have are the kind of the tagline at the top InnVestAI What are. You know, that's kind of what I was thinking as far as like an infographic.

### You (2025-09-23T21:48:54.963Z)

Yeah. I mean, we could put, like, whichever logo we decide on maybe in the middle of that, and have the things coming off, like you mentioned. I think that'd be a good idea.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:49:05.922Z)

Yeah. And you, or you. And you could have something on the side here that says, you know, Personas or user types, you know, owner or investor, lender, broker, manager, etc. Just. Just taking the same information that's in what Mark has of putting it in. So it's, you know, very visual.

### You (2025-09-23T21:49:24.003Z)

So for. For Mark's conference. What I'm thinking now that I see this. Is. Excuse me. You know, take the text that he wrote, have it on one side of the page, and then have something like this on the. On the other side of the page. So, you know, not two pieces of paper to hand out, but maybe a single piece of paper that they could go with.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:49:52.002Z)

Yeah, in all likelihood, I'm. I'm probably going to have conversations with people at the conference.

### You (2025-09-23T21:49:55.363Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:49:57.282Z)

And then do a follow up email with them and send them this graphic just.

### You (2025-09-23T21:49:58.723Z)

Okay? Okay, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:50:03.042Z)

Because in my experience, people don't want to have a piece of paper to carry around. They just. So I think it'd be more effective to have a discussion and then do a follow up kind of a day or two later.

### You (2025-09-23T21:50:11.603Z)

So does. Does this conference have, like, a trade show floor or anything with other vendors that are going to be there? Right. Right. Right, but that's. That's what I'm wondering is if. If we had some type of.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:50:21.202Z)

Sponsors who pay for so I'm going.

### You (2025-09-23T21:50:27.123Z)

Handout or something like that. That would be. That they could take. But, yeah, you guys do whatever you think.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:50:34.162Z)

You know what I do think, though? Like, what saying is that? Because a lot of people. Who's going to be talking to our people, he knows. And if we're cons, if we're, if we're really good with our time.

### You (2025-09-23T21:50:40.563Z)

True. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:50:46.002Z)

We. I think we can get the content for a website together and probably seven days to build, like, by next week. At this time, Drew, Mark and I could agree on the content of what we want on the website. And then it takes to build the website. But it could be in a good condition for mark descendant as a follow up a week after or two weeks after the conference. Right. With the full website built out. I mean, what does the team think of that idea? Okay, I think that that's a good idea. I do think that there's certain. I would like to send it out, you know, a day or two after the conference. I don't want to wait all week. I think we're fresh in people's mind. It's good to kind of refresh their memory. I just want to make sure. Can we get something? Can we? Because you, Mark, you want to send a link to the website too, right? Well, ultimately, I mean, I think that having this one pager is a good first step, but I think ultimately, if we could put the first page or something like it on the website, right? With the same information. Because I think it's good to have the same talking points. At least initially, until we kind of expand our offering. So just trying to multipurpose the same argument if we can. So can we get a website done in two and a half weeks? Yeah, yeah. All right. Just making sure.

### You (2025-09-23T21:52:07.523Z)

We're, what, two weeks out from there? If it's on the 6th, so, yeah, we don't have a lot of time.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:52:15.522Z)

Yeah, but I need, like, the content.

### You (2025-09-23T21:52:15.923Z)

Right, right. Yeah, I know, I know. Actually, putting it up on the website, you can work your magic fairly quickly, but, yeah, need to get that ready to go.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:52:28.642Z)

And Carrie, if we needed help, like, if. Because the node is really great with, like, the UI piece on the website. But if we needed help with more visualizations and like's very good. Like Punchy. He's the best. But if we did. I can definitely help with more of the graphics. I think if you go. If you guys do it using art of creating a website, It should. It should be easily to get up and running very quickly. The story is very adhesive, so you guys can tell your brand. I think another thing I want to bring up. Is the mvp ready? Or is it still in the work? It is still in the warp. We are kind of moving towards the readiness.

### You (2025-09-23T21:53:45.603Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:53:47.042Z)

It's getting there. So there's probably going to be a demo version of the mvp. That's very. I mean, it's going to be very basic, but let's just say it's ready by midday late October. And then what we're hoping is to find a beta or a client to help us. Get from there to a finished product. That the first version is targeted towards lenders and appraisers because they're at the highest level of underwriting, and we think we have the best shot. At monetizing the first version. Of InnVestAI at a high level, underwriting with that group of customers. And so what we'll be looking for is to try to get. I'll call it a beta client. I mean, they could be revenue, it could be investment in the company. But on board October, November, so that we can start working with them. If this makes sense, to get their actual real world feedback in what they want. In the final MVP, which would go to a V1. But we're kind of in our time frame. We're thinking that that would be done. In Q1 like it would take us until Q1 to get all their comments and feedback incorporated in it.

### You (2025-09-23T21:55:09.923Z)

So, Carrie. Carrie, going back to the website, I. I do believe.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:55:11.842Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-23T21:55:14.883Z)

That the node and the team have made enough progress so we can start getting some basic screenshots. You know, to show some of the layout, few things. You know, we wouldn't want to have it blown up on the screen, but if we could have something there. But I think first we have to decide on the logo. So that, you know, when we do grab some screenshots, if we can have the new logo. In there. That'll definitely help. But yeah. I mean, it's not going to be much. We don't need to show every single page and every single feature. If we just had, you know, the home page and a couple other screenshots. That, you know, maybe you can just tile them or something along those lines. I think we can provide that. For you.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:56:05.602Z)

When you guys do have the demo, can I also take a look at it? Maybe sandbox, if possible.

### You (2025-09-23T21:56:10.243Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:56:13.282Z)

Absolutely. Ok? Where are you based? I'm sorry, I forgot to ask that. You are in what city? I was in California, in San Francisco. Ok. Oh, you're in San Francisco. Awesome. In the midst of it all. Yeah. I think I was left to introduce myself to you. I think you already know everyone. So I am vinod. I am into software engineering and I have worked with Howard previously. We'll kind of help in similar platform for share Hatha group of companies called Bradia. And now I'm kind of leading work here with Investi. Nice. Ok. Ay where we were also at Rediq. I don't think we worked together when we were at rediq, but we never walking closely with marketing groups.

### You (2025-09-23T21:57:04.323Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:57:19.282Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I was working more closely with Cassandra and Payton. And customer success and sales team. But it was nice to meet you all. I will send over that logo for. Mark, when should I expect to hear back from you? Is maybe end this week. No, it should be in your email box. Right now. Ok, I'll check.

### You (2025-09-23T21:57:44.083Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:57:45.842Z)

Yeah. Thank you so much. It was nice meeting everyone.

### You (2025-09-23T21:57:46.163Z)

Yeah, thanks. Carrie. Okay, thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:57:51.042Z)

Bye. Bye. All right, guys, I actually have to drop now. I might be on audio for a few more minutes. But please do check the email. I send you some testing work. Yes. Right. You guys got your good results and the debt extraction, right? Yeah, yeah, go ahead. And I put it. I did test out your, like what you sent. I went through the steps. And it populated. It looked good. How do you want us to give you feedback? Because it pulled data. I used the full cno, cnyo, whatever property, that property in New Orleans. So it's the full year file with 12 months of data, and it pulled the data in the March. Like it pulled the data from March as opposed to the full year, but it got all the rows right, which is, I think, probably more difficult, or I'm assuming anyway, which is good. I don't know where this number came from. I don't think these things add up. But anyway, I wanted to know, how do you want us to get your feedback? Yeah, if you could just put all the details or whatever. You found out what file you uploaded. What was not working correctly. That would be great. Then that will save us some testing employee.

### You (2025-09-23T21:59:41.363Z)

The node. Would you like to have a video?

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:59:43.522Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T21:59:44.243Z)

With screen recording or.

### Guest (2025-09-23T21:59:51.842Z)

Details and email both are fine. Yes. Okay? I will do that. And Drew. Did you hear back from Remitley? Is the transaction completed now? I don't think Raj has received that payment yet. It should be there tomorrow. All right.

### You (2025-09-23T22:00:15.043Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:00:16.162Z)

Guys, thank you very much. All right, thanks. Let me go in here. By the way, just as a side note, my cousin. Works for Citigroup, and he does their. I guess their video work. And they have him full time working on Instruct Ional videos. To send to all the Citigroup executives. Teaching them how AI should be their friend and how they can use it in their daily workflow. To make their jobs more efficient. That's his full time thing, though. He says he does this like 20 hours a day. Just for the Citigroup executives.

### You (2025-09-23T22:01:04.403Z)

Yeah, nice.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:01:04.802Z)

So I asked him to send me one of his examples, but. Anyway. That's so interesting. How did he get that gig? But they kind of shifted his responsibilities, really, to just AI instructional work to try to educate the older bankers on how AI can do their friends and how they could really integrate it into their workflows. That's so funny. Leave them walk said something similar. I don't know if they're doing videos, but it's all big Education rollout on Harvey to teach the they first started with senior attorneys. And they wanted to the junior associates, and I just was just interesting. The junior associates are apparently freaking out a bit about how they're gonna available hours if they use AI for the work. So they wanna make sure that the training gets included in the count the billable hours. But it's really just. I mean, it's really a lot of. And a lot of training within Latham Watkins on how Harvey's gonna impact their business. And the amazing thing to me is just the speed in which it's all happening. Yeah. All right. So let's go back agenda of things that we are working on. So I am not a chance to do it on the operating agreement. Diane. Is that something? I send out, I'm gonna go back and send out the language that we're missing on Buy, Sell, whole drag along stuff like that, which we're missing. And then go through. We put our roles in a table. But see if we can expand that a little bit more. And then major decision making. Because I think if we do those three things, then we'll be in a better position to get the LLC finalized. Okay, well, also, I have notes from. Oh, you do? Okay. If you want to send them over to me. Do I know Howard shared some things, too. But send everything you have. It won't be until Saturday that I can get it done. But that's the time I'm blocking to do that. Okay? Yeah. So we have that template. I put that on. Our shared drive, I think. That. It's filled out such now that you send it to Carlos. I'm gonna do that tonight. Okay? Okay, so regarding. Interest. I don't. People would react to that. Driftwood is more than enough. They are actually more. But. I'll acquire about that? That's a good question. What do we have a paraphrase? I mean, do you think that's what's best? I would have the preference of driftwood only because drift will people know who driftwood is in the industry, right? And so when you look at Revere and who they listed as their initial capital investors, It resonated very strongly. Backing. Does that make sense? Individuals. It was all communities. It's driftwood capital advisors, I think. So maybe that's a different division because I just typed Driftwood Hotels and Driftwood I was selling. Management came up as their. Try Driftwood Capital, Driftwood Capital Advisors. Something along that line. Yeah. So they have Driftwood Capital, which is defined as a commercial state investment platform. So I guess they earn divisions. Right. And it would be that entity, if it's any entity, that would be. That would be better than the management. Entities sell better in terms of other potential management company investments. Yes. Okay, great. Regarding budget and finances. I sent something to you in vanilla to look at this and kind of spread this budget out further. Because. I want us to get at least to 2026 based on kind of the product roadmap, as you have had it laid out. Because I think, again, there's going to be increased costs as far as cloud infrastructure, which I did increase here. And then I don't know if there's any more staffing requirements that we've talked about.

### You (2025-09-23T22:07:17.043Z)

I apologize. I did not have a chance to pull that up yet, so I'll take a look at it. Quickly.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:07:24.802Z)

Ok? Ok, no worries. So you have to do that, if you can, this week. And then as far as. Marketing and sales costs. So last, like we talked about this last time that we. Are aiming really, that we would have beta customers on board in this kind of Q1 time frame and a paying customer starting in March. I guess at what point do we want to. I mean, I guess from a product perspective, at what point do we have a product that is stable and robust enough that we want that we would do, like, full marketing? Put any actual money towards media marketing.

### You (2025-09-23T22:08:11.043Z)

We. Yeah, go ahead.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:08:14.642Z)

Well, let's talk. Can I jump in here on that? So on media and marketing. Like the way I see really smart investor like. Like all those people use in the capital market space, right? Is they realize very heavily on short content, often video, sometimes written on LinkedIn and then they do a substacks. That's how I have seen, like, the content creation piece of it. Really resonate with other people in the industry. Like, they are actually creating content for people to consume around, like, investing and, like, interesting topics. That involve their product, Right? That promote their product. But that's how they're breaking through on the marketing and content creation part. So maybe I'm wrong, but I see it less on, like, actual advertising. And then maybe it's on conferences. Trade shows. And if I would put any money in there, I'd honestly put it for travel so that we could try to get in front of people face to face. Like a trip to D.C. you know, like. And Mark, you jump in here because this second part you're an expert on, but maybe you hit markets, a trip to New York or took to dc, a trip to Atlanta, trip to Dallas, a trip to la, and you try to hit as many people as you can in person. While you're there. Yeah. I mean, I don't really see. We should talk about how many users we expect to have in the first call it six months. But I view this as very much a kind of relationship based sale. Where, you know, we come up with a list of the top 20 lenders. And, you know, we figure out who has various relationships at East Institution. And we literally, you know, send emails, do zoom calls. You know, I think it's gonna be very much a personal marketing initiative. You know, I think maybe in year two, once we sort of get the ball rolling, maybe we start getting inbound inquiries. But I do think that it's gonna be relationship based marketing. At least initially. Yeah, that's sort of my thought as well. That I don't. I don't know. If. But I do think Howard brought a good point. And I'm sorry to interrupt, but go ahead. An investor who might be looking at this. And let's just move out of our friends and family space. Like, let's say I find three female friendly angel investors that would be interested in investing in this, right? Just because they're female focused. If they look at something like this, and this is with how zero marketing dollars, that may cause a red flag for them. So I think maybe what we could just do is collapse the marketing line. And I mean allocate something which then we end up, if we need is using it for travel to get out in front of these people and, you know, try to have face to face conversations. Yeah. Probably our best value for the dollar. Because there's just a massive people there. And if we could just kind of divide and conquer conferences. And just, you know, grab people, have a drink, have a cup of coffee and just sort of educate them into what we're doing. And then set up a follow up call.

### You (2025-09-23T22:11:37.363Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:11:37.762Z)

But yeah, we should have a marketing light item for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I mean, I started to put in some money for conferences. And I was as far as attendance. I mean, I can go to Alice. Mark, you can go to nyu. Diane, you can go to Hunter, any marker. Oh, yeah. So it's. I mean, I don't know. Again, this is just for the next 15 months. I don't know that. Some money here, but I don't think putting it really very much money towards marketing at this point. Because even if we. Get again, like, 25 different companies using the platform. It's gonna be 25 companies that we know and called and talk to and. No, but I think Diane's point is that just, even if we don't spend the money, just we should have a line item with marketing where we show people that we're reserving for it. We may not ultimately use it. But I think it's important to show people that we're thinking about marketing.

### You (2025-09-23T22:12:30.163Z)

Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:12:35.202Z)

I guess what we're saying. I'll also be subject to funding, right? We don't have any funding. Yeah, we're going to be really using our networks for more than. But if we had. Once we start to get funding, then it becomes easier because I don't know how you guys feel. I mean, Mark, you may be happy being a lobby lizard. Well, you can't even. Well, Drew, you can't at Alice. It's very, very hard to be a lobby lizard at Alice. It's easier at nyu. But you guys may not have that preference. You may want to actually buy. Get attendance so that you have more is more of like an alley lizard. Berry in the back where the Starbucks is. That's generally where I do most of my communications. Yeah. This form, this budget. I really just want us to use this to really, what do we think we're going to spend and need, because that'll feed back into how much we need to raise and generate in revenue. We can have a separate budget that is different that we would put kind of presenting to potential investors. This is really the core focus for this one. So if we genuinely don't think we're going to need a ton of money for the rest of 2,026. Well, you're going to be very berry in there, right. Next on Allocation for put in a couple of hundred bucks, this line here, right? So total marketing costs. There is some money in there for collateral, because I do think we need that. However. I don't think that I'd rather put the money elsewhere. I'd rather put it towards software, product development, staffing, that sort of thing. Yeah, I do think if we have a good website and we have some of these sort of demonstration tools where we have videos that actually walk a user through the technology. It's a good way to just be super efficient and really get the point across. Do we want to say? That's training instead of marketing.

### You (2025-09-23T22:14:31.443Z)

No, I agree with. Yeah, I agree with Mark. It would be well.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:14:35.682Z)

Or. No, that's marketing.

### You (2025-09-23T22:14:38.003Z)

I don't think it matters, honestly. Whether it could all be within that same group.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:14:43.362Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-23T22:14:44.163Z)

But along those lines, I do have money budgeted for a tool that does exactly what we're looking for. So in. In the product budget, There's. There's a subscription where tool called Scribe, where you just actually somebody like, like me would go and just click, like I would be doing a demo. While I'm doing that. It's taking the transcript and it will automatically, like, put in the effects, like, wherever my cursor is, right? And it's. That's exactly what it's designed to do. So it will also take the transcript and create a training manual. So we. That's how we can have some of our documents that we'll use on our reg system. Right? So the AI if somebody says, how do I do this? Oh, well, you know, here we've got this transcript that was created. Here's our manual. So that is something that I had to have every intention of starting on that. You know, as soon as we can. So that that'll cover what Mark wants. And you can use an AI Voice. It won't be me stumbling over my words. Right. It'll take the transcript, make it a nice, clean script. AI can go through and do it. It's not even. It. 's. Very inexpensive but very cool tool. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:16:12.322Z)

I do the same thing with Descript. It's a different form. Does the same thing. So, yeah, I think those. I have not actually used those for marketing at all. I use them all. I could see how it could be useful for sort of marketing purposes.

### You (2025-09-23T22:16:20.883Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:16:27.202Z)

Yeah, because a big part of our initial presentation is going to be getting people comfortable, removing them from Excel and showing them that our model is not intimidating. Right. And then if we could show them how the model can sort of self load itself, and I think those kinds of things would be very effective.

### You (2025-09-23T22:16:39.363Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:16:44.642Z)

Yeah. Ok. Well, I put in some just a line here for media content. Separate from actual distribution of that content and marketing, which I think, again, we can post up on LinkedIn. And that's sufficient for at least a near term. Or on a web page that we send to people that's on our website, etc. So I just put that in, but otherwise. Howard, take a look at these other expenses where I highlighted in yellow. And that's what we want to try to.

### You (2025-09-23T22:17:08.883Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:17:12.482Z)

Take out with, you know, whatever certainty you can for the rest of the year.

### You (2025-09-23T22:17:12.803Z)

Yeah. So you. You had actually started this off by asking when we would have a tool in the hands of users. So we are on track for having the lender model. By the end of the year. So, you know, we'll have the mvp done. You know, within a few weeks. And then between now and the end of the year is when we start the cycle of testing, taking the feedback from the testers, making whatever changes we need. Making sure we've got everything that we want. And then version one can go out, you know, end of December, beginning of January. So we definitely want to approach the people that we know, but theoretically. We could be marketing to. Anybody in the industry. And potentially get revenue coming in, you know, towards the end of Q1.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:18:22.482Z)

Ok? I mean, that would be. But maybe we don't include any revenue because this is just for us right now. I mean, so, like, let's. If this is our. Let's see how it goes and how the beta goes and then, like, gauge.

### You (2025-09-23T22:18:25.123Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:18:38.722Z)

If you know, I know at some point we're going to have paying customers, I 100%.

### You (2025-09-23T22:18:43.123Z)

We don't even have the pricing down yet, so we can't really put any revenue in.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:18:48.162Z)

Keep in mind that, I mean, even if we have a great call with a lender,

### You (2025-09-23T22:18:53.043Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:18:53.602Z)

And they love it. It's going to take them time to go through their internal process. To get approval to use us. So it's not just like, you know, they're going to say, yes, we love it, and sign us up tomorrow. Right? I mean, Drew, you know, I'm better than. What is the typical period? After you get signed off from individuals to get sort of corporate sign off on a new technology, how long does that take? Yeah, it can take a long time. But if we had. That's why it sounds. Howard. That's good to hear. Is if we have a product that. Is stable and usable by December. We can spend January really getting customers, you know, on board and hopefully some of them paying by April, because, again, at this point, you know, we'll have a monthly burn of at least 75,000. Per month. And so if we can get. 5, 10, 15, 20,000amonth. It's gonna. You know, that's. That's a significant offset and less we'll have to raise.

### You (2025-09-23T22:19:50.403Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:19:55.522Z)

And I don't. You know. I know we haven't figured out pricing yet, which is a complicated topic. I was and just. Just throwing this out there for revenue generation. I was almost just. Let's. Rather than trying to come up with pricing for this initial beta testers, let's just like, it could just be like, it's a flat amount. It's. It's 5,000, 10,000amonth, whatever. Because this is the beta, and there's no, you know, like, we don't have the logic worked out, but that's the pricing, and then. That makes it easier for us to completely change it down the road. Because it. Right. And if, if we are, I mean, I know this is, I'm perhaps being too optimistic, but if we could get Peachtree on as our beta tester, maybe there's a way they could become an investor as well for some amount. Right. And then once we get the beta better, then they become a paying client. But I don't want to say that's out of the realm of possibility, because for their debt and structured finance team, this could be a really great tool.

### You (2025-09-23T22:20:55.363Z)

It's interesting.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:20:58.562Z)

Yeah. Well, I mean, I wonder if it's. I wonder if it's one of the same. DIANE Right. If we went to Peachtree or to Greg Friedman or one of the guys and said, you know, for a hundred thousand dollar investment, you could actually use our technology for free for three months. Yeah. And give us feedback. Maybe it just becomes like a package deal. So it becomes less. You know, they look at it as an investment. But they also. We also get a beta tester as part of it. And we incorporate their feedback. Right? Like, it's like, okay, right. They say we need X, Y and Z. And so we build an X, Y and Z based on what their feedback is. Right? And maybe we just pre sell usage as part of the value of the investment. Yeah, if we can. If we can get that as revenue instead of investment, that would be even better. But I think. We'll have to really look at the product. In November, December and say, okay. To the point where we can go and ask Peachtree or somebody to pay X amount of money to use it. We got Peachtree to sign a safe note for. Again, just. We'll negotiate with ourselves for a minute. It's easier. Peachtree signed a safe note for $100,000. And, you know, part of the unwritten arrangement. Was that they just get the technology. For three months. That seems to me like the 100,000. Yeah, 100,000 up front in a safe note, versus 5,000 or 10,000amonth for investing in the future of the company. But they're getting the right to use it as part of their deal, if you will. Yeah. And then I think the other thing is, we could work with them and say, okay, you're the first lender we've ever done this with. And Drew, don't kill me when I say this, because I know that Actus hates the below market deals you've done, but maybe they could help. Us understand how to price something like this, too, if they're not contingent on it, right? Then maybe they could help us understand what's the real value. There's the value to the base model, but there's going to be value. And, Howard, don't kill me for this, but for the kind of, like, the AI advances that we start to put out, You know, throughout. I don't know, after the first six months, eight months, something like that. That helped build the modules up. Because I think we might need some honest to God feedback on what people would pay for this. Right. And they might be a good group to. Well, Mark, you know him better than I will. Maybe they'd give us really shitty advice. But. No, but the point is that if they're investing in the company, our interests are aligned. They want us to be successful. So that's the beauty of the structure, right? If they're coming in as an investor, right, they're going to be objective. Theory. So I have to jump in a few minutes. But I started to go through what Vinod put together and I think it looks good functionally. I see it coming together. It's definitely to the point where it needs. Mark, Diane needs us to really go in and start using it. And providing feedback. I mean, Howard, you as well. To the extent that this things, you know, don't align with the PoC or the document ation. Then call out and correct it. What was the source of the data? It was just an electric file that downloaded into this. I took this pnl which is from AGI for the astrocrown plaza and dropped it in. Created a deal, dropped it in uploaded 30 seconds later I was able to go to the deal the Pro forma page. View Proforma and the data is populated, right? So. It. Got it right. As far as the rows go, like occupancy. As occupancy. It just picked up data from 2023. From March, not from a full year. But otherwise a lot of this data. Right. Which is, again, I think, really good because that's. That's the big piece. Sounds like a good first step.

### You (2025-09-23T22:25:00.803Z)

I'm wondering if it's because the total column didn't have the year in it. On that. If you go back to your financial statement,

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:25:14.002Z)

Yeah. Could be. Could be. Again, there's all sorts of different types of files. There's full year, there's year to date. Right. Like in some cases, this would be the correct column. But, you know, this is the correct column, so it's complicated. I mean, for a computer, anyway.

### You (2025-09-23T22:25:30.483Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:25:35.202Z)

But I'm very excited that it got the rows mostly correct. We need to start providing feedback and testing it, so that's what I will do on this. And maybe after the first couple rounds of feedback and improvements from me, then Mark and Diane, you guys can go and do it, because presumably they'll be fewer. Errors, right? But, yeah, I think it's definitely exciting. I'm beginning to see the light at the end of the year as far as having a product that is functional and usable and sellable. All right. And let's think about this idea of the safe note and, you know, and part of the sales pitch at being able to use it for a quarter for free. And if we could come up with, you know, five or six safe notes based on that kind of arrangement. I mean, that could be an interesting way to raise money. Yeah, yeah. Maybe we go after the non bank lenders for something like this. Like the groups that are creating debt platforms. Do you know what I'm talking about? Less internal process than a Wells Fargo for sure. Right, Right, exactly.

### You (2025-09-23T22:26:49.043Z)

There's, there's, Yeah, I, I, I gathered a ton of notes on pricing, and I mean, basically everything that we've discussed is correct.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:26:52.242Z)

Yeah, so that could be an interesting way to do it.

### You (2025-09-23T22:27:01.363Z)

One of the things that stuck out to me and I just read this last couple days is because you cannot predict how much AI usage you're going to get. The, the article suggested in this particular case. And the whole, the whole article was about how do you price a brand new product? It was directly for startups. And since you don't have that information, they. They recommended just charge a fixed fee for the first year. And then for year two, you go back and you base the additional cost for the AI on top of that. So, you know, we talked about just having a flat fee. That's probably, you know, something that we need to consider. But there's another one also that brought up the exactly what we're talking about. Beta testers. And what do we do? There is a pretty strong argument for collecting something from the beta testers. Because then they kind of have skin in the game. In terms of they've paid for a product. Without that. They tend to log in once or twice, test it, and then. Go away. You don't really have. It's almost like you are. Making it. So. Look, look, you know, we. We just paid $10,000 for this. We got to get in there and test it on a regular basis versus we don't. You know, we didn't pay anything for it. Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:28:39.442Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-23T22:28:39.843Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:28:40.642Z)

And Howard, you're talking about beta investors that might not be a safe note investor, right? Like, because the safe not investor obviously has to get in the game, but just someone like a bank.

### You (2025-09-23T22:28:41.203Z)

Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:28:49.842Z)

Would not have skin in the game, and therefore they might not actually truly test it, right? Is that what you're saying?

### You (2025-09-23T22:28:51.043Z)

Yeah. And going back to. I apologize. I don't remember her name.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:28:56.322Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-23T22:28:58.403Z)

The vc. The vc. You know, the fact that, you know, even when we sign a client, you know, we want to put the full charge in the revenue. Then if we want to grant them credits or free period or. Or something, we're still going to show that top line is our ARR. So one thing you could do in this case, too, is say, okay. Sign a contract for a year. We would like you to beta test for 30 or 60 days. We'll credit you those 30 or 60 days off the. Off the bill. So innocence, they. They would be getting it for free. We then also can show. Oh, you know, we've got 10,000 ARR from ABC client, right?

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:29:53.442Z)

I got one of these. Whoops. And not sure why, but anyway, they have to be free for 30 days. And, you know, you just. You give them your credit card, and then if you don't cancel, then they automatically give you a year of subscription.

### You (2025-09-23T22:30:04.163Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:30:09.042Z)

So, you know, it's a very effective marketing pitch. I said, oh, I'll try it for free. It's for a month. Yeah. Did you say, though, that as far as, like, getting usage, like, because you don't know how, like, what level of usage you're gonna get, so you kind of don't know what your costs are?

### You (2025-09-23T22:30:23.443Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:30:26.642Z)

So say they didn't make sense. To charge nothing. For some period of time so that you know what those costs are or how did you I My phone I had to transfer to my.

### You (2025-09-23T22:30:33.683Z)

Well. We're going to be rolling out the AI in phases, right? So we're not going to have the features that are going to be real heavy token usage from an LLM. You know, just. Just taking the information that we have in the model and say, give me a summary, which is what we're going to be doing first. The cost on that is going to be pennies. So we'll have time to kind of build up. But yeah, we. I think I actually brought this up last week. I don't know if it was during the meeting or if it was during the one on one, but there are a lot of companies that. Are losing a lot of money. Every month. Because they had no way of knowing how much, how many tokens their users were going to use. And, and I think I mentioned that, you know, they, yeah, they charge, you know, 20 bucks a month, but they're paying $2,000 a month to the LLM because of all the data that's going back. And forth that they didn't account for. So, yeah, that, that's kind of what that article is talking about is get try to develop a baseline. And then in year two go back and say, okay, now we have to charge for usage. And. So so far, according to this article, they get almost no pushback from the clients. That, you know, they know from day one that they're getting year one. For probably a significant discount. And then in year two, They'll pay just for what they use. So.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:32:14.722Z)

All right. Well, yeah. This is exciting. This is a coming along. Sorry, I had jumped the car, so I'm driving now.

### You (2025-09-23T22:32:20.883Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I'll take a look at that.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:32:23.922Z)

Howard, you'll look over the. Budget. Diane, you'll work on the LLC operating agreement. I'm also going. To put together something additional to send to Carrie to piggyback on Marc's email. It's like that infographic that I was showing, so hopefully she can create that. We have the market, the pitch deck. That I was able actually was able to work on. Marc. I gotta go back and tweak more of the content, the wording, to make it what we all agreed on, which I will continue to do. But I think that's. That's getting pretty close. And then. Product testing. I'll work on that. I've already started to do it. I just need to write it up. If it would say a video would be sufficient exposed. Did he say that work as well as a write up?

### You (2025-09-23T22:33:12.323Z)

Yeah, well, actually, yeah, a video would be better. Because then the developers can see exactly what you are showing on the screen rather than trying to describe it in writing. It's a lot easier.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:33:29.282Z)

Yeah. Cool. And I will do that. Actually. Much easier than writing it up. And start to fix some of those gaps. The mapping and the alignment. And then a couple rounds that. And then Mark and Diane could start to do the same.

### You (2025-09-23T22:33:44.163Z)

Excellent. Okay? See ya.

### Guest (2025-09-23T22:33:48.482Z)

Sounds good. All right, Have a good night, everyone. Thanks. Bye.
