# Transcript for: Prep Convo

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:32:06.534Z)

Look at you. You have a button down shirt on.

### You (2025-12-05T15:32:09.600Z)

Oh.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:32:11.494Z)

How are you?

### You (2025-12-05T15:32:12.720Z)

I'm doing all right. How are you?

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:32:15.254Z)

I'm doing all right. And thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I just wanted to give you some background on John and how their partnership came together, and just. It might help you navigate the call. I'm just going to be in the background. In fact, I'm going to be on my cell. But if you need, like, a lifeline to any hotely stuff, then I'm there to jump in. Okay. So I got to get through some things to show you that are really important because I think they could change how you, like, think about this and how you present to him. But first. Drew did reach out to Mark. Mark called Drew back. I don't know what they talked about. I'm sure Drew said that we have this cease and desist in place and we can't do anything in that. He owns IP rights and probably tried to scare Mark at the same time. Drew would probably see a massive opportunity for hotel biz and trying to work with Mark to get the data processing. If this makes sense. So while he may be like talking to him about our inability to work with him because of the cease and desist, he might also be pitching that hotel biz would be a better solution.

### You (2025-12-05T15:33:10.000Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:33:34.694Z)

For Mark approaching CBRE and trying to find a partner to help process the data.

### You (2025-12-05T15:33:35.200Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:33:40.694Z)

Drew also has a partnership with Profit soared. And if I were Drew, I would be leveraging that. I would be telling Mark I have a relationship with Profit soared. They already process 8000p and LS. This would be such an easy thing for me to do for you, right? So. And you remember, I'm going to just start to share my screen, if that's all right.

### You (2025-12-05T15:34:04.880Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:34:06.054Z)

Okay, my screen. Can you see my calendar at this point? And I'm going to jump over to. Okay.

### You (2025-12-05T15:34:15.120Z)

Yeah, I can see. It.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:34:15.974Z)

Jump over. So again, this is profit soared, right? And there are essentially, this is Driftwood's like, this is just Driftwood's profit sword. But 8,000 hotels report into. Profit soared. They've been in existence 15 years. They're a big company. They're owned by Alpine investors. In a second, they could pick up that cbre the data processing. Right. So there is real risk that Mark would want to work with Drew over us.

### You (2025-12-05T15:34:40.000Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:34:47.414Z)

Now.

### You (2025-12-05T15:34:48.000Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:34:50.454Z)

What? What? This is called Profit sword. Most people know it as profits or the parent company change names to actable. But what they would never give Mark Woodworth and CBRE is they truly have zero understanding of anything beyond hotel operations. They have no idea how hotels trade. They know nothing about real estate. It's shocking how little they know about the real estate side of the business. They also. I'm just.

### You (2025-12-05T15:35:16.880Z)

Who are you referring to? Who's the. Bay.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:35:18.934Z)

This. This is profit soared.

### You (2025-12-05T15:35:20.960Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:35:21.734Z)

Who? I'm showing you their platform right now. Right. This is who Drew has a strategic relationship with. He just started it. And this is. He's working on an assignment. With a company called Rockbridge because they just announced that they're going to go into the owner business as well. But what I, I just, I don't even know how to sell against this if it, if it comes up. I think the main thing to think about is that they have a, like, this is a good sound bite, is that Profit Sword has a lot of technical debt they believe they owe to the management companies and so. They're really not that focused on the owner side of the business until they catch up with the technical debt. And what I mean by that is certain things aren't working. And their management company clients have like a request list a thousand miles long of things that they want. Right. Because they see it's working. But there's just more and more of that their management companies want. And so I don't think they would get the full attention that a CBRE or Mark Woodworth would want. And you've worked inside of Berkadia, right? So cbre. I'm sure Berkadia has. So. Right. You know what it's like. So that's our. That's the catch for us is we understand real estate. Right? We understand real estate, and we would be a much more like, focused. Aligned partner, right? Than Drew or Drew's partnership with profit sort, if that even comes up. It might not come up, but you are talking to. I think it's John. So let me show you who John is. On. John is. I need to move my. John is. So this is Mark Woodworth. Merged with John Ricker about a year and a half ago. John. This is John. This is an appraiser. And his partner, I believe, was Daniel Riley before the merger. They are. And I say this with the most utmost respect there because I love scrappy people. They are very scrappy appraisers that do a lot of select service work with regional banks. And I think they do a lot in the Southeast as well. They have great relationships with all these regional banks. They also pride themselves in that they have been doing call around when any deal trades or anything like that to try to get information on that deal and that trade. So the database that Mark is talking about is something they take a lot of pride in that they. That John and his partner built before they merged with Mark Woodward. And it's just got. I mean, think of it. An appraiser, right? An appraiser is going out trying to understand cap rate information. They're trying to get noi adr occupancy. And, you know, noi like all that information. So when Mark says we have a great robust data of our own, what he's talking about is the data that John and his partner have pulled together on all of these small appraisals that they've done. Okay. It might be why Jeremy talks a lot about small hotels as well. Just because, you know, that's a big focus for them. You will hit it off with John incredibly well. I think you guys are have similar demeanors and right perspectives and things like that. But now let me show you what I want to show you about what Driftwood is doing. Okay? So let me jump back as quick as I can. This is driftwoods. You can see it, right? It says mission Control.

### You (2025-12-05T15:39:27.200Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:39:28.694Z)

Okay, so this is their internal dashboarding and BI initiative. It's Sigma is. The platform that they're using for this. And you can see, you can do it at the portfolio or at the asset level. You can pull the star, you can pull the GOP weekly stats, financial summary. Right. Ownership. And I'll show you all of this. And this is a forecast accuracy report that I helped them build over the past couple of weeks in their system. But I was in the system trying to just get used to it. Like, how do I do work as an asset manager using this financial platform? Right. And I literally, I'm very focused on this hotel, the Hilton South Lake in the Dallas area, because they're going to put it on the market. And so there's going to be a lot of scrutiny on how the hotel is performing. And I couldn't. I was having trouble finding, just like the actual financial statement for November. And then I saw this. It says, ask AI. Right? This button right here, this is saying. So if you go here. It's pretty amazing. Their data. Scientist Kenny built this. Let me see if I can do this. Did the Hilton South Lake achieve. Budgeted. UD budgeted noi in. I'll just say October.

### You (2025-12-05T15:41:12.800Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:41:24.854Z)

I really did. I went. When I saw this, I'm like, oh, this isn't working. Because I'll show you another area where I think we can to driftwood. When we get to the point where we're, like, actually working with them. So they have actually. They're actually using AI to look. I mean, it's. It's crazy. Like, the actual noi was 7.65. The budgeted was 711. It was 7.6% above budget. The strong noi performance was driven by, right, this is pretty amazing. And then you come down here and it looks just to me, like perplexity. Like, it then prompts you for more questions, right? Like, to dive in deeper. And so I think that, like, this could be built for the industry. This is pretty amazing. And their database.

### You (2025-12-05T15:42:13.120Z)

This is very similar to what we already have. In our model. Where, you know, coming up with a deal summary. You know, what you're showing me here is simply.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:42:26.534Z)

AI.

### You (2025-12-05T15:42:26.800Z)

A chat. A chat box. That's connected to their database. So all it is is just going out, getting the information that they have on the database.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:42:35.574Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-05T15:42:41.600Z)

And possibly going outside. If there's anything in here that includes, like, market information. Or something else that maybe not is included in there. And that's exactly what we've. We've got on our roadmap.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:42:58.614Z)

And so that might be what John is interested in. Right? Because they have, again, they have om that they've saved. They have all this unstructured data. And so how do they start to unlock the value that they, they, they have from this 10 years of data collection? In this unstructured data. And so I think the key to winning John over is just right. It's like listening to his needs and then saying, oh, we see a solution. We've played around with this. I mean, you know, you can even say our, our anchor investor is doing this as well. So the technology exists, and it's. It's pretty amazing.

### You (2025-12-05T15:43:41.360Z)

So what? How do you spell actable? I don't know if I've even seen their website.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:43:45.894Z)

Ace. Act. Abl.

### You (2025-12-05T15:43:53.520Z)

Okay? Yeah. No. E. Maybe. Yeah. Okay? I'm not familiar. I'm not familiar with.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:44:01.094Z)

And people call them Profit Sword.

### You (2025-12-05T15:44:02.640Z)

It, you know? Okay.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:44:03.974Z)

Yeah. Yeah. People call them because that was their name before they.

### You (2025-12-05T15:44:07.520Z)

Oh, okay. All right. I want. I. Yeah, I want to take a look at this real quick to see what.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:44:10.534Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-05T15:44:18.080Z)

Their specific. Capabilities are. Because if. If drew. Is approaching Mark. And they only offer like Drew's. Power bi reporting. That. 's. That's so 2010.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:44:44.294Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-12-05T15:44:46.160Z)

I don't know if they offer any type of very similar like like the AI we already have it. We could pull up our product, do a demonstration show the push this button.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:44:52.614Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-05T15:44:57.680Z)

And provide a summary. We already have it.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:45:00.214Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-05T15:45:00.960Z)

I'm just doing a quick scroll down the page, and I don't see anything about that yet, but I will have to take a look at it.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:45:08.214Z)

Yeah. An actable the way they get the data. It's very structured. It's API integrations with the management companies, all sending the data into profits. Or just like Driftwood. Right. Driftwood's a client and you saw what the interface looked like. So the data is very, very good and well structured. Right. And Drew was working on an API integration with. Profit soared, which he really should have shared more of that with us. He kept it so close to the vest, it was a little unnerving, but. The other thing I just wanted to show you. And again, because I know this is where we're going as well, is this is another part of Driftwood's internal, like, bi. Right. So I just want to go really quick through this property overview room and demand analysis. This is what I'm showing you, right? Here would be like a next step for us in the. In this. In, like, this. What's called segmentation because it's a layer deeper for underwriting. But I don't want to spend too much time on that. Capitalization, right? So for every hotel that they own, you know, what was the purchase price, renovation, spend all of this. That structure. And this is what we're working on, right? Comp set. And then this is what I want to show you is work in progress. Valuation and leverage analysis. So I think we could take what we've created. On the valuation to Driftwood, like in January and say, let us test, you know, like, use our valuation model that we created and let's test it in your platform to see if we can just get the reps right, just get the reps down and start to have some success in some stats that we could share with people about how many test valuations we've done and things like that. Okay, so I did that. I talked to you about profit, Sward. I showed you. Let me just go back to Woodruff Core because the company composition is kind of important. So you've met Mark. Now Mark is the father. Maybe you call him the grandfather at this point. I don't know. In the hospitality industry of data, he developed. He owned pkf. It was a big appraisal, consulting data company. He sold it to CBRE in 2014, and he's been living with regret ever since because of what CBRE did to pkf. They just, like, imploded it.

### You (2025-12-05T15:47:17.840Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:47:48.614Z)

But you can see here that he has a lot of, like, people from his original team. So a, like, appraisers. Right? You can see Mais. Mai. So an appraiser that does asset management work. John is an appraiser. Tim Dick came from cbre. CBRE just let Tim Dick go. So he's an appraiser. He's also an asset manager. I don't know what this gentleman does. This gentleman does asset management work, but you can kind of get a compens like you can see the old school, right? Part of pkf. Jeremy's new blood. He came from Calibri. Heidi has been with Mark forever. He loves her. Dave Daniel is John's partner from the. It's Woodworth Core. So Mark Woodworth. And they owned a company called Core, so they merged it. And then you just have some people that are managing, like, their processes. Right. And then I'm going to come down here, Jack Cordial right here. He's the economist that I've mentioned. Right. That essentially Bill, Eva. And so I think that's the other thing is Mark, Mark really loves the idea of an AVM product. And again, their product that they built was more Zillow estimate, like, right? And that's what Jack built, and that's what Jack loves. And again, you're not going to talk to Jack today, but the day that we talked to Jack, you'll need to lead the discussion because he really dislikes. He just of that generation that he doesn't like women very much at all. And then they have some, again, some really great women supporting their business. Functions. So I just wanted to give you some of that background. And then the last thing. Let's see, two things. When you're. And you don't. I mean, the research on profit sort is for you to do or actables for you to do when you have time. Right. But I want to show you one other thing, and that is.

### You (2025-12-05T15:49:51.680Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:49:55.814Z)

Not to bring up today, but I'll walk you through this next week. When I left cbre, the actual proposal I had in front of cbre, which it was VAZ that I had in the vet in the unit, the appraisal unit, which sits very separate from the brokerage unit. And Mark said that the benchmarker product has now been transferred over to that to run going forward. So it's out of research. And now technically, in Vaz. Vaz has very good technology because they've been automating a personal internal and years and they have an amazing team of software engineers. It's doing it. But hotels always gets overlooked. But Vaz is going to be responsible for processing this data going forward. Right. And this is what Mark is trying to do is say, hey, why don't process this data for you? Because it's just such a nightmare for you guys to do in house. So when I left CBR4, the actual proposal was for us to go and invest between 2 and 4 million, which for CBRE is nothing, it's truly nothing. Right into this company. It was called my digital office at the time. It's since rebranded Otellier. Kind of like a pun on the hotelier. That, like, you know we're oteliate, right?

### You (2025-12-05T15:51:29.840Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:51:33.654Z)

They are a competitor to profit soared. And like Archer, They are almost leapfrogging profit sort. Because they're just newer. They're right. They're more focused on, I'd say, the right things. But now let me show you. I mean, it's a pretty substantial team. So my proposal to was go invest money in Otellier. I had significant conversations with Ali Malu, who is their executive chairman. And Ali was very interested in the idea of, like, moving into a capital markets or having, like, a capital markets module because his wife's family. Are their hotel investors. So he understands that business better than, say, sword. Who? Only our operators. And turn their budgeting module. Right. Use the core budgeting module, which is a lot like an underwriting module. Pors, pars, ADR occupancy. You know, it looks a lot like it to build out what we're trying to do at InnVestAI But I not doing anything on this. But I do want to put it out there. Like, this could still be open to us, right? It's like, years later, we're all in different positions. Like, Ali has done great things with my digital office, rebranded it. He's got an actual, like, chief security officer, right? I mean, they're like. They have infrastructure and. Wait, hold on. Where do I want to go? So, to show you where's the clients?

### You (2025-12-05T15:52:52.560Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:53:18.054Z)

Solutions. I'm on the team, right? So. It's good for you, like, if you have time to poke around this. But let me just go back to the main page. You can see they have relations with Highgate, Ambridge, Marriott, a core Mandarin, Hotel, equities, Stonebridge. And now I'm going back to the beginning, but. Here it is what I want to show you. MCR is a company that's a lot like driftwood. They're a lot like driftwood, and they are very technology focused at all as well. And they are kind of like a core partner to otai. Right. And so you can start to see how they become a, an evangelist. Right, right. For atelier. But they could be a second driftwood for us. And they're already tied into Otellier, so would never. I mean, obviously this is just. I'm throwing this idea out out there for you. It only has come to me because the whole benchmarker processing thing has resurfaced as an opportunity. But this would be another strategy we could use if we needed to. Like, figure out how to process data, because they're already processing 10,000 hotels, like profit sort, right? They're already ingesting. They have the API integrations. It's crazy. The overlap that's existing with the infrastructure that CBRE has, it's just a waste of their money.

### You (2025-12-05T15:54:30.400Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:55:11.654Z)

And. Yeah, go ahead.

### You (2025-12-05T15:55:12.880Z)

I need. I need to have. I need a few minutes before the. The meeting starts, so if we can go ahead and wrap this up, that'd be helpful.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:55:21.814Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-12-05T15:55:21.920Z)

So this. This is all very good information. I'm glad we were able to do this before the call. Scanning through the actable website. I. Am not concerned about. Mark going with them. Quite honestly, I. I can destroy them. Just knowing that Drew uses power bi. Which is basically Excel on steroids. It's. In my opinion, it is not yet something that's enterprise level, although they do advertise it as enterprise level. It's shaky. They do nothing with AI any. They. They do budgeting. For it, which is what they advertise, this forecasting. But it really is. All they're doing is they're collecting data. And aggregating and creating reports, which I can do what I can do in the afternoon. I mean, that's. Yeah. So I'm not worried about them. I think we. We've. We've already at where we are today.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:56:32.614Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-05T15:56:37.600Z)

We're already ahead of actable. You know, the fact that we've already got the AI integrated and everything. So I would still, you know, if they bring it up, You know, I would still like you to address it, because you're still way more knowledgeable about it than I am. But I would also be. Wanting to. Chime in and talk about the fact of all this information.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:56:59.894Z)

Yeah. Oh, no, you're. Yeah. I'm the fly on the wall if you need me. You say, diane, and I'll jump in because I'm not even going to be on camera. But I think this is, it's just like a good chance for you and John to start to build a relationship. Right. And so that's kind of, you know, and to just share ideas in what we're doing and get him excited about you and a potential partnership with you, so.

### You (2025-12-05T15:57:03.920Z)

So yeah. Y. Eah. Right. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah, okay. I'll see you in a couple minutes.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:57:28.854Z)

Okay. And I won't be on camera, so I'm just going to be in the background.

### You (2025-12-05T15:57:32.240Z)

Okay? All right. Thanks. Bye.

### Guest (2025-12-05T15:57:34.374Z)
