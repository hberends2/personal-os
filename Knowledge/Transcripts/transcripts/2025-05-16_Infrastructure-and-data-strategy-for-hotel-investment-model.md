creating a separate table for each year. Right? So you'll have year one, year two, year three. Because some of those, we do have different inputs for each year. Which I will need to go back

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:42:03.993Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T17:42:04.427Z)

on that mock up and Yeah. Show those

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:42:09.533Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:42:10.857Z)

You know, we'll have to have a different way of importing those But I'm rethinking. You know? Like I said, I don't wanna just take those 13 slides. I don't think anybody's gonna start on slide one and click and input 13 different things. Have to wanna go to each table. So I think what we should do are each page. So each category then, if you click on the category page, it should open up that screen, and then you'll have the associated input modals. There. Yeah. Do one thing. Yeah. Let's take a step back. Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:42:49.913Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Howard Howard, let's let's let's do one thing.

### You (2025-05-16T17:42:50.257Z)

Yeah. So one is we have the model.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:42:53.833Z)

Let's take a step back. Let's start from the beginning. Okay?

### You (2025-05-16T17:42:55.637Z)

For same model that you create this time, and then we look at

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:42:58.273Z)

So is we have the model for the model that you

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:01.267Z)

Yes. So that that

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:05.293Z)

created, Diane created, and then you took it forward with name changes. Alright.

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:05.957Z)

that that that And then

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:11.103Z)

So that that

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:12.157Z)

for for forecasting, say, five years down to my data. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:13.403Z)

consumes different, like, historical data. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:16.427Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:17.473Z)

We have some logic written for for forecasting, let's say, five years down the line data. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:20.247Z)

So Well, the that was and this Well, Remember, the forecasting is gonna be based on the user inputs.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:26.633Z)

And so

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:29.177Z)

So you'll have the historical, then the user will have to input their

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:29.463Z)

that is and this uh-huh. Sure.

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:33.007Z)

assumptions to calculate it. Right? So I just wanted to make sure that we're we're not looking for an algorithm or anything to ex expand forward. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:43:49.643Z)

Yes. And do you do you have that model handy right now? I mean, it's in the team. We can we can open it. Let's let's see. How much time you have?

### You (2025-05-16T17:43:57.827Z)

Maybe a half hour. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we're gonna go from one to two but I I I can't go much beyond two fifteen. But yeah. Let me I do actually have the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:09.403Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:10.947Z)

Excel open here. I have one that's been on the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:13.503Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:15.347Z)

I take so that yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:22.053Z)

Also wanted to touch base on that, ownership thing.

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:22.167Z)

Yeah. Well, that's gonna be kind of a

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:25.613Z)

I think they are not saying she want to restore. I see.

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:25.787Z)

I mean, it's gonna be a group decision. We gotta get with Diane.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:29.323Z)

We have figured that out. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:31.267Z)

Yeah. We Yeah. Definitely wanna bring it up on on Monday's call.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:44:40.013Z)

Yeah. We'll record the tweets, please.

### You (2025-05-16T17:44:40.107Z)

So come on. Why is this not showing? Okay. Are you seeing that now? Oops. I think it's trying to come up later. Yeah. How about now? Do you see the Excel?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:01.353Z)

Something is trying to come up with

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:02.107Z)

Yeah. See. Okay. Okay. And is it large enough?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:04.233Z)

not yet.

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:05.797Z)

Do I need to make it larger? Okay. Alright. So here is what I have done. Of course, we've talked about this before. Here's all the named ranges.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:15.963Z)

Yeah. I see. See that. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:20.047Z)

And then Drew went through and kinda put them in a particular order here of

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:23.763Z)

Yeah. If we mail, that'll be great.

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:25.447Z)

how he thought we would walk through the model or that the user would walk through the model. So these correlate to buzz models that I sent to you. Right? Yeah. So that just on this one. Okay? Yeah. So then what I had to do is what I what I did not do before is associate a column name

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:51.433Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:53.267Z)

or the table to those modals.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:55.993Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:56.127Z)

So that's what I did yesterday. So I

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:56.753Z)

Right. Right. So just on this one. Okay?

### You (2025-05-16T17:45:59.467Z)

basically uploaded this and just

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:45:59.533Z)

So Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T17:46:02.997Z)

asked to create a database schema that took you know, for the property details model, these are the inputs. Right? So there's, you know, 10 inputs on that modal. So this will be the the name of the column, you know, this be the format. And then I did the same thing for the next one, which is the acquisition model.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:46:22.693Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T17:46:25.777Z)

And so on and so on. So so these should be the column name. Now I did not put the ID in here, but when we created this when I created the SQL, asked it to make sure that number one every single one of these tables will have to be tied to the property details. Right? So every property, every deal is gonna have this information input. So that you ID, the property ID, was added to each of the tables. And, of course, each of the tables has its own ID. It's etcetera. So we should have a working database for all of those models. So now what I need to do and what I've been on is I'm gonna start going through these pages based on know, what we have worked on before, know? So I now need to go through and say, okay. How where where are these? So, for example, the operating cash flow, I've already gone through on a separate worksheet. I don't have that one open right now, but I've identified all of these items here. That will correlate to the key or to the to the inputs that we put in. Then down here, I'm starting to create the formulas. So how do we how do we calculate the room revenue based on those fields. Right? And that's what I'm trying to do. So whether we precalculate it or not, we have to know, you know, what table is this located in or what what what field is it. So that's where I've been going. So I'm gonna ask you, am I going in the right direction? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I'm looking forward to a report there. If we could please go back to the main bridge. Yeah. Let's go to open that one. There. Then right there. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:48:37.523Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, before we we go there,

### You (2025-05-16T17:48:43.397Z)

probably.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:48:43.873Z)

if you could please go back to the named range

### You (2025-05-16T17:48:44.227Z)

Before. Before this time. The one you are showing in the tablet format when there was not

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:48:47.893Z)

one. And let's go back to that one. The name range tab. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:48:53.577Z)

I'll see again. It's just called BAM tables.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:48:57.143Z)

So no. I'll let you are showing in the tablet format.

### You (2025-05-16T17:48:58.697Z)

Oh, Cool. This one you created, Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:03.283Z)

Probably before

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:03.667Z)

I'm not gonna when we are looking out. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So this one, right,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:04.963Z)

before this tab. The one you are showing in the tablet format, maybe that are non

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:08.637Z)

So this one property

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:09.833Z)

named range.

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:10.437Z)

sensor ID, all this.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:10.853Z)

Get click on that one.

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:12.037Z)

Status.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:12.743Z)

Yeah. I don't see the name of the tab because there's something on yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:18.197Z)

We

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:18.433Z)

Okay. Cool.

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:18.717Z)

getting either.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:20.143Z)

This one you created? In

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:22.447Z)

Yes. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:23.713Z)

and now, like, when you are working now. Okay. So this one, right,

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:27.747Z)

Imagine.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:28.113Z)

So this one, property names and society, all this status,

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:31.607Z)

And the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:35.593Z)

So this one, we are getting when either

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:36.697Z)

Yeah. Let me switch screens here.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:40.223Z)

yeah. While we are creating the deal. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:40.507Z)

Just to make sure that we're on the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:43.563Z)

Yeah. I'm the I'm trying to

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:45.557Z)

same page here, let me open up another

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:49:46.513Z)

the imagine the format how they'll fit into the entire deal creation, and then how will we edit the existing model? Right?

### You (2025-05-16T17:49:58.087Z)

now I gotta change the screen that I'm sharing.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:50:05.513Z)

I can ping you. Yep.

### You (2025-05-16T17:50:18.757Z)

Alright. So Alright. So I can't show both at the same time with this setup, but yes. On that tables tab, for the property details, each of those field names corresponds to these input boxes. Right? Here's the property name that is the same as the property name column. And then census ID column. And address, city, etcetera. Right? So every time we change these modals, right, and then here's the acquisition model, and here's the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:51:07.943Z)

That's okay. We can move on with

### You (2025-05-16T17:51:09.007Z)

seven fields that I showed you on the Excel spreadsheet. For, you know you know, they've got their different names. This one's just like ACK. ACK costs, ACK month, or whatever. So, yes, those

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:51:20.843Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-16T17:51:21.487Z)

those that I'm showing on that page, and it's it's it's uploaded to the version that's saved to the team site, so you've got access to it. In fact, you could even open it right now if you wanted to jump in there. But that's really what I'm doing here is is creating database schema for the user inputs. So something that I in Howard. So How So Mhmm. Stop over there. Should I take care? Yeah. Yeah. So this is I I I put together that work flow, and this is what what we

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:13.833Z)

It how power?

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:15.727Z)

are thinking about. This what we talked about is

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:15.853Z)

Would I have that question and I'm kind of not able to

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:18.937Z)

can input a property name.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:19.623Z)

link them together again once once again. Okay?

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:20.557Z)

Right. And we'll have the smart search.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:21.883Z)

So this deal creation flow, right,

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:23.277Z)

Or I might already know the census ID, and I can just type in the census ID

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:24.683Z)

suppose I'm getting the data from

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:28.377Z)

And if we have a match here

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:29.413Z)

Draws database. What all

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:30.587Z)

with Drew's data,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:32.803Z)

feel

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:32.837Z)

you know, we can have a model that pops up and says,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:33.813Z)

should I expect that, you know, they should be there?

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:35.677Z)

you know, we have found a match. Would you like us to fill it in or something like that?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:37.073Z)

And user doesn't have to

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:39.417Z)

They click the button, and then then, yeah, absolutely. We would want to go ahead and fill in

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:39.473Z)

you know, type them manually.

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:43.957Z)

all of this information. And then, you know, even going through all these different well,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:49.153Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:49.277Z)

actually, a lot of this stuff, he's gonna have historical data. So I don't think any of these financing, any of this

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:52:53.203Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:52:56.847Z)

any of these following screens gonna have the data from Drew.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:53:00.203Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:53:01.377Z)

I really think the only thing we're gonna get from him for this portion is the property details. However, if I go if you go back to the Excel model, there is other information in the model. That we would pre populate. So that's another thing, you know, I haven't gotten to yet. I haven't gotten to any of the tables or the pages. Where that information would be used. So that's really kinda what I'm working on right now is the historical information from Drew, and the calculations. Right? So I'm gonna go page by page through the Excel spreadsheet

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:53:38.883Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T17:53:41.837Z)

and then put together the the calculations. Then then you and I need to decide, this something we wanna to pre calculate in the database or do we want to just have this page layout? And that's another thing I need to do is know, those Excel spreadsheets have a lot of information. It's like how much do we wanna show on the screen? What can be calculated in the back background? Do we really have to show every single one of these rows and columns?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:54:06.933Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:54:08.687Z)

So that's why I'm kinda really concerned about the four week thing right now because now we're really getting into the minutiae. Of putting this So I would Yeah. So you are saying It's it's it's geographic.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:54:46.963Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:54:49.067Z)

You know? Right.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:54:49.173Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:54:51.917Z)

Other ones. Right? I don't want you to do the same quality. So is it possible that we

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:54:52.483Z)

So one moment, Howard. So you are saying when the user is creating the deal, only information that we are getting from through is just this page. Which we don't even need from Drew. This information we can get from anywhere, probably from event

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:05.217Z)

such as the this information?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:08.053Z)

or

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:09.087Z)

The

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:10.183Z)

you know, if we kind of do the

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:11.367Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:15.183Z)

and

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:15.527Z)

That's that's what the user does. Just just like in RedeyeQ,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:16.413Z)

know I mean, this information is pretty basic.

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:19.777Z)

they upload an operating statement or a rent roll,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:21.323Z)

Uh-huh. Right. But what I'm concerned about is the

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:23.147Z)

they're uploading the operating statement, but then they go into valuation

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:25.513Z)

ones. Right? I don't want the user to feel all that.

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:27.937Z)

IQ, And in valuation IQ, they have these types of field. Right? So there's

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:28.913Z)

Is it possible that we get that data from somewhere?

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:32.727Z)

there's a whole

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:32.903Z)

Like, not from this Drew doesn't have it. Is there any other source that

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:34.107Z)

worksheet for financing. And there's another worksheet for disposition assumptions.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:37.573Z)

provide us that data?

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:41.207Z)

What we're doing here on this screen is essentially

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:43.783Z)

Yes. Say, capital expense or

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:45.997Z)

what the our users were either doing in valuation IQ

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:47.223Z)

assumption. Adjunction user has to do that. Right? That's

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:50.007Z)

or in their own

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:51.723Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:51.847Z)

spreadsheet. By using Quikr.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:55:55.633Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-16T17:55:56.037Z)

Yeah. So No. No. Because this is this is me as an investor putting in my assumptions. Right? There's nobody if I plan on buying a property, I don't care whether it's multifamily, hotel, or whatever, I've got multiple options. I can just basically leave it as it is. And just

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:56:27.253Z)

I know.

### You (2025-05-16T17:56:27.447Z)

continue operating it. I might want to

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:56:30.803Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T17:56:30.867Z)

renovate it

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:56:32.303Z)

So what if they they upload their documents? Won't

### You (2025-05-16T17:56:32.637Z)

You know, I might rip out all the carpet and all the different things, put in new. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:56:36.993Z)

those documents have the this information?

### You (2025-05-16T17:56:37.737Z)

And that's what I need to forecast. So am I gonna am I gonna replace all the carpeting in year one Am I going to do this? Same thing with the cap rates.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:56:44.253Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:56:49.107Z)

And the financing. Right? The financing is based on me. What would I qualify for? What kind of financing can I get? So there's no data anywhere that can give us that information. And so all of these do have to be input by the user just like they are in the Excel spreadsheet. We we can't do the least for the near term now, what we can do especially for things like financing, There there is data out there, right, that says, okay. Well, here's the average interest rate on this type of loan. Right? So we can pull that data in And that's something we could probably do fairly quickly. But for the proof of concept and everything else, gonna have to Yeah. That's a good question. If

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:57:46.813Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T17:57:49.747Z)

some of that, you know.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:57:51.723Z)

It

### You (2025-05-16T17:57:54.307Z)

Yeah. Interesting. So investment assumptions Mark has mentioned a couple times that for the capital expense

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:10.333Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:12.307Z)

sometimes there is like a

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:13.443Z)

Right. So can we default it to some values, like, default values?

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:15.097Z)

fee of, like, 2% that most lenders stick by. So maybe that's something we can do.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:21.653Z)

I mean, user can modify it, but

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:23.657Z)

We can do

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:25.203Z)

if not, we probably put some lump sum value

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:26.647Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Now penetration analysis, this

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:29.123Z)

might be closed.

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:30.567Z)

this is based on the competition. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:30.963Z)

Might pick just from that.

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:34.057Z)

we could potentially pre populate quite a bit of this from from Drew's database or some of the other databases that we've been talking about, because this is just you know, like our users pulling in comp data,

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:58:46.673Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T17:58:50.837Z)

If we know the name of the comp, where where the property, where it's located, the the type of property, so we're making sure it's apples to apples. We could potentially prepopulate this one, the penetration.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:59:03.533Z)

We can discuss this in tomorrow's call as well.

### You (2025-05-16T17:59:07.077Z)

The other ones

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:59:08.223Z)

Okay. Cool. Super. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:59:10.847Z)

I I don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:59:11.793Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T17:59:12.417Z)

We would probably that that's a good question to bring up on the call Monday. Because I know where you're going, and I I agree. Whatever we can repopulate out of the gate for the users, that's gonna be a win. So Yeah. It it take It is. It is. And and and number one, we're we're not going to get a

### Guest (2025-05-16T17:59:44.813Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-05-16T17:59:45.837Z)

around that. Totally, but we can when we start bringing in data from other sources and when we get enough users using our product so that we know what is the average rate. What's the average expense? What's the average income? Then we can start pre populating it

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:05.993Z)

If the user is still inputting all these values, what's the point of

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:06.987Z)

You know? And then they can start going through and and making tweaks

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:10.973Z)

our drama? We are doing other things like it.

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:12.437Z)

Right? So so yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:13.863Z)

Giving them reports and all that.

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:15.887Z)

Is that is absolutely where we wanna go. But

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:17.633Z)

But still, this is lot for a user to fill.

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:18.207Z)

but at the beginning. Right. Gonna have to have this process. Right. So I just wanna clarify that. Right. So Yeah. Yeah. In fact, one of the things we might wanna talk about is, for example, they they could be buying you know, a basic hotel that

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:48.053Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:49.707Z)

maybe all they have is vending. They don't have any food and beverage or banquet

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:52.323Z)

Yeah. Yep. Cool. So

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:55.297Z)

or whatever. So a lot of these departmental things

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:00:57.903Z)

right. Right.

### You (2025-05-16T18:00:58.737Z)

don't even have to show up. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:01.193Z)

Yeah. Right. So as

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:03.527Z)

do we want to overwhelm them with having all these

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:05.303Z)

far as our current Excel model model goes,

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:06.967Z)

tabs on there? No. I would say that you know, the very first thing is when they're filling in

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:09.503Z)

if the user does not fill all this information,

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:11.947Z)

the property details,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:12.323Z)

we can still generate user or model

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:13.637Z)

And they come down to the property type,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:15.823Z)

but it will have selected

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:16.697Z)

if it's just

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:18.023Z)

tabs at the end. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:18.057Z)

I don't I don't remember the name of the just basic budget hotel or whatever it is, and it doesn't have any of those, then that would be dynamically controlling what we show here. They would have far fewer fields that they need to fill in. And

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:01:36.483Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:01:47.857Z)

that I it's in between? Well, that's the kind of feedback we need. And and, you know, with with Red IQ, this is the same thing as the deal

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:04.573Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:07.197Z)

page. You know, every multifamily deal a Red IQ user added to their deal list, they have to go through here and do this.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:15.423Z)

Right. And do we need the user to fill this

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:16.617Z)

But, you know, that's another thing that we wanna talk about on Monday as well is, you know, number one, if Drew has this data, we can pre

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:22.003Z)

upfront? Like, the user is creating a deal,

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:25.327Z)

populate it with as much as

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:25.773Z)

or

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:27.067Z)

possible.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:28.523Z)

because that way,

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:29.077Z)

But they did mention other sources that

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:30.453Z)

I'm sure that she receives a rule come to decide

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:32.227Z)

have just the this type of information.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:02:34.613Z)

what if you would have just feel frustrated and leaves in between because there's too much

### You (2025-05-16T18:02:36.437Z)

So, you know, if we have to subscribe to another service and get this information so that, you know, when they start typing in, you know, the Holiday Inn and you could go through and prepopulate a lot of this. Right? So even, you know, property type, the number of rooms, all that information could be prepopulated. Okay. Right. Yeah. And the we get to work out. We So something. On that. Probably Yeah. Yeah. You know? And and and that's a good point too. I haven't gone through line by line to see what

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:03:37.913Z)

Alright. Right.

### You (2025-05-16T18:03:39.247Z)

he's got, but, you know, there is a very good possibility that you know, some of these infer I mean, obviously, the acquisition

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:03:42.753Z)

Or we just let the user create the deal first.

### You (2025-05-16T18:03:45.977Z)

month and this information, will have to be put in by

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:03:48.763Z)

And then we pull the data from Drew,

### You (2025-05-16T18:03:50.107Z)

the this the buyer, you know, We don't know when they're gonna actually sign the documents.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:03:52.723Z)

right, on that deal.

### You (2025-05-16T18:03:55.337Z)

But some of this cap rate information or, you know, that there yeah. There are

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:03:57.573Z)

Then we will get what also. We have the

### You (2025-05-16T18:03:59.677Z)

things on here that we might be able to kinda do what I was talking about before, you know, take the

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:02.923Z)

all the historical data. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:04:04.437Z)

average

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:05.853Z)

So based on that,

### You (2025-05-16T18:04:05.907Z)

we have that data for you know, hotels that are in the same location and the same type of hotel,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:08.453Z)

probably model will be missing

### You (2025-05-16T18:04:12.667Z)

we probably could.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:13.023Z)

many tabs.

### You (2025-05-16T18:04:15.527Z)

So Well, I This would be on property. This active Yeah. Yeah. So so this kind of ties into then once we get this information. Right? So this will be kind of the deal details, you know, or or investment details, whatever we wanna call it, you investment assumption. Then going back to that PowerPoint slide right here. So, you know, up at the top of the screen here, we would have those KPI cards or whatever have, you know, in year one, then, etcetera.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:56.433Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:04:58.567Z)

Then and then down below,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:04:59.413Z)

Well and then as far as editing these details go,

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:00.797Z)

you know, like, the last two thirds of this of this screen down here is where we would have some of those

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:05:03.833Z)

this will be edited on property detail page. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:07.757Z)

the data already from the financial. We could have the historical information

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:05:08.133Z)

So this will have each section, and then user can add it in there. Right? Okay. Cool.

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:12.397Z)

displayed here. So here's my 2021, '22, 23, and 24 columns, and then I have to you know, forecast from '25 forward. You know? And then they could go through here. And then but we would wanna do that by page by page. So right now, these aren't live links, but we would want them to say, okay. I'm gonna click on my investments

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:05:34.643Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:35.077Z)

assumptions. They'll already have this information here.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:05:38.053Z)

Bye.

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:39.617Z)

You know, they could go and make changes to it here, but, you know, we would have

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:05:40.133Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:05:44.147Z)

some KPI cards up here that are specific to investment assumptions and not necessarily some of these other ones. But like, market said, there are some things that we're gonna wanna show on every page so that if I go in here and I change a cell, and it'll go through the run the calculations in real time, and then I can see the change to my investment returns and you know, that's that's really what we're gonna save time. I mean, the initial setup yeah, it's gonna take a few minutes. At at the very beginning. You know, as we progress, we'll automate it. And then they just have to tweak But what where the real value is is not having to switch back and forth between pages or having to go to totally different spreadsheets or web

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:06:31.503Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-16T18:06:33.757Z)

to get this information,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:06:35.633Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:06:35.647Z)

And if I can go in here and change a cell and I say, okay. If I change this,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:06:36.543Z)

Here.

### You (2025-05-16T18:06:40.617Z)

particular input, my rate of return is what my investors are going through, and and, you know, we would have a price displayed out there. So okay. So this is valued at whatever. You know, what takes weeks just like with Red IQ, same thing. What what could take weeks, we can narrow down to days. And hours. Yep. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:13.903Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:17.507Z)

Did that. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:20.603Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:25.047Z)

For the guy go. I'm what my goal is to get the users out of Excel. So if you have to do both this and their own Excel model,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:43.923Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:47.067Z)

there's there's no reason. So I would want

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:48.623Z)

That makes sense. And then as far as the model added

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:49.447Z)

all edits to take place within the app here.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:53.353Z)

will, right, we

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:53.637Z)

Now

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:54.953Z)

we need that

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:55.127Z)

we haven't talked about this yet, but we probably will

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:07:56.923Z)

too. Right? So the actual model

### You (2025-05-16T18:07:58.627Z)

have something just like we do in in Rede where you can export to Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:01.583Z)

is there. Right? So if the user has to add it

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:04.027Z)

We don't have to export it. It it could be a simple CSV

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:05.683Z)

the details, directly,

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:08.697Z)

file.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:09.043Z)

for the model

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:09.147Z)

That has just the columns and the rows with the data. We

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:11.333Z)

So where does that

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:12.557Z)

don't have to have calculated fields or formulas.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:14.243Z)

go?

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:16.177Z)

We don't want them to do calculations in Excel, but if they really wanted to get data out of here that they can copy and then maybe paste into a different model,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:23.473Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:27.307Z)

that that's how we would probably wanna accommodate it. One of the things I have very interesting is when I was doing a really competitive analysis with Red IQ, we were the only ones that exported Excel with formulas. None of the competitors did that. It was a simple data dump in a CSV. So I mean, it was nice. It was a

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:47.143Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:08:49.667Z)

a potential selling point for us, but I never had one person tell us that that's important. To them. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:08:58.803Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:09:13.327Z)

I just Yeah. Yeah. So let me go back.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:09:43.033Z)

Right. Where I was coming from is suppose we

### You (2025-05-16T18:09:44.247Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're gonna have to

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:09:46.983Z)

data from Drew.

### You (2025-05-16T18:09:48.197Z)

we're we're gonna have to account for that as

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:09:50.453Z)

And then user kind of goes through it. Right? And

### You (2025-05-16T18:09:52.597Z)

well because Drew only has a small portion of the entire industry. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:09:56.383Z)

One second. I'm just trying to see that model. So we have that model. So

### You (2025-05-16T18:09:59.277Z)

unless we you know, hopefully, you know, we can sell to Drew's customers. Right? And get our feet

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:02.853Z)

we we input data. So how do we

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:06.317Z)

going there. And he's got some big clients, so that's not a terrible thing.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:06.683Z)

show that entire model on the application?

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:10.477Z)

So if we are working

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:11.373Z)

Layer. So it's in the tablet format in the application. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:12.847Z)

with Drew's clients, shouldn't be a problem. But when we start getting clients that aren't Drew's, that he doesn't have the data,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:19.123Z)

And then user can

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:21.147Z)

that's when we're gonna have to

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:23.353Z)

I suppose we got the data from

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:23.687Z)

import their data. And that's where I think we really wanna partner with Drew If he's already got the

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:10:26.223Z)

Drew, but do you think that is not correct? To modify. They can do it.

### You (2025-05-16T18:10:31.237Z)

capability of importing the data, from users. Then what we could do is we could sign on the clients. And even if even if we use Drew's product in the background, I know need to go through and build an Excel data extractor or whatever if he's already got it. So but with that is a discussion we have to have. I know Diane's still talk to him. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think we we've talked about that

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:11:07.883Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:11:09.197Z)

don't think that's gonna be a problem. Because he is giving us the data. Already. Right? So we are we've talked about all of this information coming in. Okay. Okay. Said it. For the five. Yeah. AM. To the data and give us the data we stored and use it. Yeah. Yeah. And so so that that's what I'm thinking. If if if we sell to a client who is not using his services, we would still say, okay, you know, we could we could still provide the mechanism for them to upload a file

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:11:43.203Z)

No.

### You (2025-05-16T18:11:44.697Z)

instead of us processing it, we could send it through Drew's process

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:11:44.913Z)

But the problem the problem is we are sending our data to some other company. We

### You (2025-05-16T18:11:48.627Z)

and then get the information sent back to us via the API.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:11:50.543Z)

we need to store that data in our debt.

### You (2025-05-16T18:11:52.307Z)

I mean, the client doesn't have to know who was actually extracting the data. We just have to get that data back. Yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:02.313Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:03.857Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Case.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:10.563Z)

So we send the Excel or whatever whatever file to him. He extract the

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:10.717Z)

No. That's that's true. I have you seen the demo of it? Have you actually because I haven't. I I have no idea.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:14.603Z)

and give us the data. We store it and use it.

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:18.337Z)

Yeah. You know, I mean, if he's if he's if he's just copying and pasting, well, then we'd have to rethink this. No. That's that's Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:33.163Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:42.507Z)

That's why I'm wondering if he's got a similar system to what we had where the users

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:45.883Z)

Yeah. Only the thing is, we'll have to see how

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:47.327Z)

just upload their spreadsheets or something, and then he hasn't

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:50.493Z)

efficient rule system is

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:52.307Z)

extraction process, and then maps it to

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:53.173Z)

and how it is performance wise because it might be taking

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:56.597Z)

the the accounts or or whether

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:12:57.333Z)

entire day to perform the Excel.

### You (2025-05-16T18:12:59.617Z)

he's literally copying and pasting. I know. That's a good point.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:04.373Z)

That he just provide.

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:04.907Z)

So maybe that next week is just like Mark had it

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:07.213Z)

Yeah. Only provided us Excel.

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:09.547Z)

had a walk through. Maybe we have to have Drew go through. But

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:13.143Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:14.347Z)

we we can ask on Monday's call.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:15.513Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:17.897Z)

If if

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:18.293Z)

Yeah. And if it's

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:19.087Z)

is still not sure

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:20.593Z)

yeah. The other thing yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:21.117Z)

what his role is going to be or how

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:22.833Z)

Yeah. I mean, as far as I know, he doesn't have

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:24.437Z)

we're gonna format this, he still might be weary of giving

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:26.213Z)

APIs. I I don't know how he's

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:27.937Z)

a real detailed demo because

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:13:28.253Z)

doing all this. Was saying he doesn't have APIs. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:13:30.587Z)

you know, we can probably copy it. Whatever he's got, or do our own. Don't think we I I doubt that he would I doubt that he would not be willing to do that. I'd be really surprised. So So if you're do give us all the So I had been yeah. I I've been avoiding those conversations because I know he's talking to Diane. And and I don't wanna get in there and and know, cause an issue. I haven't been able

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:07.103Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:07.177Z)

inadvertently. Yeah. We can help with that. Right? Yeah. Yeah. She Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:19.623Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:20.897Z)

Yeah. And then to predict sorted. Yeah. Yeah. And we we do need an answer right away. I mean, we can't keep

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:32.773Z)

So is he, like, ready to give us all the financial

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:32.787Z)

dragging this on, especially if we're gonna get to this point So she did respond to my email about the entity

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:36.573Z)

data, all the market data he has? Yeah. Because we'll

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:40.527Z)

Yeah. Well, because one of the things also is that

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:42.713Z)

we'll need that data.

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:44.287Z)

we can't really have

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:45.063Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:47.147Z)

everybody have the same amount of equity unless we have an odd number of people. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:53.953Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:54.917Z)

if you if you're gonna have a corporation,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:55.263Z)

I mean, we can yeah, we can talk to Diane Diane avoid it. Right?

### You (2025-05-16T18:14:57.017Z)

everything is done by a vote.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:14:59.403Z)

Yes. Like, if he can give us

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:00.407Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So if we're all officers of the corporation, you have

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:03.443Z)

let's see. We'll need the data because

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:05.337Z)

vote. If we the way we've got it set up, if it's just the four of us, you could have a two a two two tie.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:05.633Z)

if we are supposed to train the the our model, and then do prediction.

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:11.237Z)

But if he comes in as an officer,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:12.253Z)

Cannot do it without data. Data is what we need for that.

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:14.017Z)

then we wouldn't have to worry about that. And so she was asking about what how we would structure that. And

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:21.933Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:23.307Z)

so I know that she's talking to him and trying to figure out

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:26.813Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:28.427Z)

how we can get this to work. So I think she really wants him to be on board as a partner and not necessarily a vendor, but

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:15:36.033Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:15:37.317Z)

I don't know. So Yeah. That's what we need. That's we We have money for We we all paid for our own email address. So, yeah, I don't think we're gonna be forking out $10,000 for the database table. But but yeah. Yeah. Although it was interesting that they that Mark said in that call the other day that there are some large companies that do up daily daily information into STR. I don't know why. It'd be interesting to find out But, yeah, I mean, it seems like everything

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:16:28.213Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what we need

### You (2025-05-16T18:16:30.417Z)

monthly based on whenever they upload their financial statements.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:16:32.963Z)

right now as well. Right? We don't have money to buy his data.

### You (2025-05-16T18:16:35.177Z)

So you know, unless they're looking just like just like apartment communities do it, you know, how many people are coming through the door, how many you know, are they looking at trends like weekend versus midweek?

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:16:47.343Z)

Yeah. It might be more.

### You (2025-05-16T18:16:50.367Z)

I I don't know why they would do it daily, but

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:16:51.553Z)

He has to provide data on monthly basis because these

### You (2025-05-16T18:16:53.307Z)

we can find out.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:16:55.143Z)

records seen and we need monthly data.

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:03.807Z)

Point. I think we

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:04.503Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:04.767Z)

both SPS. True. Even Right. And then I kinda got the impression when we first started talking to her that that that was what he was going to do is that he's got connections, and he's got

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:43.183Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:44.357Z)

people who would be interested. So I always kinda thought he was gonna be the money man.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:47.613Z)

So that and what was the other thing I was thinking?

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:50.027Z)

But it doesn't you know, it

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:52.153Z)

Think we are utilizing Mark at this point. I think we could

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:52.377Z)

at least in the conversations I've been in, I haven't really gotten the impression that he's actually actively looking for investment.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:56.053Z)

as far as I know, he has a lot of experience

### You (2025-05-16T18:17:59.107Z)

I think Diane's really the one that's

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:17:59.723Z)

a start up or

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:01.667Z)

running with that. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:01.793Z)

in funding and all that. Right now, I think Diane is more

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:04.517Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:07.723Z)

towards Drew even though, like, he well, we don't know whether he's gonna come on board or not.

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:13.687Z)

Yeah. You can. Yeah. You can get an angel investor who's

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:14.883Z)

If we could activate Mark somehow and, you know,

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:16.747Z)

there to give you some funds to get your get it going. And

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:19.393Z)

help. Diane,

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:21.697Z)

get multiple rounds of investing after that. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:22.463Z)

to raise funding and all that. Then that would be great.

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:26.097Z)

I mean, we will have to have some money coming in to have even a a version one. So Okay. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:38.453Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:18:48.487Z)

Well, we have to have the data. Whether we have an arrangement I mean, if he's in if he's a partner, and, you know, if he allows us access to his database,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:18:56.323Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, if and you can get funding even before you have product for sure.

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:00.157Z)

I think it would be perfectly fair of us for any

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:03.893Z)

That happens.

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:04.147Z)

clients that don't use his service. That we can share the data back with him.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:09.623Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:10.137Z)

I think it could be, you know, you scratch my back, I'll scratch your arrangement. But we have to have

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:16.103Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:17.317Z)

we have to be the keeper of the big bucket. We have to have all that data available to us.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:23.183Z)

Right. And then the other thing I wanted to make sure that, you know, we

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:28.727Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you have anything else you wanted to go over?

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:28.923Z)

kind of not making a app to consume data for true database. Right? Do wanna have database. We do wanna restore all the files because

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:37.627Z)

Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:19:38.093Z)

where everything is. Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T18:19:46.547Z)

Okay. Yeah. Let me make a note of it. I done anything since. That original. No. Well, I did use Claude, but I I found

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:03.913Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:04.117Z)

in one of the resources that I have a really detailed prompt. In fact, I can send it to you Let me let me go ahead and do that. But it it it's not just a, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:15.353Z)

Let me remind you. I don't know what time you said. You wanted to go at 02:15 or something?

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:17.267Z)

log in and say, what are the options? I mean, it it's it uses multiple methods. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:23.943Z)

That thing that immigration thing to

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:25.867Z)

let me

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:27.773Z)

Canada, I just wanted to go through your

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:27.907Z)

me find the actual prompt, and I'll I'll give it to you, and you can

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:31.613Z)

prompt and see what does it say now.

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:31.917Z)

plug in this, you know, information as well.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:33.903Z)

After we give him give it that angle.

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:37.017Z)

But it it it it breaks it down into, like, five different categories of legal advice, like contract, labor, blah blah blah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:20:43.293Z)

Yeah. Where are you getting it from? Chancey pity?

### You (2025-05-16T18:20:47.267Z)

And then different it it uses a an iterative process, like, look at this information, come up with an idea, then review that idea, take a look at and and it it really I was really impressed with the data that came up with. The only thing is I I noticed that the prompt did not specifically request citations, specific links to sources. So I added that in but I haven't tried it since I've added it in. So yeah, I do wanna make sure there's yeah. When I sent that around, it's like, wanna make sure they understand you. This is just something that was spit out. Yeah. I mean, could be hallucinating. Right? I had no idea.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:21:36.213Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-16T18:21:37.277Z)

It sounded pretty legit, but you know, without without having the citations and references, you know, take it with a grain of salt. But I'll I'll load it into the Teams chat after after our call. I'll dig it up and copy it there so you can have a copy.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:26.653Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:22:29.487Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:29.723Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-16T18:22:32.307Z)

We definitely need to do that. I was hoping to do something like that,

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:37.553Z)

Yeah. I was kind of planning to meet some

### You (2025-05-16T18:22:38.087Z)

with that PowerPoint, but I I kinda went off in a slightly different direction. But

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:41.893Z)

autonomy. Yeah, I mean, if we can find something here, then, yeah, probably, we'll see once we have

### You (2025-05-16T18:22:44.887Z)

I I agree. You know? I I just especially with Mark. I don't think Mark I think he's kind of almost expecting too much

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:47.703Z)

doing the actual documentation work.

### You (2025-05-16T18:22:54.277Z)

from version one and POC. I think Drew and Diane have a pretty decent idea of the

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:22:57.693Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. And then

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:01.397Z)

limitations.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:23:02.263Z)

I'm thinking of, like,

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:02.727Z)

But, yeah, I think we have to have Mark understand that, you know, these are all great ideas that you've got, but we can't do it on day

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:23:04.513Z)

just close like, creating some sort of diagram so that we can just understand, like, not the entire visual, but

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:09.927Z)

one. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:23:12.423Z)

some rough diagram where we can close on what exactly we're gonna deliver as part of POC and then probably m MVP.

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:19.107Z)

Yeah. I'll I'll I'll let you know. I'll go ahead and share the PowerPoint and Yeah. That way you can I'll load that up on the team site, share it, make sure you've got access, and we'll go from there.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:23:34.223Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:42.127Z)

Yep. Yep. And if if I'm the only thing on my calendar Monday. So if you still wanna

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:23:45.243Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-16T18:23:47.817Z)

get together before the call, I'm wide open. So just Yeah. Pick a time that works, and we'll go from there. Probably be a bad idea for it to have a call. I'll I'll share all of this stuff today. You can take a look at it over the weekend, and I'll keep plugging away on that. So

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:24:05.023Z)

And then, yeah, if you could please share that PPT that you are showing in the last meeting with the mattresses on the top.

### You (2025-05-16T18:24:11.607Z)

Who?

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:24:13.083Z)

Then put the Yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good.

### You (2025-05-16T18:24:22.577Z)

Oh, yeah. That's that's

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:24:25.813Z)

Cool. Cool. I'll let you go, Howard.

### You (2025-05-16T18:24:27.807Z)

let me let me dig that up.

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:24:29.943Z)

We can we can connect that. I think we already have to call to call it. That the same time on Monday?

### You (2025-05-16T18:24:35.147Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That's that's

### Guest (2025-05-16T18:24:35.813Z)
