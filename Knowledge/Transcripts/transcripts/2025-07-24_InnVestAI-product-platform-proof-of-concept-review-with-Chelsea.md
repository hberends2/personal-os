### Guest (2025-07-24T17:59:52.055Z)

Good afternoon. How are you?

Good. Do have, a

### You (2025-07-24T17:59:58.958Z)

College trip up. Today. Yeah. You know, I figured if we're gonna start talking to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:01.065Z)

collared shirt on today.

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:04.648Z)

potential investors, might as well look the part. So just don't get used to it. Alright. I will. Yeah. I'll put you in your sweatshirt on Monday morning.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:14.735Z)

Alright. I won't. I'll be I'll I'll inspect you in your sweatshirt on Monday morning.

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:17.708Z)

How's your day going? Good. Good. Yep. Yours?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:23.265Z)

Good. Good. Good.

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:23.918Z)

Yeah. Got getting a lot done. I've got

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:25.155Z)

Yep. Yours?

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:27.988Z)

almost all the documentation for Vinod and the team ready to go. So That's good. And I needed 6% through

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:35.615Z)

That's good. And I've made it 60% through the first draft

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:39.958Z)

the first draft. Of the pitch deck. And I don't think it's a research that's not a really good template that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:44.945Z)

of the pitch deck. And I found I did some research. I found a really good template that's

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:46.798Z)

high level and it's not subordinate against

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:50.455Z)

high level

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:51.368Z)

to the point, and I'm gonna using them. And then it's

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:52.925Z)

you know, not wordy, but gets to the point

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:54.418Z)

just it takes a long time to be succinct. Does that make sense? It's, like, easy to write something

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:00:56.205Z)

And I've been using that, and then it's just it takes a long time to be succinct.

### You (2025-07-24T18:00:59.708Z)

And I have to only write two sentences. Yeah. It's

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:01:00.945Z)

That makes sense. It's, like, easy to write something. Write two pages when you actually have to only write two sentences. It's

### You (2025-07-24T18:01:04.318Z)

it's harder. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:01:08.325Z)

it's harder. Yep.

### You (2025-07-24T18:01:12.658Z)

Let me check on something here. I do. It's

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:01:33.325Z)

You like circle back?

### You (2025-07-24T18:01:34.908Z)

I really like the granola but the granola doesn't identify the speakers like Circleback does. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:01:46.795Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:01:47.708Z)

But I I so I I think in terms of the quality of the notes, it it's good. But in terms of well, they're about the same. I would say. But I I've used otter fireflies Actually, the Microsoft Teams isn't bad either. If you're on a Teams meeting and you record it,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:02:11.755Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:02:13.528Z)

we've got Copilot. You can then use Copilot to do all the notes as well. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:02:20.615Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:02:21.148Z)

But, yeah, I I think, you know, I the granola is pretty expensive compared to lot. But I got it for free as part of the newsletter that I get. For for a year. Okay. And circle back is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:02:37.005Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:02:38.748Z)

it's it's it's, like, $25 a month per person. Uh-huh. If we get it,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:02:42.895Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:02:43.488Z)

team subscription, I don't know if it goes down or even if they offer a team subscription. But but, yeah, it's it's really good. But it doesn't do the video. So that's why I think if

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:00.745Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:02.078Z)

if we ever wanted to record something, get the screen, then we definitely wanna use Teams. Okay. How do you guys do?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:10.035Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:12.008Z)

I'm gonna check back on

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:13.725Z)

I'm sorry. I'm gonna jump back off jump off and jump back on because my

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:17.938Z)

have issues with being solved. It's

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:19.395Z)

video isn't working for some reason. I have issues with

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:19.668Z)

give me one second. I'll be right back on. Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:22.925Z)

Teams often. So give me one second. I'll be right back on. Got it.

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:34.608Z)

Was it good idea to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:36.205Z)

Was it good idea to suggest

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:36.248Z)

suggest the note? Third engineer, have AI working out as you're or being focused on AI.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:41.145Z)

to Vinod, the third engineer, have AI

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:44.698Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:45.295Z)

working knowledge or or be focused on AI

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:45.498Z)

Vinod is really, really good, but he's used to being a hands on contributor. Okay. And

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:03:55.145Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:03:55.628Z)

you know, it was kinda, you know, if he's gonna take on this role, he's gonna have to be more supervisory and I mean, he can certainly get in the weeds. I don't think we wanna hand everything over to him. I think Vinod would be good for researching and deciding what is the best tool to use, but I would really feel more comfortable if there were somebody else that was actually you know, helping him to wire it up. That Uh-huh. That has experience. So

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:04:21.345Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:04:24.088Z)

so, yeah, we'll see how that goes. Are those people those people have to be in high demand right now

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:04:28.135Z)

Are those

### You (2025-07-24T18:04:30.518Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:04:31.245Z)

people those people have to be in high demand right now

### You (2025-07-24T18:04:31.788Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They are.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:04:34.685Z)

Right? Yes.

### You (2025-07-24T18:04:35.998Z)

Even even, like, for myself, I've I've I haven't totally given up looking at the job listings, but it's gotten to the point where if you don't have direct hands on AI like building AI, not just Okay. Using it or being familiar with it is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:04:53.175Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:04:54.358Z)

pretty difficult. So hey. Hey. Good afternoon.

Yep. Yep. Howard, if you'd like to let you take over and truly introduce yourself. Oh, well, Chelsea, it's it's pleasure to meet you. As Diane mentioned, I have been in the prop tech space working with Red IQ, but I've actually been in commercial real estate for over thirty years. Pretty much entirely on the multifamily side, you know, I'll I'll give that caveat, but I started off actually in multifamily operations and asset management. Worked with, or worked as vice president of asset management for BH Management Director of Business Intelligence for Bell Partners, so some of the largest companies out the multifamily space. But I got bit by the tech bug back in, around 2010.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:07:35.175Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:07:37.738Z)

You know? People ask me why I switched, and then, you know, I used to say that you know, being an asset manager is fun, but it's you're literally watching the paint dry on the walls. Right? Going through it's nice the before and after, but that in between is just

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:07:52.075Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:07:53.418Z)

grueling. So, tech side fully satisfies the my ADHD and I can keep things going and moving along. So been been doing this for a little over fifteen years now. But we have been with RealPage, some of the larger utility management companies out there, and then, of course, I was a senior product manager and senior of product management for Red IQ when it was owned by Berends. And then sold to Radix last year. So and that's actually when I met Diane. So also from Berends introduced us. And there are five of us on our cofounding team, which is a little bit

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:08:36.325Z)

former role

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:09:32.795Z)

I believe is an investor in the fund. He is all capital markets

### You (2025-07-24T18:09:33.838Z)

And he's the faith. Of what InvestAI for

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:09:37.135Z)

### You (2025-07-24T18:09:37.778Z)

in capital markets.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:09:40.515Z)

And so he's the face of InvestAI for the capital markets. And then I kind of sit in between working working with everyone and kinda putting the vision together based

### You (2025-07-24T18:09:48.188Z)

And all of it I'd to I get more about the broader commercial real estate industry. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:09:52.145Z)

on research I've done over the past five years. And following the the

### You (2025-07-24T18:09:54.218Z)

Nothing. That has been done. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:09:56.335Z)

yellow brick road of the broader commercial real estate industry. Right? What we're doing here is nothing

### You (2025-07-24T18:09:56.798Z)

In the broader CRE space. It's really a combination of do you have

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:01.305Z)

that hasn't been done already.

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:01.508Z)

which is really successful. Platform.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:03.845Z)

In the broader CRE space. It's really a combination of deal path, which is

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:04.708Z)

By journalists. Park. And ABM. Embedded in it, which is like the red IQ. And then eventually,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:08.815Z)

a really successful platform owned by JLL Spark,

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:11.128Z)

it will have, like, a pair of you

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:12.675Z)

an AVM embedded in it, which is like a red eye

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:13.598Z)

which will be an asset management platform

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:16.055Z)

And then eventually, it'll have, like, a pair of you.

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:16.618Z)

But maybe a little bit than the and the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:20.095Z)

Which will be an asset management platform

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:20.288Z)

see the market asset management platform platforms because they're so focused

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:23.115Z)

but maybe a little different than the Michelle Russo and c Warnock asset management platform platforms because

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:24.558Z)

operate. Right? And we're we're more focused a little bit more on we're more focused operationally as well.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:30.115Z)

they're so focused operationally. Right? And we're kinda more focused a little bit more

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:30.618Z)

But really solving the capital markets, the return, see, you know, make that pull through of all the data that exists

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:34.785Z)

We're focused operationally as well, but really solving the

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:38.258Z)

in the workflows

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:39.155Z)

markets, the returns, you you know, like that pull through

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:39.568Z)

as well. So we

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:42.505Z)

of all the data that exists.

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:42.968Z)

where we have a proof of concept

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:44.945Z)

In the workflows as well. Mhmm. So we

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:45.108Z)

And if you're okay, pop it out and just bring it to you,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:49.105Z)

are at the point where we have a proof of concept. And if you're okay, we'd love to

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:49.218Z)

I can just say

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:53.775Z)

pop it up and just show it to you.

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:55.118Z)

on the first stages of the actual MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:10:55.945Z)

Absolutely. It's please keep in mind, it's a proof of concept. And so we're

### You (2025-07-24T18:10:59.158Z)

We have quite a bit of interest. It seems that we may take a

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:00.555Z)

between now and Labor Day on the first stages of the

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:03.278Z)

step up launching this with debt and structured finance because the underwriting is in a higher

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:04.685Z)

MVP. We've had quite a bit of interest. It seems we may take a stab

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:08.808Z)

level than they underwrite, you know, thousands of deals a year. So this product may be better with one or two or three

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:11.875Z)

at launching this with debt and structured finance because the underwriting is at a higher level and they underwrite, you know, like, thousands of deals a year

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:18.328Z)

structure finance grant is interested in helping us

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:20.975Z)

So this product may be better launched with one or two or three debt and structured finance groups. Peachtree is one that's

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:22.738Z)

beta. You know, pilot test this. But and and then then moving to ownership side and then the broker side and then the appraisal side and then the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:30.255Z)

in helping us beta, you know, pilot and test this.

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:32.418Z)

feasibility side. So it's just like there's a lot of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:33.875Z)

But and and then then moving

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:34.768Z)

depth in this opportunity that would create

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:36.925Z)

into the ownership side and then the broker side and then the

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:38.358Z)

but I believe, like, a huge runway to monetizable

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:39.945Z)

appraisal side and then the feasibility side. So it's it's like there's a lot of depth

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:42.948Z)

ARR.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:43.775Z)

in this opportunity.

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:43.868Z)

Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And then, by the way, Howard, just

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:45.765Z)

That will create, I believe, like, a huge

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:47.418Z)

to get some background on what sort of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:49.205Z)

runway to monetizable

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:49.728Z)

stuff the diabetic into. I spent

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:51.715Z)

ARR.

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:51.788Z)

majority of my career in real estate investing, from the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:52.665Z)

Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. And and by the way, Howard,

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:55.228Z)

side of things. So I'm very familiar with

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:56.075Z)

to give you some background on what sort of stuff to dive into,

### You (2025-07-24T18:11:57.598Z)

sort of the ways of working and

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:11:59.815Z)

I spent a majority of my career in real estate investing.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:01.258Z)

this will definitely calm in my heartstrings.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:02.725Z)

From the hospitality side of things. So I'm I'm very familiar with sort of the ways of

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:03.948Z)

Little bit. Right. I wish I had something to this effect.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:07.695Z)

working and

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:10.298Z)

Yeah, definitely

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:10.515Z)

this will definitely pull on my heartstrings.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:11.458Z)

very familiar with kind of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:12.905Z)

A little bit. I'll wish I had something to this effect.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:13.328Z)

this subject matter. Well, good. But the efficiencies exist here. Right? Just because

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:16.345Z)

Although my analysts were fantastic, but

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:18.658Z)

of the data. Yeah. And that's the pain point we're

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:19.395Z)

yeah. I definitely am I'm very familiar with kind of

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:22.028Z)

going right after is trying

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:22.295Z)

this subject matter.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:23.698Z)

to solve the data and the time that we

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:24.345Z)

Right. And the inefficiencies that exist here. Right? Just because of the data

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:27.438Z)

waste on data

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:28.745Z)

and and that's the pain point we're going right after is trying to solve

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:28.788Z)

manipulation, then the processing and the communication that are just replicated over and over and over again. So that's the the pain point

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:33.965Z)

and the time that we waste on data manipulation.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:37.618Z)

that we're out. To.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:38.455Z)

And then the processes and the communication that are just roughly

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:38.888Z)

Solve for you. History. Yeah. And it's interesting. A couple of things before you dive in.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:42.255Z)

over and over and over again. So Right. That's

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:42.978Z)

I've been yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:45.275Z)

the the pain point that we're out to solve for the industry.

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:45.678Z)

Kind of retroactively explore reactivating.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:49.255Z)

Yeah. And it's interesting. Couple of things before you dive in. I've been

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:49.928Z)

Explore more on

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:53.145Z)

kind of retroactively exploring

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:54.358Z)

side. There's also lot of technologies pop up. They're more on multi

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:12:57.485Z)

or reactively exploring more on the residential

### You (2025-07-24T18:12:59.238Z)

which I think is an interesting subject. Talk about. In your

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:03.455Z)

side of things. A lot of technologies

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:03.588Z)

qualitative. Components of of analyzing.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:06.475Z)

up. They're more on multimodal, which I think is an interesting subject

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:07.148Z)

Their seeing video that's translating into

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:10.155Z)

to talk about in your for for more of the qualitative

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:10.798Z)

about, like, the quality of properties. Right? Maybe that's an interest at home.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:13.415Z)

components of of analyzing real estate. Like, they're using video

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:14.758Z)

Commercial. Product. That would be a really interesting component.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:18.385Z)

that's translating into data about, like, the quality of properties. Right? And I think that's an interesting

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:18.678Z)

To have qualitative. Side. Things. Right? Because there's so much of that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:22.935Z)

I've always thought for commercial products that would be a really interesting component

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:23.868Z)

now. I think it's fascinating towards that. But absolutely, I mean, every time, you know, art we summarize what AI

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:27.735Z)

to add that qualitative side of things. Right? Yes. Because there's so much of that that

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:32.178Z)

piece of, like process

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:34.195Z)

think it's fascinating to think towards that. But, absolutely, I mean, every time, you know, our

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:34.248Z)

where human types manipulate down without providing an added layer of context over it right

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:38.865Z)

summarize what AI is to RLPs. I'm like, any process where

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:41.588Z)

It's just the ingestion component of it. And so manual.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:43.835Z)

humans had to manipulate data without providing an

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:46.008Z)

AI is going to replace

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:47.725Z)

added layer of context over it. Right? It's just the ingestion component of it.

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:48.418Z)

sure, replace all of those. Right? Yeah. Well, because those processes are unnecessary.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:52.695Z)

That's so manual. AI is

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:53.688Z)

Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:56.145Z)

going to replace should replace all of those. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:13:56.998Z)

Capabilities and human thinking. Right? It's just the ingestion of it. And I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:13:59.645Z)

Right. Because those processes are unnecessary.

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:01.528Z)

to to second that,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:02.815Z)

Right? Right. They don't include any layer of human

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:03.328Z)

when I transitioned in my

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:06.195Z)

capabilities and human thinking. Right? It's just the ingestion of it. And I think

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:06.278Z)

career on an analyst perform, the basic level.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:10.715Z)

to to second that,

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:10.928Z)

Analysis. Challenging

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:12.565Z)

when I

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:13.428Z)

for me to get familiar with

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:14.365Z)

transitioned in my career to having analysts perform the kind of basic level

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:14.838Z)

the numbers. At the salesperson. Right? There was this disconnect because they

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:19.335Z)

analyses, it was challenging for me to get

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:19.418Z)

were ingesting and manipulating it. Right. And you try to strike this

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:23.105Z)

familiar with the numbers as a deal person.

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:23.928Z)

line between having enough information or where to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:25.985Z)

Right? There was this disconnect because they were the ones ingesting and manipulating it.

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:26.608Z)

came from gut checking it, right? I think this could be a solution for that as well, allowing for

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:30.655Z)

Right. And you try to strike this line

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:31.578Z)

the higher level deal people to have access, understanding,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:33.675Z)

having enough information of where these came from, gut

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:35.678Z)

and a relationship with the numbers as well.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:36.695Z)

checking it. Right? And I think this could be a solution for that as well, allowing for

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:38.588Z)

Yes. Yes. And and Mark is very

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:40.825Z)

the higher level deal people to have access, understanding,

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:41.218Z)

focused on that because he sits in that world too. Every day right now. And so he's very

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:44.865Z)

and a relationship with the numbers as well.

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:46.888Z)

focused on what we wanna be able to and especially engaging with

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:47.535Z)

Yes. Yes. And and Mark is very, very focused

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:50.258Z)

in our platform, we have the ability to track all the changes

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:50.555Z)

focused on that because he sits in that role too, right, every day. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:53.968Z)

that are made. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:54.505Z)

Now. And so he's very focused on we wanna be able and especially if you do it

### You (2025-07-24T18:14:55.478Z)

So have them as this and Howard is much better explaining all of this, but like this, we will have essentially what we

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:14:59.295Z)

in our platform, we have the ability to track all

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:02.028Z)

happened to a model, and

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:02.405Z)

the changes that are made. Right? And so you have then this

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:04.378Z)

I think that's important. And and then and then we are

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:06.405Z)

this well, and Howard is much better explaining all of this, but, like, this log essentially of what's

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:09.718Z)

giving you the proof of concept. I agree on the video.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:11.165Z)

happened to a model. And I think that's important

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:12.468Z)

We're just kind of going at it, they're really high level right now. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:15.595Z)

And and then and then we are when we're giving you the proof of concept, I agree on the video.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:18.768Z)

Like, I see lineage

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:21.675Z)

We're just kind of going at it at a really high level right now.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:21.928Z)

and, like, and acquisition and process. I'll just take one quick example because of so

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:26.615Z)

But, like, on the video, like, I see the

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:28.868Z)

so many hotels

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:29.845Z)

the lineage in, like, brokerage and acquisitions.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:29.998Z)

I really think there's opportunity to create like, video tours of hotels that are

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:34.425Z)

And that process, I'll just take one quick example because I've sold so many hotels.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:35.418Z)

for sale. The GM and the GOSM, of touring between

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:39.395Z)

I really think there's opportunity to create, like, video tours of

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:40.898Z)

13 or 15 times. It's such a waste. Of their

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:43.705Z)

hotels that are for sale with the GM and the DOSM.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:43.708Z)

time and their energy. Right? So, like, transcription, it's like, the video into transcription and into data.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:47.355Z)

Kind of touring because now they tour 13 or 15 times. It's such a waste of their time and energy. Right? So, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:50.488Z)

On the call tape. On the qualitative side is a huge opportunity.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:54.795Z)

the with the transcription, it's like the video into transcription then into data.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:54.848Z)

Yes. Howard, Sure.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:15:59.665Z)

On the quality on the qualitative side is a huge opportunity.

### You (2025-07-24T18:15:59.858Z)

Well, Chelsea, it's good to hear that you're very familiar with the underwriting because I know we only block

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:16:03.375Z)

Mhmm. Yeah. Absolutely.

### You (2025-07-24T18:16:04.168Z)

off a half hour. So

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:16:05.325Z)

Howard, take it away.

### You (2025-07-24T18:16:05.928Z)

to to be respectful of the time, I'm not gonna get too deep into the weeds. But if I ever show you anything while I'm going through here and you want to ask a question or dig down into it, let

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:16:16.365Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:16:17.918Z)

feel free to just jump in and interrupt. So the the workflow is really kind of what I'm gonna focus on now. That's that's really the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:16:23.205Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-24T18:16:26.158Z)

core of the product. I think you're gonna start to catch on to what some of the ancillary benefits are as we go through here. One of them being you know, automating the process that you mentioned, before. So, you know, one of the the core product or one of the core features, obviously, is having a pipeline. And know, this could be five deals, 5,500. It doesn't make any difference. Right? So if I as a user, come across a deal, can just do And we're gonna go through and we're gonna fill in these property Now this one, I do wanna kinda show here. I've got some required fields. I'm just gonna put in some gibberish so we can get past this. And property type we'll say full service option one. Click on next. Oh, that's I didn't wanna see. Oh, crap. Okay. Sorry about this. My password manager thinks that I'm filling in something with my name, and it always pops up there. There we go. And a lot of what this is going to be doing then is setting up the the deal So you might be underwriting a resort that's got all sorts of amenities, whether it be, you know, with food and beverage, other operated, miscellaneous. So we're trying to tailor the experience of underwriting to to be based only on what you need. Yeah. Yeah. So no more hiding rows. You know, or inserting something that you missed. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:18:15.275Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:18:15.678Z)

In fact, we mean get down into into greater detail.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:18:17.355Z)

No more deleting line items.

### You (2025-07-24T18:18:19.058Z)

For some of these. So, you know, if I have a golf course, full service

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:18:21.845Z)

Yeah. Great.

### You (2025-07-24T18:18:23.098Z)

spa, bar and lounge, you might have a

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:18:23.585Z)

Great.

### You (2025-07-24T18:18:25.088Z)

a wine bar. Right? So as we go through and we select those items, those are the items we're gonna be viewing. Now for the proof of concept right now, it's only at the food and beverage other operated etcetera, the high level right there. But this is one of the very first steps where we're start gonna we're we're automating. Right? And we had a very successful program at Rede and, quite frankly, a lot of our competitors especially using AI now. It's very, very good. At parsing data. Out of documents. So if you're a broker, you're an investor, or or anybody if you get the documents from the seller, you can just, go ahead and upload the files. You can drag and drop, or you can just go ahead and and use the the choose files selector option to have that come up You can indicate then if is it a financial statement? Is it an STR report? Because we are gonna allow users to upload their STR reports so they can see them. We'll have other options here as we build out. Then when I click on save, the next thing it's gonna do is it's gonna take me now to the market data. So let's just say I uploaded a STI report here. You can see

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:19:38.905Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:19:39.348Z)

pretty much the STR report, but we are gonna add a couple things like we can edit If there's something that we wanna add or change in the particular report, maybe it's not the most recent number, we can do that. If we want that deal to not be included, we can delete it. But over and above this, we also have two other things. We know that, you know, it it it happens every day in multifamily, and I been told that it's very common in hospitality as well that you're gonna get on the phone and you're gonna call. The, you know, the cops that are right in the area. So we've got two different sections here. We've got operating statistics, and transaction summary. So, you know, we may have

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:20:19.965Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:20:20.258Z)

a comp one, and we can go through here and we can input, you know, what year did is this data for, the current year, prior year, how many rooms, what is their occupancy, it'll and the ADR, it'll calculate the RevPAR. We can put notes. And I can input as many comp properties as I want. Transactions, same thing. I might have my own list of sales that have taken place in that area. So I could put in the property name, the year it sold, all of this information above who who is a buyer, seller, etcetera. And and same thing. I can just continue to add as many properties as I want. To build up a really robust comp dataset in here. Okay? And data. Ingestion. I thinking towards down the line

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:17.105Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:17.468Z)

to develop

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:21.825Z)

And real quick on on sort of the data ingestion.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:22.628Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Because I feel like be

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:26.045Z)

And granted totally understand what stage this is in,

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:27.948Z)

Like, later. In the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:29.125Z)

there any thinking towards down the line developing this

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:29.528Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Search and yeah. It's not gonna be that far down the line.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:32.745Z)

to be more automated so it can search the Internet? Right? Like, search the Internet for things. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:33.968Z)

Yeah. I don't know that it's gonna be available in a few weeks when we release our

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:37.655Z)

Because I feel like that's also that would be a

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:39.148Z)

p, but Yeah. We're already working on that.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:40.395Z)

insanely helpful component like, layering in that

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:44.208Z)

Out of the Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:44.225Z)

search and yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:48.148Z)

You start to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:49.445Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:50.278Z)

layers of this like also being able to speak

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:53.945Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:54.108Z)

to it. And say, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:55.385Z)

Yeah. No. I mean, this is already a

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:55.618Z)

I'm I'm thinking about including some

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:21:58.405Z)

of where how everyone does the process today. I think where

### You (2025-07-24T18:21:58.488Z)

sort of or I found that a an that's taking place. In three years, like the Super Bowl. Yeah. And how should I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:02.775Z)

you start to envelop the more advanced layers of this, like, also being able to

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:06.088Z)

about layering that into the top line performance

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:08.115Z)

speak to it and say, you know, I think I'm thinking about including

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:09.908Z)

or that that performance. And the projections. Right? Things like that.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:12.635Z)

some sort of or I found a an event that's taking place

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:13.438Z)

Okay. Yeah. No. Absolutely. So without going down,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:17.125Z)

in three years, like the Super Bowl. And how should I think about layering that

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:18.238Z)

two four. Going. Put that on the Drew key. Right? We're also

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:21.975Z)

into the top line performance or that that year's performance in the projection

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:22.208Z)

working on like, right now, Drew does not have actual APIs with the management companies.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:26.645Z)

Right? Things like that. Mhmm. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:28.388Z)

He's getting

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:28.935Z)

And

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:29.498Z)

the data asset management clients. Right? The hotels that they own from the managers.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:30.565Z)

and just one quick thing before keep going is that on the Drew piece, right, we're also working on

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:34.998Z)

But it's still coming in a fairly new

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:38.175Z)

like, right now, Drew does not have actual APIs with the management companies.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:38.258Z)

digitized process. But that's something he's on. Seems very confidentially in the strategic

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:43.145Z)

He's getting the data from his asset management

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:45.548Z)

partnership with Profit Sword.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:46.315Z)

clients, right, the hotels that they own from the managers.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:47.228Z)

So that's what works with him. Then we're also thinking about how we potentially get in front of them through and other

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:49.605Z)

But it's still coming in a fairly manual digitized process.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:54.028Z)

so that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:54.575Z)

Mhmm. But that is something he's working on, please, just very confidentially.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:55.128Z)

we can eventually, like, dropping

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:22:59.035Z)

Mhmm. A strategic partnership with Profit Sword. So that's in the works with him.

### You (2025-07-24T18:22:59.968Z)

in here. The data is just getting transferred from the managers, right, directly into a

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:04.005Z)

And then we're also thinking about how we potentially get in front of m three and others

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:05.508Z)

InvestAI. But we're not there yet, and that will probably take us about twelve months. I think probably about twelve from. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:08.975Z)

so that we can eventually, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:12.098Z)

That

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:12.215Z)

we're not

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:12.478Z)

that's a great idea. And there's also a lot of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:12.905Z)

dropping files in here. The data is

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:15.478Z)

technologies being built out around

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:16.135Z)

just getting transferred from the managers. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:17.818Z)

work. Work flow and sort of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:19.155Z)

Directly into InnVestAI. But we're not there yet, and that will probably take us about

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:21.528Z)

work files. Management. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:23.255Z)

twelve month I think probably about twelve months from the launch. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:24.198Z)

So, like, you're there I'm probably terrible at explaining this, but you're uploading all of your

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:26.635Z)

That that's a great idea. And there's also a lot of

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:28.818Z)

files into the system or you have all of your files in the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:30.225Z)

technologies being developed about around work work

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:32.018Z)

system and using AI.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:33.425Z)

flow and sort of

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:34.138Z)

Facilitate new pieces of work. Right? So those programs, I'm sure you would be able

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:36.195Z)

work files management. Right? So, like, you're they're I'm probably terrible at explaining this, but you're uploading all of your files into this

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:40.458Z)

log into as well eventually down the line. On these groups. Like, sort of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:44.365Z)

system or you house all of your files in the system and using AI.

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:45.068Z)

sort of absorbing them. So that it's it's basically you

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:48.675Z)

Helps you facilitate

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:49.008Z)

function says, hey,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:50.205Z)

new pieces of work. Right? Mhmm. So those programs, I'm sure you would be able to

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:50.508Z)

know, you have supporting evidence from another hotel two years ago in this

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:55.115Z)

plug into as well eventually down the line when these groups, like, sort of

### You (2025-07-24T18:23:55.598Z)

same It might not be a current asset, but you've looked at an asset before in the same market. Here's that competitive data. Right? Yep. Things that you

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:23:59.575Z)

start absorbing them so that it's it's basically your function says, hey. You know, you have

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:04.158Z)

think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:06.245Z)

supporting evidence from another hotel two years ago in this same

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:07.078Z)

Right? The analyst is using SMA over two year kind of term.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:11.215Z)

it might not be a current asset, but you've looked at an asset

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:12.308Z)

And it's, maybe three years ago, another analyst deaf.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:14.235Z)

before in the same market. Here's that competitive data. Right? Things that

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:15.518Z)

Information out of this same. Right? So that that sort of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:18.035Z)

you wouldn't think

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:18.268Z)

that's something to also think about. There was some

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:19.715Z)

you might the analyst might not even know. Right? Say an analyst is using this, and they are a two year kind of

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:21.188Z)

large number those products that I've seen that are that are interesting. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:25.405Z)

turn. Mhmm. And it's like, hey. Three years ago, another analyst downloaded this information, add this in. Right? So that that sort of

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:26.538Z)

Plug right into that. Yep. Yep. Yep. Remind me when I get down to the very end here. I I will

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:33.035Z)

that's something to also think about. There's

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:34.588Z)

update you on

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:35.495Z)

a large number of those products that I've seen

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:37.228Z)

what exactly we're looking at for the early stages of AI in the mid stages

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:38.675Z)

that are that are interesting, and I bet you could plug right into that.

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:41.888Z)

I think you're gonna see that we're actually gonna be

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:24:42.985Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:24:44.738Z)

pretty well down the road very early in in the process here. So so any other questions there in the property details or market data? I don't think so. Alright. So following the path of, you know, the underwriter, the business analyst, next thing we would do is the valuation assumptions. So

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:25:03.805Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:25:04.248Z)

same thing here. So we would put in, you know, do we have a discount rate

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:25:08.085Z)

I don't think so.

### You (2025-07-24T18:25:08.258Z)

what cap rate are we underwriting? Do we have acquisition costs associated, this is actually a manual input now, but I'll show you here a few minutes where this will actually be based on your actual projections when you go through the underwriting. Replacement reserve, etcetera. So anything that I do here on the acquisition side will will populate this information down here. Then I'll go to the financing tab, do the same thing. What is the loan to value? What is the interest rate? Etcetera. Closing costs here. This is this is one that we just recently changed. You can just use a flat percentage of the loan. Like a lot of people do, or if you wanna do a real detailed line line, you can select the detail option, and then this section comes live where you can input all sorts of line item detail all of which when then will come down and populate the lender fees. So whichever way you prefer, you've got the option of of doing there.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:26:03.995Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:26:07.778Z)

And then on the exit cap rates here and and sales expense, your assumptions, help to come down and and populate your exit assumptions. So you can see we're kind of setting up the process now of of looking at the full life cycle of of this deal. And once we've gotten through that, oh, this is another thing I want to point out. Notice at the top now, we have some investment KPI cards. Now this is just static data that was typed in just as an example. The same thing here is as you go through in any of these fields in blue throughout the application, These are the user inputs. And the calculation is real time. There isn't a button to calculate or anything. So, anytime that you change one of these numbers, you'll see the effect of that throughout the model. So if I go to the pro form a page, you've got the same thing up here, the cards. But you also have a key metrics table up here. This will always be visible. You can see as I scroll down the page, that's always visible. And, again, everything on here will change in real time as I make changes down here. So I'll have my certain key metrics here gross operating profit, the GLBPAR, percentage of revenue, a bit etcetera. On the occupancy tab, the basic occupancy metrics there, Revenue, you've got the same thing, the ADR, the RevPAR. Total other operated revenue rolled up I can go ahead and expand that, and I can see all the individual departments. And then same thing on the expense. You can go ahead and and and change that as well to see the roll ups And then, again, don't wanna go line by line. But the way it's set up is every item here that's shaded in yellow indicates a user input. And each one of these will give you a certain option. Right? So we've tried to make it flexible for whatever way you preferred. To to to budget, or to forecast. Back at the beginning, when I uploaded those documents, in the property details, you know, whatever historical information I'll have will be here on the left. In this deal, I've got four years. You know, it could be one, it be three, whatever. Whatever you upload will be displayed here. And then I put in a five year hold

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:28:36.925Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-24T18:28:39.048Z)

for the deal, so I got five years of forecast data. Down here on the expense, this is one thing I will show you. You've got the options to budget the expenses on a per occupied unit basis. Percentage of revenue, or I can just put a manual input here. And you can see whatever option I choose it will calculate the historical based on that. So, so for per occupied, for the rooms expense there, $43.46 dollars as percentage of revenue, it'll calculate. But if I just wanna do manual input, you know, it's the same as the historical. And then, one of the things that really separates this and this is what we wanted to do for an AVM, is where a lot of models out there will get down to the total expense or maybe the a bit per row. We will get down to the net operating income and even the CapEx. So I had input a 4% reserve for replacement on that It's my 4% there, calculate the net operating income. And then I can go ahead and put in as many capex items as I want, you know, if I wanna add an new roof, that falls into the building exterior, and it might be year two. And it might be, you know, $350,000. And so I can keep adding items here. Just like in the other areas, I may have a very large CapEx budget and might have as many items as I want. I can just keep on going. So so that's really the Yeah. Heart of the product right there. Yeah. Yeah. You know, looking through a medicine. Course this is just my weekend. It's not necessarily a reflection of the things that you guys were discussing on the product side. I feel like the key to success in this area is, like, at functionality done in a way and a workflow

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:37.705Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:38.958Z)

that it's is typical. Right? Like, I think that you're nailing that. This is exactly the way I worked on what

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:42.475Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, as I'm

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:45.428Z)

models I think I was on I have a couple of

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:46.015Z)

walking through this and, of course, this is just my me giving advice

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:48.188Z)

third a couple of operators. So we definitely wanted more details and say, thanks

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:50.175Z)

not necessarily a reflection of the things that you guys are discussing on the product side.

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:52.688Z)

to you on, like, the operating pro form a.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:54.545Z)

I feel like the key to success in this area

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:55.658Z)

But and then on the second part of side, I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:30:57.575Z)

obviously, getting the functionality done in a

### You (2025-07-24T18:30:58.438Z)

that might be 25%, 50%, 75 If

way and a workflow that it's is

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:03.048Z)

you know, over time advancing.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:04.205Z)

Right? Like and I think that you're nailing that.

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:05.418Z)

The level of data ingestion. Yes. On the quantitative front, like, that's gonna

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:07.225Z)

This is exactly the way I worked on my models. I think I was on

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:10.268Z)

ultimately be the the the key to success, I think, in this is if you can ingest

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:11.505Z)

at a couple of third a couple of operators, and so we definitely went in more

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:14.958Z)

down

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:15.455Z)

detail than, say, banks do on, like, the operating pro form a.

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:15.498Z)

even better than humans can. Right? Because you can scrape the Internet the way how it lets do. You can scrape

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:19.645Z)

But and then on the second part aside, I think

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:22.328Z)

the the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:22.945Z)

that might be 25% key to success. This being 75 is

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:23.478Z)

the thought drawing you know, haven't had fun. I don't know that some hidden

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:27.735Z)

know, over time advancing the level of data ingestion.

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:28.678Z)

file from some transaction or potential transaction years ago. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:32.135Z)

On the quantitative, right, like, that's gonna ultimately be the

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:32.778Z)

I think that's gonna be ultimately the key to success is saying, like,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:35.705Z)

the the key to success, I think, in this is if you can ingest data

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:36.618Z)

this could analyze better than humans. Right? Because it's automated. Yeah. But I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:39.895Z)

even better than humans can, right, because you can scrape

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:42.168Z)

way you constructed it

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:42.915Z)

the Internet the way LLMs do. You can scrape the

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:43.568Z)

so far is exact the way. What that it

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:47.475Z)

the the box drives

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:47.528Z)

It's know, this is challenging to use and understand.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:49.395Z)

you know, that the company has that I might not know that's

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:50.768Z)

People are be apprehensive to adopting it. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:52.505Z)

some hidden file from some transaction or potential transaction years ago. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:54.308Z)

More apprehensive than, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:31:57.235Z)

I think that's gonna be ultimately the key to success is saying, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:31:57.328Z)

if it if it wasn't. So I think the way that you guys have built it out so far is is fantastic. It makes a lot of sense. Well, thank you.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:01.015Z)

this can analyze better than humans. Right? Because it's automated. But I think that the way that you've constructed it

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:04.928Z)

Thank you. Easy to understand. Very easy to follow-up, which is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:08.025Z)

so far is exactly the way I would that it it's

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:08.408Z)

perfect. Yeah. You know, I think a lot of products

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:12.635Z)

know, if this is challenging to use and understand,

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:12.728Z)

sometimes, it's just in general, forget that component.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:15.335Z)

are gonna be apprehensive to adopting it. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:15.768Z)

They're building it to be smarter and faster, but not necessarily

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:18.185Z)

Mhmm. More apprehensive than, you know, if it if it wasn't

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:18.928Z)

as adaptable. And that's a big issue in the real hospitality industry, adoptability technology. Well, because it's so

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:22.795Z)

So I think the way that you guys have built it out so far is is fantastic.

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:25.968Z)

driven. Right? Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:27.195Z)

And makes a lot of sense. Very easy to understand.

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:27.338Z)

So think it's fantastic.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:30.665Z)

Very easy to follow, which is perfect.

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:31.418Z)

Going, and I'm not sort of I I do have to jump. I just

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:33.865Z)

You know, I think a lot of

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:34.238Z)

pushed my butt, but

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:36.255Z)

products sometimes, just in general,

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:36.358Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:38.975Z)

forget that component. They're building it to be smarter and faster, but not

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:39.358Z)

so what you know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:42.925Z)

as adoptable. And that's a big issue in the real estate

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:43.768Z)

when do you think you'll start if you have already? Pushing this?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:46.575Z)

industry is adoptability of technology because it's so human driven.

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:47.348Z)

Towards university? Couple? You know. Contract with clients or users or whatnot.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:50.885Z)

Right? Mhmm. So I think it's fantastic. I

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:52.508Z)

What are some of the next milestones do you think? So

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:55.485Z)

I was going to ask sort of I I do have to jump. I just

### You (2025-07-24T18:32:55.658Z)

first milestone is Labor Day. I mean, we're up eyes on Labor Day.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:32:58.715Z)

pushed my callback by by ten minutes, but the 1149

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:00.178Z)

You have to have approach portion of it. MVP which is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:03.885Z)

was gonna ask, so what are kind of the next steps for you all as you're

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:04.368Z)

cloud or you saw

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:08.025Z)

you know, when do you think you'll start, if you haven't already, pushing this

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:09.238Z)

offshore software developers right now. One is working on

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:12.795Z)

towards your first couple of, you know, contracts or clients or users or whatnot?

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:13.038Z)

the front end, one is working on the back end. End. So we hope to have something that is that's actually cloud based

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:17.705Z)

What are some of the next milestones do you think?

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:17.928Z)

with sign on security and all of that by

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:20.725Z)

So the first milestone is Labor Day. I mean, we're all eyes

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:21.518Z)

We did that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:24.615Z)

on Labor Day. We hope to have a version of an MVP which is in the cloud. Right? Our

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:29.048Z)

Peachtree as a group that would

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:31.445Z)

our the nodes team, and we have two off

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:32.118Z)

help pilot us with this. Think their credit team is the right team to start because they can't

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:35.065Z)

software developers right now. One is working on the front end. One is working on the back

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:37.778Z)

start it at a five level run rate.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:39.915Z)

end. So we hope to have something that that's actually cloud based

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:40.068Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:43.535Z)

with sign ons and security and all of that by Labor Day. We've had some and, please, this is very confidential. I'm just saying this to you because

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:51.868Z)

We are talking

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:51.985Z)

we've had some initial discussion with

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:53.758Z)

to Access Financial,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:54.695Z)

Peachtree as a group that would

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:55.868Z)

I'm gonna approach Stacy now.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:33:57.675Z)

help pilot us with this there, but they think it's their credit team is the right team to start.

### You (2025-07-24T18:33:58.538Z)

Western Craig, I think she would have meant like something like this.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:02.645Z)

Because, again, it started at a high level. Right? Right.

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:05.418Z)

I don't know. I'll call three clients that would work with us on it.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:05.725Z)

Where the underwriting is at a higher level. And then and then we can work over time to build out the modules that are needed for more complex

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:10.958Z)

Put for big work.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:13.985Z)

revenue, more complex food and beverage, more right.

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:15.068Z)

Wanna make sure we make and you were talking about it like the the tool itself.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:17.715Z)

We are talking to Access Financial.

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:20.208Z)

That simple.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:21.335Z)

I'm gonna approach Stacy Naldoni at Western Bank. Right? I think she would Mhmm. Like something like this. It's our goal is to

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:28.558Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:29.955Z)

try to get I don't know, I'll call it three clients that would work with us

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:31.708Z)

200 k

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:34.415Z)

on it. We're not gonna be initially, we're not going for big revenues. Right? We're going for

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:36.848Z)

you know, through on the first year. But what that will allow us to do is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:39.385Z)

want user feedback. We wanna make sure we nail the

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:41.858Z)

September through, I'll call it the end

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:43.185Z)

you were talking about it, like, the the tool itself,

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:43.918Z)

of the year,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:45.945Z)

that it's simple to use, easy to use,

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:46.818Z)

and work with them. But at the same time,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:49.025Z)

then we wanna make sure we just nail the data ingestion, and we nail, like, you know,

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:49.398Z)

September, we're gonna start to look for pre seed capital. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:53.245Z)

all of that. So our first year, we probably won't

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:54.088Z)

Between mean, it's probably something like

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:34:56.465Z)

I mean, maybe 200 k in ARR. I mean, that that I mean,

### You (2025-07-24T18:34:57.198Z)

$202,150,000 dollars from September day

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:00.475Z)

like, that we're not looking to

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:01.018Z)

to March. For us to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:02.715Z)

you know, blow through on the first year.

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:03.918Z)

you know, work through that. And get

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:05.765Z)

But what that will allow us to do is September through

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:05.858Z)

it to. A a a large better MVP. And then

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:09.145Z)

call it, the end of the year, we bring on our beta clients and work with them

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:09.678Z)

that point, gonna be looking for you know, the church in capital, which now is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:13.875Z)

But at the same time, in September, we're gonna start to look for pre seed capital.

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:14.968Z)

something like $3.03 and a half million for us over a two year period.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:18.635Z)

And between I mean, it's probably something like

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:18.988Z)

Most of it will be dedicated on the, you know, the AI side, the technology side. But also, we'll have a very

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:23.045Z)

$202,150,000 dollars from September day to March.

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:25.818Z)

small team We'll have nine to 15 people, but

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:28.085Z)

Mhmm. For us to, you know, work through this

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:28.828Z)

gonna take our team out there, like, upfront capital, CapEx, and pay

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:31.105Z)

and get it to a a a much better MVP.

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:33.008Z)

Sprite. We're gonna tackle legal work.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:34.665Z)

Mhmm. And then at that point, we're gonna be looking for the

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:34.848Z)

Workflows. We're gonna tackle closing workflows.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:38.055Z)

you know, the true seed capital, which is probably something like $3.03 and a half million us over a two year period where most of it will be dedicated

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:38.438Z)

But that's what we'll be spending our time That's great. I I think that, you know, maybe it's September would be a good time to or, you know, September, October when

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:47.095Z)

on the, you know, the AI side, the technology side. But also,

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:48.228Z)

kinda have started working with those groups and have

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:50.925Z)

we'll have a very small team. I mean, 10 to 15 people, but

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:51.588Z)

hit another bigger milestone. And if there are any product updates as well to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:54.545Z)

it's gonna take our team out there. Like, I'll probably tackle CapEx and pips. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:35:56.648Z)

to to reconnect. You know, to be totally transparent from a fund side,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:35:59.485Z)

We're gonna tackle legal workflows. We're gonna tackle closing workflows.

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:00.388Z)

from from a fund perspective, we really

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:03.495Z)

But that's what we'll be spending our time on.

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:04.208Z)

war torn c seed series a once there's been more monetization. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:06.725Z)

That's great. Well, I I think that, you know, maybe in

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:09.408Z)

That's not say that we don't form relationships with products before that. It's just from, like, an investment lens

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:10.375Z)

would be a good time to or, you know, September, October when you kind of have started working with those groups and have

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:14.748Z)

I would say for your pre seed, go in the angel route with

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:17.565Z)

hit another, like, bigger milestone, and if there are any product

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:19.018Z)

high network individuals in the real estate space.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:21.455Z)

updates as well to to reconnect. You know, to be totally transparent from a fun size,

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:21.968Z)

I mean, like, you have the they're gonna understand this. Mhmm. That they're wealthy.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:26.305Z)

from a fund's perspective, we really veer more towards seed

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:27.248Z)

And, you know, they're looking for private investments all the time. And I think, you know, talk to Barry.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:31.185Z)

c to series a once there's been more monetization. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:32.918Z)

You know, talk to, you know, the the sort of relationships I think you have

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:35.195Z)

That's not to say that we don't form relationships with products before that. It's just from, like, an investment

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:37.188Z)

That that would be an incredible start. Right? Right. I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:39.925Z)

lens. I would say for your pre seed,

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:40.288Z)

also when you have the opportunity to get that sort of angel funding

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:43.065Z)

going the angel route with

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:44.708Z)

from people that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:44.995Z)

high net worth individuals in the real estate space.

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:46.298Z)

would be users and people leave in the product and put some even better story. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:47.875Z)

I mean, like, you have the they're gonna understand this.

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:51.128Z)

I think that would be a fantastic

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:51.735Z)

Mhmm. And they're wealthy. And Right. You know, they're looking for private investments

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:53.608Z)

sort of way to start thinking for your angel perspective or

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:55.685Z)

all the time. And I think, you know, talk to Barry.

### You (2025-07-24T18:36:56.748Z)

proceed because that's a completely different network.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:36:58.945Z)

You know, talk to, you know, the the sort of relationships I think you have

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:00.278Z)

You know, institutional venture investors or private equity investors, like,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:03.375Z)

that that would be an incredible start. Right? Right. And I think also

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:06.118Z)

it's a complete different structure. It's

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:07.325Z)

when you have the opportunity to get that sort of angel funding

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:07.698Z)

hard to break into because you kinda use them once. You know, when

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:11.155Z)

from people that would be users and they believe in the product Right. That tells an even better

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:11.318Z)

from an investment perspective, you definitely use their network that I would I think

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:16.065Z)

story.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:16.378Z)

build is really impressive enough people would gravitate

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:16.575Z)

Right? I think that would be a fantastic

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:18.738Z)

towards it. At this

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:19.865Z)

sort of way to start thinking for your angel perspective or proceed because that's

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:20.538Z)

that stage. That's kind of what I would suggest from

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:24.175Z)

it's a completely different network.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:24.608Z)

really that that that that milestone of investing. Then when you get

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:26.595Z)

You know, than the institutional venture investors.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:29.538Z)

more towards the seed

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:30.425Z)

Or private equity investors, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:30.618Z)

side, you can start talking, I think, fortunes and and that term.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:32.455Z)

it's a completely different structure. It's it's hard to break into because you kinda use them once.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:34.088Z)

Funds.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:36.525Z)

You know? And for from an investment perspective, you definitely use their network. But

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:37.608Z)

We're talking about when we get to the $3.03 and a half million. Right? Yeah. And what we've been

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:41.385Z)

I would I think what you've built is really impressive and that people would gravitate towards it.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:42.428Z)

seeing from Steve, like, pretty for one, maybe pre seed. People call

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:45.875Z)

At this this stage. And and that's kind of what I would suggest from

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:48.168Z)

different things. But what we and those targets move.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:51.515Z)

really where that that

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:52.348Z)

All the time.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:53.005Z)

that milestone of investing. Then when you get more

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:53.388Z)

Right? Like, 2021 the tech bust

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:37:56.235Z)

towards the seed side is when you can start talking, I think, more to the the venture funds.

### You (2025-07-24T18:37:56.318Z)

target blew up stage 15. You know, later excuse me. What we

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:01.205Z)

So when you're talking seed, are you talking about

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:01.248Z)

can see from from seeing right now

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:04.045Z)

well, you're talking about when we get to the $3.03 and a half million. Right? Yeah. And so what we've been

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:04.598Z)

aggressive aggressive products are raising 2,000,000 at 20 to 25,000,000.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:08.925Z)

seeing from seed like, pre seed can be angel money. It could be pre seed. People

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:10.968Z)

Mhmm. They went same note. That's in the clause

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:13.685Z)

called rounds different things. But what we and those targets move all the time. Right? Like, 2021, the the tech bust

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:18.318Z)

seen series a that's good for when you are reaching a see that things have been a little more

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:22.725Z)

targets blew up. They shifted, you know, later. Excuse me.

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:24.308Z)

inflated. Know, I'm

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:26.975Z)

What we've been seeing from from seed right now, the aggressive

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:27.118Z)

if you can, I would go for 2,000,000 that last eighteen months rather than

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:31.945Z)

products are raising 2,000,000 at a $2,025,000,000 valuation.

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:32.428Z)

3,000,000 that lasted two years? If I were you. Okay. That's great. Yeah. Because I think for

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:37.455Z)

Mhmm. They raise it on a safe note. That's, like Mhmm. The quasi

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:38.598Z)

too is a bit more know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:41.225Z)

We've seen a lot more seed activity than we've seen series a.

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:41.438Z)

this is this is not a pure it is pure technology. But

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:46.195Z)

So that's a little bit good for when you are raising a seed that things have been a little more inflated. Mhmm. You know, I would if you

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:50.898Z)

This is something more of a a used product. Right? And so I think that you see some of these

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:38:54.185Z)

can, I would go for 2,000,000 that last you eighteen months rather than 3,000,000 that last you two years?

### You (2025-07-24T18:38:56.208Z)

API. Fully stopped that brings, like, 25,000,000 out of 60,000,000 value. I thought something is one to to tap the company called

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:00.955Z)

If I were you. Okay. That's great feedback. Thank you. Yeah. Because I think raising 2 is a bit more you know, this is this is not a

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:09.258Z)

But it's something that's more reasonable and approachable would be an

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:09.965Z)

pure it it is pure technology, but it's not this, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:13.788Z)

Two

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:13.975Z)

API level infrastructure that moves super quickly.

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:15.208Z)

twenty million dollars. 25,000,000 allocation.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:17.445Z)

This is something more of a a use product. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:19.378Z)

That's that's the range and the target that I just

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:20.465Z)

And so I think that you see some of these API fluffy stuff that raise, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:22.298Z)

been seeing. Recently. It might change a couple months, definitely changed since a couple

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:25.805Z)

25,000,000 out of 60,000,000 valuation. I saw this one voice

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:26.828Z)

of months ago. But I think more frequently than last

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:31.505Z)

to to data company called Aola. They did that recently. It's just an example.

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:31.618Z)

frequently and sometimes better. Because it shows healthy. Progression. That's great. Thank you. And then when we get to that 2,000,000 page,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:36.265Z)

But I think something that's more reasonable and approachable would be the two at a 20,000,000 valuation, 25,000,000 valuation.

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:39.588Z)

is that when I mean, come back to you in September, but we'll be sure to get to that 2,000,000 seats

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:44.775Z)

Mhmm. That's

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:45.358Z)

stage. That. Stage for

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:46.565Z)

that's the range and the target that I've just been seeing more recently. It might change in a couple of months. It's definitely changed since a couple of months ago, but I think raising more frequently than less frequently is sometimes better

### You (2025-07-24T18:39:57.188Z)

couple of thousand it would be

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:39:59.955Z)

because it shows healthy progression.

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:01.798Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:02.675Z)

That's great. Thank you. And then when we get to that 2,000,000 phase, is that when

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:04.828Z)

can I

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:07.135Z)

mean, come back to you in September, but when we truly get to that 2,000,000 seed stage, is that the stage where there would be, like, an

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:09.118Z)

really healthy? That's you know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:15.485Z)

interest? Or We would consider it. Definitely. It

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:15.998Z)

at least. That would be

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:18.925Z)

depends how much like, I'd rather see some revenue traction

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:19.748Z)

fantastic.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:22.235Z)

Right? Like, if you can get a couple 100,000 in revenue traction, I think that's appropriate. Like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:26.248Z)

Okay. Yep. I'm not sure we get that far, but, I mean, I don't know. I mean, we're I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:29.345Z)

know, because if you have 500 Yeah. K, then that's a 40 multiple.

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:32.668Z)

just have to, like,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:34.215Z)

Right? So that's that's really healthy. That's a big multiple.

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:34.448Z)

Lord price again right now. You know? But this is

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:38.195Z)

Right. If you can aim for 500 k and and, you know, ARR at least,

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:45.138Z)

by that.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:45.235Z)

that would be fantastic. And you're one. In year one? By the time you raise seed.

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:51.768Z)

Okay. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:53.115Z)

By the time you raise seed. Okay. Yep.

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:53.308Z)

Just because to be totally transparent, you have these, like, sex

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:55.105Z)

I'm not sure we'd get that far. But, I mean, I don't know. I

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:57.628Z)

tech concepts that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:40:58.485Z)

I mean, we're I mean, we just have to, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:40:59.548Z)

rings at, like, frothy

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:00.655Z)

we're working through pricing it right now, and and we're, you know,

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:01.058Z)

undervalued prices. They might have $0, but it's a it's a subject matter that people are, like,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:04.425Z)

But but this is fantastic feedback because we might be able to. We just we're just

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:07.048Z)

drool over. They can get away with it. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:08.945Z)

taking it step by step. A little bit more angel

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:10.038Z)

Right. Something like a little bit more like substantive and like

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:11.935Z)

raising. Right? And maybe it maybe you're closer to

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:14.778Z)

you know, some of the workflow and the

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:15.675Z)

300 k. I would definitely have a couple of 100 k.

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:18.088Z)

that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:18.525Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:18.588Z)

I would I would have number of this

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:19.495Z)

Yeah. Just because the the to be totally transparent, you have these, like, sexy tech

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:20.468Z)

to back it up. That's gonna be more security. Going into it. Okay. And, yeah, I'm so sorry. I have to

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:25.185Z)

concepts that raise at, like, frothy, overvalued prices.

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:26.758Z)

to jump right next call, but we can definitely talk in more depth about this. I would

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:29.345Z)

They might have $0, but it's a it's a subject matter that people are like, drooling over. They can get away with it. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:33.828Z)

raise more, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:36.885Z)

Right. But I think when you build something that's a little bit more, like, substantive and, like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:40.438Z)

you sell it push for revenue,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:41.625Z)

you know, based on more workflow and Yeah. And that I would I would have numbers to back it up. That's gonna give you more security going

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:45.398Z)

some sort of traction, but I think maybe you play with that and and we can

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:50.005Z)

it. Okay. And

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:51.048Z)

reconvene. You know,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:52.235Z)

I'm so sorry. I have to to jump on this next call, but we can definitely talk in more depth

### You (2025-07-24T18:41:52.838Z)

prevent the other yeah. In this

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:41:56.605Z)

about this. I would run some numbers with that target, see if you raise more, you know, more angel money. What that means, if you can maybe bring some revenue on earlier than you thought and push

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:04.688Z)

like stage when you have this it's a flexion point.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:07.855Z)

for revenue and say, you know, this is already producing workflow. Like, we

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:10.698Z)

Necessary.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:11.715Z)

wanna see some sort of traction. But I think

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:13.208Z)

But but know, it's kind of like a

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:15.405Z)

maybe you play with that numbers, and and we can reconvene. And I can, you know,

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:15.918Z)

it's a day by day thing. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:19.835Z)

provide any other advice that that might be helpful. But, yeah, we would start engaging

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:21.088Z)

We just got a terrible email the night before, and we have a call the next day, we'd be like, two

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:24.595Z)

more heavily at that seed stage when there's some revenue tracking Half of the firm likes later stage when you hit this, like, inflection point.

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:33.648Z)

quick question. It's I know we have

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:36.085Z)

I don't think it's necessary

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:37.438Z)

is there anyone just looking at it

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:39.875Z)

But but, you know, it's kind of like a it's a day by day

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:44.258Z)

I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:44.315Z)

Yeah. You know? If we've gotten burned by something too early and we're we just gotta

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:45.638Z)

and I haven't seen that with that many.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:48.865Z)

a terrible email the night before and we have a call the next day, we'd be like,

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:50.888Z)

That for outside perspective,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:52.575Z)

too early. Right? It's like Right. It just

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:53.328Z)

they're all Right? Like, you're gonna want

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:55.125Z)

it's a day by day thing. We're constantly moving targets.

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:56.138Z)

a product that is high level low like, high level

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:42:58.145Z)

And then before I know you have to go, but just one last quick question is I know we have competitors out

### You (2025-07-24T18:42:59.238Z)

Okay. High level credit and

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:03.055Z)

there, but in your I'm don't and no names. But are is there anyone who's looking at it

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:03.628Z)

the banks more details on the other

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:07.425Z)

the same way we are, or are they looking at it from the asset management space?

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:07.448Z)

side of this Your product is gonna should touch

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:11.135Z)

I mean, I think that and I haven't seen

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:12.598Z)

those. Right? And so I think that

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:14.495Z)

dived in that deep with that many. I think that

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:15.508Z)

ultimately they're competition to you.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:18.415Z)

from the outside perspective, they're all one.

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:18.718Z)

Doesn't mean that only one can exist. Though.

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:21.115Z)

Right? Like, you're gonna wanna have a product that is high level low like, level and

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:21.568Z)

Right. If you guys can come up with creative

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:26.085Z)

Mhmm. High level might be

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:27.008Z)

creative data

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:28.405Z)

more of the credit and the bank side of things.

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:28.658Z)

ingestion That is something different. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-24T18:43:32.355Z)

More detailed on the other side of the spectrum are the third party operators. Right?

### You (2025-07-24T18:43:32.788Z)
