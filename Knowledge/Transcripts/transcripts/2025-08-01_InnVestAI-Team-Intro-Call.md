So in 2020, I got for my job during pandemic.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:07:26.433Z)

Technology companies to do them, and we've been doing.

### You (2025-08-01T16:07:44.513Z)

Part of how diane and I.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:07:44.993Z)

So that's kind of part of how Diane and I connected. So it's what my existing company, which is called Hotel Business Intelligence Solutions,

### You (2025-08-01T16:07:48.913Z)

Think is helpful to help this intelligence solution. What it does is very complimentary.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:07:54.113Z)

What it does is very complimentary. To what we're trying to do with InnVestAI. It's a proprietary data model.

### You (2025-08-01T16:08:01.073Z)

Analog.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:08:03.713Z)

And it aggregates data from a lot of different hospitality related sources.

### You (2025-08-01T16:08:04.593Z)

Y a lot of different established. It's self destruction.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:08:10.673Z)

It's all structured.

### You (2025-08-01T16:08:10.753Z)

Data.

It's a little bit different than the approach we're taking here. And we have.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:08:19.313Z)

And we have, I think, eight or nine customers right now. A couple hundred hotels in the US And Europe. And ultimately, I think I'm hoping that we can kind of merge these businesses.

### You (2025-08-01T16:08:28.753Z)

Emerged into our.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:08:32.353Z)

Technology service.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:08:40.273Z)

And how they fit together in hospitality. And applying, trying to apply everything I've learned to what we're doing here. So. Hence why sometimes I may. I feel like I may be repeating myself over and over again. And really make sure that I want to make sure everything is really clear. What dyad, Mark and I, who kind of have the hospitality, real estate background, and we're trying to translate what we know into the technology, how that looks from a technology perspective.

### You (2025-08-01T16:08:56.033Z)

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:09:38.833Z)

We spend a lot of time together, and it really is a dynamic team. And one of the best things about our group is that we all in the hotel or in the real estate world, but we all come from different areas of expertise and specialties, so we're really complementing each other very well.

### You (2025-08-01T16:09:45.393Z)

But we don't come from different areas of expertise and specialty, so we're really complimenting each other very well. And we're happy to have you now as part of our team. As well.

And to echo what some others have said, is the.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:01.633Z)

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:07.073Z)

Rapy.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:07.313Z)

We're just so impressed. With how quickly the MVP is moving. We've been working on this for about five months.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:08.673Z)

We've been working on this for about five months. And how just going through the process of taking a couple of Excel models.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:13.313Z)

And Howard has been. I mean, just going through the process.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:17.473Z)

And turning them over to Hired, who then creates them in a database.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:17.713Z)

Of taking a couple of Excel models and turning them over to Howard, who then creates them in a database and then turning it over to Vinod and you all so that it gets translated into software.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:22.113Z)

And then turning it over to an open. So that it gets translated into software. We've just all been really happy.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:31.553Z)

We've just all been really happy and to see how quickly the MVP is coming along from a software development perspective.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:36.593Z)

Perspective. It really gives us a lot. Of optimism.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:40.673Z)

It really gives us a lot of optimism, and our goal is to try to get something as concrete as possible.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:40.913Z)

And our goal is to try to get something as concrete as possible by Labor Day. Because on quite the world.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:47.713Z)

Labor day. Because on labor day.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:49.553Z)

Right. It's a slower season. Right now.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:51.153Z)

Like the world, right?

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:52.353Z)

As people wrap up vacations.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:52.433Z)

It's a slower season. Right now.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:53.873Z)

But come labor day,

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:54.593Z)

As people wrap up vacations. But come Labor Day.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:55.473Z)

Everything turns back on and so want to be ready.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:16:57.713Z)

Everything turns back on. And so we really want to be ready to give potential investors.

### You (2025-08-01T16:16:59.633Z)

To give potential investors and potential clients. A demo. That is a good demo with a software product.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:17:05.153Z)

And potential clients. A demo that is a good demo with a software product.

### You (2025-08-01T16:17:08.913Z)

So that's where we're going to all looking at layered potential point where we jump off and really start to saturate the market.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:17:11.553Z)

So that's. We're kind of all looking at Labor Day as the potential point where we jump off and really start to saturate the market.

### You (2025-08-01T16:17:28.433Z)

Thanks a lot, everyone, for information.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:17:30.913Z)

Thanks a lot, everyone, for the introduction. And kind of reach and sharing the reason for the product. Maybe I'll just add a couple of things and then. I'm sorry. I Drew. Drew, do you want to go first? Actually. I was just saying then thank you to Vinod for being our kind of art liaison or intermediary with Srival Dimraj as well.

### You (2025-08-01T16:17:57.393Z)

Difficult startup from very ground level, but just to share something about the hospitality industry.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:17:58.513Z)

And you're getting involved with a startup from the very ground level, but just to share some bit about the hospitality industry,

### You (2025-08-01T16:18:07.073Z)

We probably represent, I don't know, 7 or 8% of total real estate value globally, which some of that is saying launched, especially compared to multifamily. But where the opportunity lies is hospitality is a fairly spoke property type. Our data is different.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:18:08.353Z)

We probably represent, I don't know, 7 or 8% of total real estate value globally, which some will look at that and say, well, that's not that much. Especially compared to multifamily. But where the opportunity lies is hospitality is a very bespoke property type. Our data is different.

### You (2025-08-01T16:18:28.993Z)

It's much more complex.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:18:31.713Z)

It's much more complex.

### You (2025-08-01T16:18:31.953Z)

And so hospitality industry is behind the general real estate industry by a decade because there are platforms in existence.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:18:33.873Z)

And so the hospitality industry is behind the general commercial real estate industry by a decade because there are platforms in existence.

### You (2025-08-01T16:18:40.993Z)

That are automating. I won't like deal. Pipeline management. They're automated communication between the Consilia parties involved.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:18:43.153Z)

That are automating pipeline. Like the deal. Pipeline management. They're automating the communication between the gazillion parties involved. They're creating AVMs, especially in multifamily, but none of that.

### You (2025-08-01T16:18:51.713Z)

They're cramming, especially in multifamily. But it's happening. In hospitality. And it is taking people with hospitality experience.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:18:59.073Z)

Happening. In hospitality. And it is going to take. It is taking people with hospitality experience to partner with people like Vinod and Howard with technology and product development experience.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:02.993Z)

To partner with people like Bono and Power with technology and product development experience to bring this to bear.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:12.753Z)

To bring this to bear.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:13.553Z)

So our customer base will essentially be lenders.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:15.873Z)

So our customer base will essentially be lenders and probably. And I heard a stat recently from Greg Friedman, who's the head of a Peach.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:20.113Z)

Dad recently. In the us next year.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:27.073Z)

Tree group. He's a big lender. In the us in the us next year.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:28.993Z)

30% of hotel loans are going to come do. And so we believe that lenders are probably the early potential users.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:31.473Z)

30% of hotel loans are going to come due. And so we believe that lenders are probably one of the earliest potential users of our product.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:39.793Z)

Of our product because they underwrite at a pretty high level.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:42.993Z)

Because they underwrite at a pretty high level. So lenders, owners, brokers, appraisers.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:47.873Z)

Appraisers. Managers doing feasibility work, and then we're going to do a whole nother layer.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:19:51.633Z)

Managers doing feasibility work. And then you get into a whole nother layer, which is the loan servicing part of it.

### You (2025-08-01T16:19:55.473Z)

Servicing part of it. And last with Howard says all, which is automation.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:00.193Z)

And last with what Howard says all the time.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:03.233Z)

Is great.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:03.393Z)

Which is the workflow automation.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:03.953Z)

But what's really going to come out of this credit data products that we have.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:05.633Z)

Is great. But what's really going to come out of this?

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:07.633Z)

Because.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:07.953Z)

Are the data products that we have.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:10.353Z)

Investment data products that is forward looking and.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:10.593Z)

Because we will be the first investment data product that is forward looking and one, there are no products on the investment side.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:15.953Z)

The adjustment side. But even if you look at if the revenue side of our business, CoStar is a big player.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:19.233Z)

But even if you look at if the revenue side of our business, CoStar is a big player, but their data is all very static.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:22.833Z)

But data is all different Status. And historical. And so, in addition to the workflow automation.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:27.793Z)

And historical. And so, in addition to the workflow automation.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:29.473Z)

We have tremendous opportunity with the data and data aggregation and potential data products that we produce.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:31.873Z)

We have tremendous opportunity with the data and data aggregation and potential data products that we produce. And then one example of that, and then I'll close this up, is we live and die.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:38.513Z)

And then, as one example of that, and then I'll close this up. Is we live by global a few networks, but one of them that's very important is cap rate information.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:47.473Z)

By a lot? Well, a few metrics, but one of them that's very important is cap rate information.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:51.793Z)

Capri is essentially hotels, and that divided purchase price.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:20:53.793Z)

And cap rate is essentially a hotel's net operating income divided by the purchase price plus any major capex that has to be capitalized with the transaction.

### You (2025-08-01T16:20:57.553Z)

Plus any major capex that has to be capitalized with the transaction. And so right now, it's just a game of all around. What was the Cabriolet on this?

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:21:07.233Z)

Right now, it's just a game of call around. What was the cap rate on this?

### You (2025-08-01T16:21:10.273Z)

And you could be getting Apples to Origins to pairs, right?

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:21:11.153Z)

What was the cap rate on this? And there is no you could be getting. It's apples to oranges to pears, right?

### You (2025-08-01T16:21:15.553Z)

Because really, at the turn definition of what a cap rate is, it could be on Twitterly 12 and online it could be on 4 or 12.

Because no one really has a firm. Definition of what a cap rate is. It could be on trailing twelve noi. It could be on forward twelve. It could be on some sort of adjusted noi with capex. Without capex.

### You (2025-08-01T16:21:24.353Z)

It could be on some sort of adjusted noi with Capex. Without Capex. So our product, because it's an underwriting product. And we will have the historical information and the projections.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:21:32.113Z)

So our product, because it's an underwriting product, and we will have the historical information and the projections will be the first product with actual, actual, real noi that we can use, right?

### You (2025-08-01T16:21:37.233Z)

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:21:46.433Z)

So when you close a commercial real estate deal, you have to go through the attorney. Variable did the writing and all of these documents.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:21:52.193Z)

So when you close a commercial real estate deal, you have to go through, like, you know, attorneys are involved and they're writing all of these documents.

### You (2025-08-01T16:22:00.833Z)

Purchase and sale agreements and JV agreements and all of it.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:22:02.113Z)

And you're. And you're going through purchase and sale agreements and JV agreements.

### You (2025-08-01T16:22:04.113Z)

And then you get title and survey involved, and title closes the deal.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:22:05.633Z)

And all of this. And then you get title and survey involved, and title closes the deal, and the title company issues a closing statement, a HUD statement that actually has the purchase price on it.

### You (2025-08-01T16:22:10.113Z)

And the title company has used a closing statement, a HUD statement that actually has the purchase price on it. Thinking about how to build out a Capex module to this as well.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:22:21.953Z)

And then we were thinking about how we build out a Capex module.

### You (2025-08-01T16:22:24.273Z)

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:22:25.873Z)

### You (2025-08-01T16:22:47.153Z)

The workshop is great. But we're real. Money will be. Is it the data and how we think about data products?

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:22:49.713Z)

The workflow automation is great. But we're. The real money will be is in the data. And how we think about data and our data products.

### You (2025-08-01T16:23:00.113Z)

That's why anything it has so much possibility because it's not job work or centralized data. And that's more trouble about this as well.

### Guest (2025-08-01T16:23:01.313Z)

Just wanted to give you that background because that's why we think it has so much possibility, because it's not just workflow automation, but it's bringing centralized data. And Mark talks a lot about this as well.

### You (2025-08-01T16:23:10.913Z)
