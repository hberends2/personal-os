And then finalize with any small administrative things like logo, bank accounts, things like that, it might help the call. Very good idea. You do? Okay. Yeah, because. Sidetracked and not get to that. And it is definitely the most important, so we should start with it. You guys okay with that? Yeah, that's what get a better idea of. Where do we stand on the funding? Sales, Sales. Sales part every week with, you know, whether there's any progress on that front and few other items like website content generation. I don't know who is working on that. We spoke about that. In last few meetings.

### You (2025-10-07T21:38:46.424Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T21:39:07.703Z)

Yeah, I plan to work on that. I just have to get through the LLC first, so. But that's probably. Well, I don't know. That probably sits on all of our all. I mean, Howard, you'll have views on that. All of you on that. Drew will have you on at views on it, so. But. I would like to give Mark more of a floor to talk to help lead the investor development business development part of this. And have accountability both on the technical side and on the investor basis, if that makes sense. So everyone, thumbs up. Okay? And let me my one update on it. Carlos and I email today. He has the pitch deck. Thank you, Drew. I did tell him that the pitch deck wasn't 100% done, that we were still working on Hopla. Like, do we even include a Tam? You know, what do we want to put as the capital we need raise, right? And he said he understood all of that, and so it's just a matter of. He's traveling probably between. There was an AI conference in D.C. last week for the hospitality industry more focused on operators I think but he and his had had a asset management were there but it's still all. It's moving forward so that 75k is moving forward so I'm. I feel thankful. And blessed about that. Sounds interesting. So I think for now, right, that's the only lead we have. Then we should also plan how we, you know, plan to spend that, because that's the only money we have. Like, what are our priorities right now, whether. You've had about this, and then you have. That I'm missing. Perhaps that would. Because there's two things that have to happen, right? Is the technology side needs to give the business side comfort that we're making progress, and then the business side needs to help the technology side feel comfortable that we're out hustling enough. That's what I feel and like, as a the quarterback of this process, that these are the two things that need to happen to keep the five of us in sync and inspired. But, Drew, you've had more conversations with Mark than I have, so do you have anything to add or that would modify what I'm saying? Yeah. So I think that's, you know, we have the budget now, which is, I think, more or less, Like, accurate or, you know, reflects. Our most recent discussions for the, you know, the rest of the year and most of next year. I'll. Just share this. It's going to be small. But. Could you please. Where was that coming from? That's like 75 we are getting from this company. And then 15 we said we had. In previously. Oh, yeah. This up here at the top. Yeah. Okay, that's. Yeah. So this is basically money in. Yeah. You know, fundraising revenue. And then expenses. By month. Total costs. And then this is cumulative, cumulative costs. And then this just calculates, you know, how much. Are we spending versus how much? Like, you know, what's our. What do we need? So are we going to stick to this sheet for all our expenses? Are we going to change this? I mean, reality, Drew, right? It comes down to what we are able to raise. Right? Like, no, this is always going to be part of. This is always something we should discuss because it's the reality of. You know what we're doing? And what we need in order to get everything. As far as, like, tracking the actual expenses. Once we get to bank account, set up every go to the bank account track that way. Right, so that. 'll be where we look at the actual spend. And track all of that. I think this like, I'll keep them in sync, more or less. But this is where we should be looking at. Again, like our needs. So in this case, This seems, though we just. Right, like. Then there's our expenses here. Right. So these come to. Right. Okay. Cumulatively, right, the year we're expecting to spend 97,000, which is a little bit more than we've raised. That means that we. If we spend as per this year, then we kind of run out of balance in December. Right? Right. So. Yeah. And benoit, I can't. Your starting date salary got pushed to January. I don't know if that was. I must have been me. But I don't know if that was agreed to by you or not. But your guys salaries obviously. You know, subject to discussion. Not discussion. But like I know you all are eager to get. Are getting paid. So, you know, and then we. Diane, your point was to prioritize all of that. That's super important to me, to prioritize, like, because I see the bottom up piece of it. But I also feel like it's a matter of when we get another 50k, when we get another 100k, what's the priority of that raise? Right, and the priority needs to be paying Howard some money to survive and getting the node on board full time. Right? Right. And then there we start to work on if we need people dedicated to AI and really build, because once we get a pilot, we're going. To need someone on board. Again. It's not the salaries part. To be adjusted. But that gives us money to. Last the rest of the year. But Mark and I have been talking about this a lot. I mean, all of us have been talking and thinking about this a lot. We will absolutely be going to different groups to get more money. Before the end of the year. You know, starting. Yeah. The question is, when do we really start that? And there needs to be. We want to have something compelling and to present to potential customers and the trade off. What Mark has been talking about, and I think it's a great idea, is doing like some amount of, you know, some number of months of free service. In exchange for a hundred thousand dollar safe note. Right. And I think that if we do that like three times, something like that, that gives us a good chunk of money to take us through the rest of the quarter. We have Q1. How does that free service work? Like someone works for them. Or. We give them free access to our tool. Well, that's. We would give them. They would be getting. Imagine here like this. Let's hype. Like hypothetically, say it's Peachtree on the debt side. We would sit down with their team and what we want to try to do is find at least one client. Per Persona, if that makes sense. So a debt and structured finance company. Although there may be the group we find the most interest from. Right. An owner, an appraiser. What am I missing? An operator. Right. So we have these six Personas. And work with that client. So if it's Peachtree and they're a lender, right, we are saying, okay, we've got the data extraction and the formulas built, but what do you actually need as a letter to build a product that makes sense for you? Right. So it may be that they're giving us X amount in revenue and X amount in a safe note, or all on a safe note. All on revenue. But we're spending our time trying to work with each Persona over the next six to nine months to say, okay, lender Persona. Now we've built the avm, right? That kind of focuses on when you're a lender, you're focused more on risk. Right? Like, what's the risk that my. The person I'm lending to can't pay me back? When you're an equity person. And this has peach. This is more along the lines of driftwood. You're more focused on the equity side. Right. Which is. All right. I have complicated full service hotel. And so what Driftwood hopefully will provide to us is guidance on how to build out a more complicated full service model. When we find an appraiser, hopefully that's lesser in wise, they'll help us focus on the appraisal work. Does that make, does that make sense? So we're spending. Basically, we are designing our product so that these different Persona can use as per their requirement. Right. So a product will be driven from their requirements. Would that not change our product roadmap? Howard and I believe Howard should be included. Yeah, absolutely. Our is key to it. Right. Real quick. Just the note to be clear. Because just to correct something Diane said, we're not. I mean, when we say take customer feedback, we're not gonna. This is not. A customer driven, right? Like this is still a product driven. Like product, right? So we are. Going to take. Like, remember, this is our stakeholders. We've talked about different types of companies, brokers. It's still the same. The exact same product. Just as it applies. Slightly differently or is used slightly differently by different user groups. So the Personas that it's talking about is kind of each of these. So I don't think we'll get one from each of these right off the bat. We'll probably start with, you know, a lender, maybe an appraiser. Right. So we'll start one at a time. And do it as quickly as we can. Take their feedback and get them onboarded. And also impress them that they want to continue. Which a little bit is most important for us at this point of time. Probably. Well, the Lender Group probably has the most opportunity. But with Driftwood involved, as an owner and a management company, they are very technologically savvy. And they've also, just for feedback, they invested in Revere along with three other very. I don't know how to say this, but exclusive investors, right? So they know technology, and so I think they'll be able to help us on the technology side. But we feel the single biggest pairing for us initially is the lender and appraiser side, because there will not be as many transactions happen next year, but there will be a lot of refinancings happen. Next year. And with every financing, it triggers an appraisal. So these two almost go coupled together. Right. And so if we can find a Persona of each of these, and that Persona helps us build out the product for the broader. Investor Persona, if I'm saying that. Right, right. So that if we work with Peachtree, we're then able to monetize to a hundred other 200 other lenders. Right. Because we've gotten their feedback and appraisers. So it's. It's Benoit, when we say lender. We mean, like, they are a type of company that underwrites at a high level. So the requirements they have for the AVM portion of what we're doing. Is, you know, that's why this is kind of on the product roadmap first. The lender model. But it's the same model. It's not like we're changing the model. Same model. Yeah. Yeah. When we say lender model, it's. It's meant to be like, who are we marketing this to? Okay, cool. So the MVP we are developing, I believe suits Lender most right now.

### You (2025-10-07T21:54:07.064Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-10-07T21:54:07.703Z)

Yeah. And then as we add to this, it'll be a more ad components to the AVM that make it more attractive or, you know, more usable by a different user groups. And I think, Diane, you brought this up a few other times as well. I wanted to understand about Driftwood. How are they involved in the ownership? And also you said they'll help us. Technically, how are they going to help? So driftwood. Family office business. It is Carlos Rodriguez Senior and Carlos Rodriguez Junior. And it's the Junior. And I want to really express this because I think this is a strategy for us across many different Personas. 40. And is next to rise up when that person that's in the 60 to 65 range. Retirement, but their technologically motivated. And so in the case of Driftwood, It's Carlos Rodriguez Jr. Who's very technologically motivated. They have a platform that is an investor, it's also an operator. And they may be expanding into credit. I don't know. But Carlos Trudeau Jr. Has an incredibly clear idea of how he envisions the future of real estate and technology. Real quick. I want to just jump in. When she says that she means that that company. Has multiple Personas. They are amazing. So they do a lot of things. So they can provide. They have different teams that do these different things, obviously, but they can provide. Carlos Jr. Right. Like, it's going to be more knowledgeable than most about all of these different Personas and can wearables. And they already have technology developed for these Personas. They do. They have an in house group and it's all Dom platform called Domino. And their chief technology officer, Howard. Do you remember we met with Mani? I don't know if you remember this. So Mani is a very experienced uto. He comes from the crypto space. I think you will love him when you start to work with him. But he's tasked with a very big. Well, I think Ricardo Jr envisions is if he can kind of figure this. Out for his own company, how does he then go to the industry and monetize it? Because he's using Dealpath, he's using Juniper Square, he's using all these tools, right? And he's finding what works and doesn't work for the hospitality space. So I think that they could be. They could. How do I describe this? There's 75k at first. They could come along with us every quarter for, like, another chunk of investment. They could be a very helpful advisor to us. They could be a very helpful Persona tester for us. Right. So we're kind of like, it's kind of. Like when. And I know you guys get very tired of me talking about Elise AI because they were just a chat box. Company when they started 10 years ago. But when they got to their mvp, they were working with real customers, right, to develop their mvp. And so I see Carlos kind of as one of the most technological. 40 to 55 year olds base who will be taking on leadership up their company and have impact in the industry to help us develop our product and be behind us. And we would really like their team to, I think, well, we may find solutions, they might help us find solutions to things that are further on our roadmap. And we will help them find solutions to things that they haven't figured out yet. So does that. Does that, Drew, how did I explain? Or Howard, how did I explain that? All right. See, they already have this technology that we are also developing, that in a way, there are competitors. So how are they going to help or why are they going to help us? Because they're only doing it right now for their company. And they see a way to do it for the entire industry. Right. Carlos Jr. Says, if I'm doing all this money internally, how do I monetize it for the entire industry? Right, but they have their own technology developed. So I'm not getting any point.

### You (2025-10-07T21:58:53.544Z)

Well, yes and no. They don't have an avm.

### Guest (2025-10-07T21:58:55.463Z)

Why would.

### You (2025-10-07T21:58:56.904Z)

Which is really kind of what we're focusing on. First. So it's more of a partnership. I think is the way I view it. Then. Potential buyer. It's a potential partner. I mean, there's a lot of advantages to going with them. But I understand you're concerned, Vinod, that if they have the talent, the capital and resources, That maybe what's going to stop them from turning around and building an abm. So yeah, I think we need to make sure there's some type of a non compete.

### Guest (2025-10-07T21:59:33.223Z)

N't. Their resources are stretched very thin internally when it comes to technology, even still. And so Carlos is probably feeling like his technology platform is in advance, as he like it too, because they're doing tons of things like growing their luxury platform and doing things like that. So I think the big I can say is they're an investor in. They were one of the earliest investors in Revere and revered his Sold to Light box.

### You (2025-10-07T21:59:35.944Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:00:07.383Z)

So their involvement helped the ultimate recapitalization of Revere with Lightbox, if that makes sense. Ultimately, like, we don't know. Who your question is? We don't know. Yeah, that's why I'm in my mind. That already don't have. If you know, we know what we need. You know, we can. Technologically, we can develop anything. We just need to save more on the investment metric side. So once an asset is acquired, they've developed more than we have. More along the lines of, like, a pair of you, right, where they're pulling up the operating and AI and the capital stack and calculating the NOI returns and leveraged returns and the IRRs and things like that. But they have not done as well is work on the avm. And so for us, our roadmap, and it's not in the 18 month roadmap, but involves both. Right. We're starting with the ABM, but we want to get to the point where we're also working on like we're being the midpoint where the midman and we're pulling. Once we've worked on the acquisition, it's so easy for us just to pull up all the other information and then expand our platform into the investment management space. They able to help us accelerate our investment management strategy and we can help accelerate their AVM and their investment in us helps us accelerate our growth. Along with other investors that will bring to the table. Then there'll be a user. I think they'll be one of the first groups to start using it. Right. When the time is right, we will have a couple of their users sign on to start testing components. And how much ownership are we giving to them for the 75? That they are giving. It's a five million dollar pre money valuation. And so. No, Diane, do not ever say that. It's not a valuation. Ok. It is a safe note. It has no valuation. In exchange. For $75,000 worth of. Stock when we get evaluation. I'd never say it's $5 million. Just there's no valuation. Safe note. The note. I can send you the videos that explain safe notes and how they work. But the closest thing it has to evaluation is that it has a valuation cap. Which basically, like, if we were to sell the company tomorrow for $50 million, Driftwood would get. $75,000 worth of stock as though it were worth $5 million. They get really. But that's not going to happen. So this is basically like a $75,000 in exchange for at a future date when we do evaluation around. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. That's the way we're going to do all of these. Initial investments because they don't require evaluation. They'll all be safe notes. That are just obviously, the fewer we do, the less we do, the better. But they're the best way to raise money without having to put a valuation on anything. Sorry. I didn't mean to jump on you. That's good. I appreciate it. What partnership is. Yeah, I'm in. My consent is. I think you are clear about Drift involvement. I'm very far from there. I'm not very clear why, apart from the industry. We include when we already have expertise from the product side, from the business side. You guys have been. Yeah, there may be a couple. We should think of them as a customer. That's the way. Our first customer beta tester. The fact that they have this additional technology expertise. It's unclear how that's going to be relevant. At this point. Right? I mean, they have technology expertise, we understand, but how is that going to be useful to us or to our product is what we have to figure out. Yeah. Agree. What don't we know what don't technically or product wise that they'll bring in? Yeah, agreed. We'll figure that out. As soon as they signed a note. I think the next step will be to get all of us introduced to a couple of key members there. And start to have those discussions. As many people as we can, but it would be beneficial for us if. Your crystal clear. Like you know why they are involved.

### You (2025-10-07T22:05:27.784Z)

Vinod One of the things that.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:05:31.063Z)

Yeah, go ahead.

### You (2025-10-07T22:05:31.384Z)

I was going to say one of the things that we might want to view. From a technological side is. Potential integration with the things that they're developing. Right. So we still focus on the avm. And the related data that we get from that. But some of their products might help accelerate going into the asset management. Because from what I heard, Drew mention it sounds like they do have multiple product. Or, I'm sorry, maybe it was Diane that mentioned it, but they do have multiple products. Or technical or things that they're working on right now. That maybe there's a potential that we can expand quicker or get some more integration, greater level of data. But, yeah, we do. I think we do need to define that.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:06:22.263Z)

Yeah. And Benoit. It might be less on the technology side, if this makes sense. I mean, it's on the technology side, but it's like they're tackling. Business processes. Tackled yet. Does that make sense? And so you and your team are doing a fantastic job on the technology side. They're probably underperforming. What was the goal for them on the technology side? Because they're a very busy company, but it's the business processes that they're more advanced on something that were more advanced on others. Does that make sense? And so Drew and I and Howard. I'm not. We've never even really sat down and talked about. What an ass. True asset management product. Would look like as far as calculating. Like, this is like the yardy thing that you're working on. Does this make sense where you're integrating with Yardi and pulling the arti information in and things like that? Does that make sense? From technologically technological side. Let me make it clear. What? All we need is. We need some funding. We need to hire some good people. I need to come on board. Okay? Once I am there. Once we have good team. Once we have good, you know, people on board. I don't, you know, necessarily need any technical help from anyone. We can figure out, as far as we are clear, what we are building and why we are building, who we are having. Developing anything technologically is not very challenging. Only part is we don't have enough funding. We don't have. You know that that's what we should focus on. And Carlos could help us make introductions. He could be on our advisory board. Right. He is the future of the hotel investment space when it comes to technology. So he's not a technology. Person. He's a business person, like I am. Marc is, but he believes in technology, and he's one of the few leaders right now that we do. So this has more application on the business side than it does on the technology side, when it's all said and done. But it's the gravitas that a driftwood brings to us when we say Driftwood is potentially one of our anchor investors. Right. To other people that signals seriousness, right. That a group like Driftwood is serious about us enough that they would invest money in us. And so it lends that gravitas, and it lends. I truly believe that you guys will find Carlos Jr. Really an amazing inspiration. And he has yet to set foot in his dad's shoes completely. But when the company transitions over to him, he has a lot of ideas on how he wants to deploy technology. Right now, we just need to think of him as our first investor. They're a customer. So once we are ready to start having external users start testing, then they'll be one of the first we go to. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, right now I've hired very less experienced people. I'm trying to mentor them, guide them on day to day basis. And you know, I do have limited time available and you know, I work as a mentor to them and I work as an individual contributor. I go for myself and you know, I yeah. Try to help these guys. Complete the work faster. But as soon as we have some funding and available, I would really like to hire some more experienced, full time, dedicated engineers who could, you know, kind of expedite this engineering work. To that end, let's just. Let's kind of try to steer back to where I think where we were and where we want. To go for the next 20 minutes. We have, like, working on the. There's the AVM component, right? The pro forma influx outputs. There's the document survey thing. And there's AI Deal summary components, right? So when we. Have, I think the document scraping and the AVM inputs and outputs, when those features are to the point where we can have. When those components are where we can have an external user or when I can test them and they all work pretty well or well enough. We can have potentially one of Mark's analysts or someone from Drift would come and start being the first external tester. I guess the question is right. Is that going to be at the end of October, in November? Then when some of those, you know, when some of those external users have tested these components and. They are working and they, you know, we get good feedback, then we can take them to our next. You know, the next two or three external groups and say, like, look, we have this working. Be our next in exchange for a hundred thousand dollar safe, right? Like come and get three months free. In exchange for being our next customer, you know, beta tester. We add, you know, we add three or four of those. That'll get us through till, you know, a good way through next year. So to the question about, right? Like timing the node, getting you on board. Hiring additional resources. Right. Right now. I guess. We have. Assume, you know, when assuming this goes, you know, with Carlos goes through, we'll have 90,000. And, you know, so we'll have, like, two months. I mean, how? Like where we want to spend the money, I guess. The prioritization, right? Yeah. My priority would be to pay the founders at least some amount. We do need Howard or Diane to pay. They're not, you know, actively working, so my priority to keep them on board. I strongly believe that nobody is gonna be as dedicated or as motivated to work on this product as the core founder team. So I think we have to have the core founding team. Onboarded. I do not believe that even if we hired the best talent, they as motivated as we are. Yeah. Agreed. Yep, totally. Time has to be in, like, first, either full time or part time, but we need to pay them something so that, you know, they can spend more time and they're more motivated. Thank you, Vanilla. Yeah. Because I have a family. Discard. But I do want to say that we're going to run. I just truly feel we're going to run up against this roadblock over the next 30 to 60 days where markets get to come back from Phoenix and say we need a product that we can demo, and yet we really won't have a full. I mean, maybe I'm wrong and this is what we need to think about, but how in the next 30 days do we come up with a product that Mark can demo to all the people he's talking to? Right? And maybe it's only three to five people to us. Right. But Mark will not rate go try to raise money. Unless he feels like he has a product that can be demoed. I think he should go there and try using the product. I had already shared the detail how he should use it and then, you know, give me the feedback whether he thinks it is, demoable or not. Drew, you've been testing. What is your feedback? Well, let's. So just to back up the Phoenix. These conferences, they're not. This is like. A socializing, boozing for three days, right? He's gonna be playing golf. He's not gonna be demoing anything actively. Like at the conference or probably even this week. He's gonna follow up. Schedule meetings. Great with a handful of individuals, like probably next week. And you know we'll have two to three weeks, right, to do all this. So we'll have a few weeks. Right. Like before, we're actually. It's just to be clear on that. But, Diane, to your point, like, we do want to keep momentum going. Having these conversations, doing these introductory calls. We want to keep them undergoing. From the technology side, we are kind of making progress on daily basis or every week basis. Now we are able to process all sorts documents even with multi year. Right. We are just processing one year. Now you can process multi year as well. So we just. Great. And I did. I tested out. When new. Hei. It looks like the metrics are all coming in. So I could test out a few more. I guess from my own understanding. What is displayed here is not. I mean, there's one step in between what is loaded and how it fits into the data model versus how it's displayed here, right? I don't think I follow it. Well, like, what I was going to say is there's a line. I would say from a feedback perspective, there's a line missing here. There should be a miscellaneous income line here. But I think the values from the report that I loaded were captured. Because the total revenue is correct. And the room's revenue is correct. And the other revenue is correct. The miscellaneous revenue is not showing up. I guess what I'm getting at is I want to give you feedback, but I want to be back to give you or what? To give you feedback on. I don't want to go give you feedback on things that aren't ready yet, like format or the interface. What's displayed here. We had a meeting. Entire tech team and Howard met today, so, yeah, we have some feedback on the interface, for sure. And then we are still working on the forecasting part. Right. I think that logic and everything is updated now. Howard kind of put together all the formulas I think we finalized yesterday. We'll just revisit that. You mean the input, like the projections input part? Yeah, yeah. And then we are going to make it a single page scroller so that it is easier for the user to use rather than, you know, clicking on the tabs. So those changes will. Yeah. Will be made soon. Right. Cool. Yeah, I think that's the part that, again, like, the document processing in conjunction with populating the historicals and doing the projections is. What I should say that those three things and then the last part is going to be the pipeline management. This piece here, which, I mean, this seems like. It. And this is great. I think it's like, Diane, if I think about Steve Argyll trying to manage his, you know, 50 DLT's really through at any given point in time, and he has to go check some Excel file that's saved and nobody updates. Right. Like, this is a huge. This, you know, the other components of the document processing and the pro forma and whatnot. So I think when all these components are working, Then. And, you know, I tested them. LARX tested them. I assessed them. And you guys feel comfortable that, you know, then we'll go to the driftwood to start having somebody enter into a testament. You know, and I don't know when that'll be, but hopefully in the next. 30, 40, 50, 60 days, right? Yeah, I'm in. And if someone wants to demo this, I don't think it is a bad product or demo. You could still demo it. Like, you know, you can create a deal, show the pipeline, show the deal detail page. So the performer, so the valuation. So the investment summary is going to come up soon, so. The summary. Demo from the progress perspective. It's not 100% usable by the external client, but it can be demoed for sure. There's a lot of work done. Yeah. Right. This is all very, absolutely, like, presentation worthy. Demo. Demoable. And I'm guessing that or I'm pretty sure that anybody that sees this that the next question they're going to ask is sweet, like, when can I start using it? Right. So we want to make sure that the gap between showing them something and enabling them to sign up and start using it. Isn't huge. For understanding that they could start using it in three months if we had X amount finalized, like what Benoit's team is doing. See what we need to present to Peachtree. But we're as a team, we're going to come up against this roadblock where Mark will say it needs to be demolished. It might be demo up bull, but we're not in alignment on what that means. I truly feel like that's where we're going to face in the next 60 days. I think there's going to be a lot of. We're going to be splitting here. Yes. Splitting hairs and kind of ping ponging. Back and forth. As to how to proceed. But, yes, it'll come down. Like we're going to show this to probably Peachtree and Access Point Financial. And they're hopefully going to say, this is great. Now let me start using it and we can say, ok, we're looking for three or four additional seed investors. Whatever it is. Probably like $100,000 in exchange for being a beta user and some number months of free service. Getting them, you know, then we sign them up, they start using it. And we continue to do that. You know, we do that a couple of times. So we have, you know, how much money we need to get through. Right to the point where we think we have something that's going to generate revenue. I think it's going to be. It's going to be like, we're talking about like a six month, three, four, five, six months, right? Like, it's all going to happen really fast. I feel like. I would encourage you to demo this to Mark and, you know, let him decide. Is. See what he says. You. You have more meetings with him than I or we have. And I can demo. I really think we need to be careful around this because we could all reach an exasperation point pretty quickly because I think we're going to have a disagreement around what demo. So I just want to say the quarterback, right? People and interpersonals, Like, I think we just need to be really careful because there could be frustrations on either side because we're not in sync about what that like, Mark will want demo a bowl to mean that it's all syncing and the formulas are working. I will think demo a bull means that we're 75% of the way there and we need to prove to someone. We need funding to get to 100% of the way there. Beno do you mean having different view of that? Right? I would like to hear that from Mark. What Demo from his perspective. Portion should be done, then I can demo this portion should be completed. Then let him come from Let that come from his. Yeah, I mean, I think he's going to say it should be. To the point where somebody can sign in and, like, we could give Driftwood user access and somebody could sign in and start using it. Which is obviously like the far extreme of. What we're talking about here. Yeah, I think then I think we should expect. Expecting Mark to kind of reach out to people and get some funding or get some sales. Then we should put that on hold for now. Probably let him, you know, wait for three more months. In the meantime, we should be, you know, continue with other resources that we can reach out. To, right? It's not just the. Let me ask this. If we were to show this to somebody today, And they said, This is great. I want to start using it. Knowing that it's not perfect. How long would it be before we sign them up and they would have something. And I guess the question is, you know, what is it that works? You know? Like. But before they could as a user, Go in and drop in a bunch of P and Ls that the system can process with, let's say, 95% accuracy. And that they can use the, you know, input output features in the avm. And right here, like the stuff that's in the poc. And third, they can use the. Management. Verify. I cannot commit you the time. You know, time can differ as per my availability. You know, I was by now. But yeah, between kind of personal issues, I couldn't give it time at all. Very far from. You know, completing the mvp. What you are talking about draw is all the functionality of mvps, right? Yeah, we have mp. Yeah, I don't there. That's what I probably one month max. Okay, so I think that that sounds good. That's what I was hoping. And I think that Mark will agree with that, because that aligns fairly well with. Weak. Mark's going to come back and send all of emails. And the week after that, we'll schedule some presentation demos. Right. And then the week or two after that. Hopefully, at most, we'll start to sign up a couple of, you know, couple of users. You know, maybe starting with driftwood. And then maybe Access Point Financial or Peachtree or whoever it is. Right. I think, again, Mark's concerned, which I agree with, is that you don't want to spend. We don't want it to be, like, three months. Between when we start to get somebody excited about it and when we actually let them start using it, you want to keep the momentum. And then, of course, the flip side is you don't want to something that is, you know, doesn't work to their expectations. It's not like the fine line. It's all going to be very. Consonant is also that we are very dependent on Mark for fundraising, for sales, for marketing, and he's not available most of the times, so I think we are just imagining that he'll do all this. He's available because, again, the technology team needs to be accountable to everyone in the business side. The investor relations and the business development side needs to be accountable to everyone. So, I mean, I don't know how we get there, but we start by rearranging these calls so that each side has a time to talk. And there's more accountability. I mean, Benoit, your team is very accountable, but there's more. There's more accountability on each side of it. Andrew, am I wrong on that? I think what you? Yeah. Having vinod. How are you? Guys. Present, discuss everything that you're working on and, you know, kind of where we are. How close are we to what we just talked about? Right? Like, having those three components working and ready for somebody to start using and Mark. And similarly, like, when he comes back. Later this week or next week, he'll update us on who we spoke with, what the feedback was, what's the plan for, you know, sending follow up emails and scheduling introductory demos?

### You (2025-10-07T22:27:50.504Z)

So I.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:27:52.903Z)

Yeah. I mean.

### You (2025-10-07T22:27:54.104Z)

Was going to say.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:27:54.423Z)

Yeah, go ahead. Howard, you've been silent. Yeah. How have you been so silent? Is everything all right?

### You (2025-10-07T22:27:58.664Z)

Everything's fine. I'm just kind of taking all of this in. Let me just kind of point out some facts that we need to. Understand. I understand the. Desire to be able to meet with somebody to give a demo and then get them on board using it. As quick as we can. But. That's not the purpose of client demos and client feedback. So client feedback is the core of my job. Right. So I'm listening to everything that's being said, not trying to jump in. But when we have these demos, I'm going to be sitting in on them. It's not up to Mark to demo. When we have the finished product. Yes. As a sales team or whoever wants to go out and demo. That's. That's great. But while this is under development, This is. This is my job. And Drew, to your point about the momentum, this is actually a way to improve momentum. So think of this. Let's go back to February when I gave the analogy of to build a luxury car, you start off with skateboard, then you keep accelerating. So you want to show them the cool skateboard that you've got. And then a week or two later, show. Hey, look, we've got a motor now that we've added to this. And they're going to say, that's really cool, but that motor would be better on the back than it is on the front. And so they start to get ownership. Of the development. Not only are they just, you know, watching us do a demo, nodding their head and, you know, thumbs up, thumbs down. You want them to buy in and see. So the next time you go and show them that now you've got four wheels instead of two. And by the way, we move that motor to the back based on your suggestions, right?

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:30:05.943Z)

Here's the reminder.

### You (2025-10-07T22:30:08.984Z)

So we don't just do a demo. And then not talk to them until it's done. It's going to be a repeatable process. Meet with them, you know, weekly, bi weekly. And this kind of goes into what we've talked about in the past as well, about a client advisory board. So when we get these people on board, whether it's Driftwood, Peachtree or just somebody else that we know that wants to be involved. They would be meeting on a regular basis, maybe even more than one at a time. Right. We could. We could get three or four of them on the phone at once, but I just. I just want to make sure.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:30:46.343Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-07T22:30:48.584Z)

That we differentiate between where we are now, where we desperately need client feedback now. So the demo that the node is talking about is, let's show them the data ingestion, show how we can upload the data, and the data is shown on the screen here. Let's show them the pipeline. Let's show them the things that are done. And then when we piece them together.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:31:17.143Z)

Power.

### You (2025-10-07T22:31:17.544Z)

Then we have additional demonstrations. Say, ok, look. Now we can create a deal, upload the data, do this. From A to Z. But you got to have that intermediate process.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:31:28.423Z)

Ful.

### You (2025-10-07T22:31:29.704Z)

Otherwise, we're just. We could be going in a totally wrong direction.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:31:32.423Z)

Yeah. I hear you. I guess. I would say that Mark, Diane and I should be right. Like, we are the first level. And I don't think we. Have the three of us have given much feedback or done much testing yet. So I want to make sure there is enough some amount of that. I think I'm the only one that's gone in and tested the document. Right. Processing.

### You (2025-10-07T22:31:53.784Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:32:02.023Z)

So I should do that. For a week to Diane and Mark should both do it right? It should be not exhaust, but we need to better take advantage of that. Point of feedback, I think before.

### You (2025-10-07T22:32:13.464Z)

Yep. Agreed.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:32:15.703Z)

We? You know, I agree with what you're saying, and I think that's a valid point. I also think that it needs to be right. Like it's coupled up with we need to provide, we need. It. Have a chance to do our own internal review and feedback before.

### You (2025-10-07T22:32:28.264Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I was just assuming that that was already done. Then we start talking to clients. But, yes, no, you're absolutely right. We have to do that first.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:32:31.063Z)

We start. Yeah. Yes, but, yeah, I think we are. The next four, six, eight weeks are going to be. Yeah, we're going to, we're going to talk a lot about we should focus on, you know, looking at the product and talking about, you know, Mark, Diane and I should be getting feedback and testing things, and we should be pushing, you know, to. Get to the point where we all feel comfortable. Doing and then getting some customers just to, you know, actually set up and using it. An investment, or I think we say investment because that's probably easier for somebody to some event. Paying, you know, the same amount of money as far as committed annual contract and revenue. But that's, you know. That we're talking, too. They're not just random people, right? They're people that can actually have a way to help move this change forward in the industry. I mean, that's what we're trying to do, is find the people who, like Peachtree is when we're talking to them, they're one of the biggest lenders out there, and their CEO has a big voice on. Right. And he could really be an advocate for what we're doing. So they're not just random customers. They're leaders that we're looking for to say,

### You (2025-10-07T22:34:01.384Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:34:05.943Z)

Join us in this revolution, right, and help us push this forward. That's amazing. That's great. When are we reaching out to them? Be. Well, when are we gonna go? Yeah, to Mark. When he comes back. If you talk to Brian Waldman. And then the three, Drew and I and Mark kept it. If you didn't talk to Brian Waldman, who's their chief investment? How are we gonna talk to him? I think we just very step by step, Right. If we were to go to set up a call and we were Ryan or Greg from Peachtree Bay. I think they would say awesome. I'm just hypothesizing, but it was great. Right. And if we say. A month, two months, then. I guess. Back up, Howard, to your point. I guess we need to maybe think more about. If we were to present to Peachtree today. Maybe there's a level of engagement we can have with them before they are actually using it. There's a level of engagement where we are showing them. Hey, look. Here's last week, you know, here's what we showed you, and we changed this. We've modified this user interface, this feature, whatever. It's on your input, right? Yeah, I think that's a very valid point. I think Mark and I. Have been thinking of this as, you know, all or nothing, but there's. There's a good in between. And this is Drew. Please excuse me when I say this is where Brian told me. And I realized Brian is not Greg. And their interpersonal relationship do not reflect that Brian has the ability to commit to this. But Brian said, what would it cost you to get to a finalized mvp? And I said, I've made an Umper up at launch. I said 170k, and he said, 170k is nothing to us. He's like, right, I would need to present this to my credit group. But if it could be that we have the initial feedback and what the product looks like, what is Howard saying? Right? And that feedback represents all lenders. It's just the initial user. Right. Then they might be willing to say 100k, save note, 70k revenue. I don't know what it is. Right. But something that then for the next three months, we are building out the product based on lender specifications a little tiny bit different than. What an appraiser or an owner would look like, but still the core product, then that's how we start to fund it. As we start to get three of those people on board. And that is 500k. And that helps us get the note on board Howard paid. And then we get another will always be in fundraising mode perpetually for the life of this product. Well, every time we go to fundraising mode, it'll be a prioritization of the funds. What's next in the priority of how we need to spend money? Yeah. And I think, yeah, we should seriously think about keeping the founders full time. Because we cannot do much being ours. And the issue and I mean, I think Mark will say that because he said it as bluntly to me as it could be said, is he does not want to pay salaries because of dilution. And so maybe that was an anger moment for him. And I'm saying this is recorded. This can literally go back to him. But he's very focused right now on our dilution, which has factors back into the safe notes. Right. Because of what that drew. How do you want to call it? Future valuation plays into it. Can I just caveat maybe a little bit? Sure. I think it is right. The more money we raise, the more diluted we get. That's cool. But, yeah, we do need to survive, though. But that's not to say that we don't need. To do like Mark and I are not going to work full time on this. I can't. Right? Money needs to be spent. Money needs to be raised and spent in order to develop the product. That's obviously, like, you know, that's the way this works. The reason we have this budget. And we try to, you know, try to be very. I guess tight about what we are raising and spending is because. Yeah. The more we raise, the more we get diluted. So I don't think Mark is necessarily I wouldn't say he's against. Paying salaries, doesn't want us to get wants to minimize dilution. So those are two sides of the same coin, obviously. Right. Like getting understanding that you guys are going to work full time. You guys are going to grow the product and get as closer. To customers, etc. Right. Like to that extent, obviously. You need. Like, we need to spend money, and you guys are part of what we're gonna. What we're spending money on. I feel like. Those are. Yeah. Does that make sense? Like how big markets against. I mean, obviously, if we could do this whole thing for free and not raise any money, we would. But obviously we can't. So that's where it comes in to say that we only want to raise as much money as we absolutely need to. Yeah. And then, you know, we do not want to lose our founding members because, you know, we, we are not, we have found, but we are not paying them. We are paying other, other folks outside. Yeah, no, I, I, I do that. And that's why I think just to go back to the budget, right? Like. We can. I put. You know the note. I moved you back up so that there's pay here for you. And right, like, starting next month, I mean, we got to get the LLC agreement finalized, we got to get a bank account open and get to 75,000 and the 15,000 deposited, and then we can go to write, like, our next group, I think. Whoever it is. Back from this conference, and we're going to. You know, get initial feedback from a couple. Other. Right, then we'll have you know. 375, almost 400,000. To give us a Runway. So again, we will always be raising money. We will just all wait, because you have to. You have to do it in advance. So we'll be in it, right? Yeah. Finding customers, if you can. Test. Yeah, when we start raising. Eventually the fundraising, you know, will slow down. I mean, maybe tons of different ways to do it. Somebody to discuss. At a later date. I had to go. I have to pick up one of my kids.

### You (2025-10-07T22:41:22.984Z)

Yeah, I need to drop as well.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:41:23.303Z)

But thanks for saying so. The next maybe starting next Tuesday with Marcus back. Technology first. Drew, you're the leader of these calls. Technology first, business investor. Give Mark the floor for and let him talk. And then we finish up with small things counts because I know we didn't decide that today.

### You (2025-10-07T22:41:40.744Z)

Yeah. I had already. I sent out an email over the weekend about the bank as well, and I know we're out of time, so can we maybe discuss that on Thursday as well?

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:41:54.743Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-10-07T22:41:54.824Z)

Good. All right.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:42:08.103Z)

So you're very quiet today, and I just want to make sure everything's okay with you personally.

### You (2025-10-07T22:42:11.464Z)

The Rock just needs some sleep, that's all. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:42:17.383Z)

Well, you're a rock. You're a love. You're right. So thank you.

### You (2025-10-07T22:42:20.264Z)

All right. Thank you. All right, we'll see you guys.

### Guest (2025-10-07T22:42:23.463Z)

All right, all right.
