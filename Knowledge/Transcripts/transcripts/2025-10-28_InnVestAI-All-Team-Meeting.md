# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:31:28.014Z)

Hey, guys.

### You (2025-10-28T21:31:29.694Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:31:32.254Z)

Just. Watching. Your video.

### You (2025-10-28T21:31:36.174Z)

Oh. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:31:38.174Z)

Yeah, it looks like it's what we discussed, and I think it's pretty straightforward.

### You (2025-10-28T21:31:42.814Z)

I think so, yeah. I'm just waffling back and forth. And building in logic. Versus just having the user tell us what year is year one. Right. I think for the most part, it would be pretty obvious. But what happens if somebody buys a property in January or early February? Would you go for almost an entire year as year zero, and then the next year becomes year one? Would they consider a partial year? I guess. I'm not quite sure. I think there's different ways it could be done.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:32:27.534Z)

Yeah, that I think. Yeah. Like right now, it's October. So if somebody starts analyzing or underwriting hotel. Year zero is going to be next year.

### You (2025-10-28T21:32:42.254Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:32:42.734Z)

Yeah. I mean. Well, yeah, and it is a little bit. Because. From. I guess you're going to. Have. For the purposes of evaluation, summary and calculating returns. Year. Zero is next year. But for the but there when you're doing that pro forma. Tab. With the pro forma inputs. You don't have a complete. You know, 20, 25 yet, so you almost have to have.

### You (2025-10-28T21:33:23.694Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:33:25.214Z)

Like year zero. You have to have, like, a projection for this year and for next year. So you kind of almost have to have a projection for year zero and your minus one. Which. I mean. Because. Like if I'm letting go. Share my screen. Here. Right? Like you have 20, 25 projection. For the sort of rest of year projection. This year. Which would also be year zero. But if year zero, you know, it's going to be 20, 26, then you'd still need something to project. Yeah, so. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-28T21:34:15.534Z)

Those are probably edge cases. Maybe. I don't know. I guess. Everybody's going to probably handle it differently.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:34:25.774Z)

Well, it's. It's. They're not. I mean, I would say. It's not something that's going to be relevant until the beginning, until the end of the year. Then it'll be. Then it'll be relevant because all the deals will be like that.

### You (2025-10-28T21:34:36.334Z)

Right. Cool. All right. Yeah. Just let me know if there's anything else you can think of. But if not, I'm going to go ahead and start documenting. So Benode and the team. Can. Start working on it.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:34:53.454Z)

If a node. Hey, mark. All right. Drew and Howard. I hope you got my email regarding the staging environment.

### You (2025-10-28T21:35:09.694Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:35:10.734Z)

I think that's where we'll probably finalize the. Remaining work for the mvp. And before that, I just wanted to focus more on the demo part. So, I mean, whenever you guys get time, if you could please test from that environment. And then let's figure out what is remaining for demo particularly. We'll just focus on that first before doing anything else.

### You (2025-10-28T21:35:37.214Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:35:38.494Z)

Yeah, I did already spend, like, 15 minutes or 30 minutes in it this afternoon, and I sent you a video. Yeah, Some of the and I did ask the question that because some of the feedback, like some of the things that I found. Are things I've noticed before. So, like, for example. Sorry. So, like, one of them being? That on the. I don't know what if you're looking at my screen or not, but I'm looking at your screen. Yes. So on the, you know, the, the dashboard for the property that I created, the deal I created, This net operating income. That's showing up in the financial. This is not just going to go away. Yeah, it's. This is the number showing is GOP and it should be noi. So, again, like, I assume that you guys were aware of that. Just not doing it. So I was. My question was, should we be listing some of this stuff out? Let's put that list in the items remaining for the demo. And then it'll just, you know, kind of check them out once they are done.

### You (2025-10-28T21:36:59.294Z)

Would it be helpful to know if we just had a central document where we could all put our comments in that way? We know if we made a comment 2 weeks ago and it's still in there, that we don't have to write it down again. I know that Drew is. It's very helpful for Drew to do the videos.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:37:14.334Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-10-28T21:37:19.134Z)

But, yeah, I'm in the same position. It's like, oh, did I mention that to the team last week, or did I forget?

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:37:25.694Z)

Yeah. Yes. Yeah, video. I mean, video is fine, but, yeah, if we have the list as well, that would be great. Video. Very, very helpful.

### You (2025-10-28T21:37:33.694Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:37:36.494Z)

To the developers. But then if we have to keep a checklist, That would be great.

### You (2025-10-28T21:37:43.374Z)

Yeah. Let's give some thought to how we can set up where we could have that document that we would all be working on the same version. And wouldn't be stepping on everybody's toes or repeating ourselves endlessly. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:38:00.494Z)

Yeah, I agree. I think that would be a good idea. Just. Well, yeah, I don't know what would be the best. I mean, I've used smartsheet in the past, but I think you probably don't need to get another something additional here. Probably just use an Excel file that's on the shared drive. As long as we're using it correctly.

### You (2025-10-28T21:38:15.134Z)

Yeah, yeah. Excel would be.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:38:23.294Z)

What? Where do you want, Howard? Do you have a place in mind for that? In the development folder? Or Vano, do you have place in mind for that?

### You (2025-10-28T21:38:35.054Z)

No. Yeah, I think anywhere on the team site is fine. Except Mark. Doesn't often log into the teams, so if he does any testing. You can share it with Mark at his on his business email. You just have to manually share it within teams. Clicking on those three dots.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:38:58.414Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-28T21:38:59.054Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:38:59.134Z)

Well, I think by the time Mark is testing it, there should be less feedback. Right? I mean, the vast majority of the things in the checklist should be completed so that we can mark and take the perspective of somebody that.

### You (2025-10-28T21:39:04.174Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:39:16.334Z)

You know, where everything more or less should be. The formula should be correct, the decimals in the right place. That sort of thing.

### You (2025-10-28T21:39:24.254Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:39:25.774Z)

But we can just provide that in a, you know, probably back in an email.

### You (2025-10-28T21:39:29.054Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:39:29.934Z)

All right. I will put maybe an Excel file somewhere. And I'll just guess. Let's. Maybe I'll put it in here.

### You (2025-10-28T21:39:41.614Z)

Yeah, you can just. Yeah, just in the development file folder there, I think is fine. Vinod, quick question. When we are actually doing a demo. We may want to consider on the deal details making some fields not required. So that we can kind of go through quickly.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:40:06.734Z)

Yeah, sure, sure. Please put that in the feedback and we'll make those changes.

### You (2025-10-28T21:40:09.374Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:40:34.094Z)

I'll just put in video link too, because I record videos. I'll note. I'll put the link in the video in which I mention the particular item. So. Whoever's doing it can easily go and watch the video and see what it is I'm talking about. If they're not clear. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be great. Thank you. You know what? I'm also going to put in. Awesome. We should also put in the link of the particular page. On which. The. Thing. Right, so this way. Yeah, yeah. So just. I'll just try to be as specific as possible so that somebody can pick this up and go and know exactly what we're talking about.

### You (2025-10-28T21:41:29.214Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:41:30.334Z)

Yeah. This looks great. Thank you.

### You (2025-10-28T21:41:32.654Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:41:33.214Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-28T21:41:33.934Z)

Looks good.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:41:35.694Z)

All. Right. And I looked over, started to look over the video for. The year zero. And I think that looks good from a sort of logic perspective. I think you mark the Howard, the question that you posed a minute ago. Is a little bit. I have to think about that one. I don't want to over complicate it, but I also, you know, that is going to be something that as we get to the end of the year and people are closing deals for next year, year zero becomes. More confusing. And, Mark, just for your reference, what we're talking about is we putting. We're putting in logic, basically that when you're right, when you're doing your underwriting, The pro forma inputs part of it, where you're looking at historicals and projecting the future piece of it. Is on an annual basis. But then when we have for the valuation part of it, where you're calculating returns with your acquisition and your initial investment, your lender distributions, that's all that. Right. That needs to be a stub year. With like a kind of a year zero that has your initial cash outlay, your loan distributions, and then a stub year of cash. You know, cash flow from operations that were just. Do we have the ability to do it on a fiscal basis?

### You (2025-10-28T21:43:11.294Z)

We could.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:43:11.774Z)

That was the other. Yeah, that was the other option.

### You (2025-10-28T21:43:13.134Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:43:16.334Z)

I think the physical basis is more practical because, you know, all acquisitions happen at year end, obviously. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So the way that the we. Yeah, Howard and I did talk about that. And it in some ways is perhaps. Easier. My perspective was that it becomes confusing to. The user in the future. That they're not. You know, the fiscal year becomes an arbitrary. Well, the other way to do it is just to call the first year year one. And let the user put in the date. The dates. Right. So they could adjust it themselves so they could define what the first 12 months are, and then it could just recalculate on that basis.

### You (2025-10-28T21:44:04.174Z)

One of the things I considered is.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:44:05.454Z)

Just call it, like, what year? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and let them put the dates in.

### You (2025-10-28T21:44:09.054Z)

Yeah, yeah. That's. That's one of the options, but I was also thinking we could do both. You know, we could do it as Drew and I have been talking about having the year zero and, you know, pro rata between, you know, whatever the last month upload was through the end of the year or doing a fiscal year, just simply saying. Input your closing date. And that's gonna be the end of your fiscal year, and you can keep going on like that. And like you said, just. Just inputting. There's multiple ways of doing it, and I don't think we have to be. Doing just one. I think it's possible to do multiple.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:44:50.334Z)

I mean, clearly, the more flexibility, the better, right? The users can kind of custom create it the way they want.

### You (2025-10-28T21:44:52.894Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:44:57.534Z)

It.

### You (2025-10-28T21:44:57.614Z)

Ep.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:44:59.294Z)

Yeah, I think. Yeah. I guess doing the fiscal year does get around the issue of. What if you're closing is next year, I guess. Because then. Doesn't matter if it's next year, because you're going to start, you know, you're. You're going to start. Your. Your one. You know, on that. Whatever that date is. So. I'll think about that a little bit more. But, I mean, yeah, Howard, if we can. Fiscal year is probably the easiest. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-28T21:45:33.294Z)

It would. It would be the easiest.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:45:34.494Z)

Definitely.

### You (2025-10-28T21:45:34.654Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:45:35.854Z)

Yeah, it would be easier. Lonnie Howard, are you comfortable? Is that? If we build in both, you know, or put documentation for both, and then.

### You (2025-10-28T21:45:48.574Z)

Y. Eah. We already have to put in the closing date in the valuation section. So it would just simply be a toggle. You can check which one. You know, what do you want to use? You want to use a fiscal. And if that case, if the box is checked, then we just use the closing date. As the fiscal year end. Or beginning year end. Or if they want to go with a calendar year and doing the pro rata, we've all. That's. That's what I've got here in this sample. So, you know, we could easily just have a toggle.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:46:26.734Z)

All. Right. Well, yeah, if for the sake of. Because I, you know, want to be cognizant of timing. And having. Something functional, you know, as soon as possible. So if the fiscal year is easier. You know, to start with, and then we can add in the stub year. Methodology, you know, in be one or after the first few months, right? So that maybe that's the approach to go.

### You (2025-10-28T21:46:53.374Z)

Well, I don't know that fiscal is going to be any easier from a development standpoint because then we have to consider, you know, shifting dates and building logic for that. Whereas in this, you only, you take your most recent financial statement, you do your projection for this year, and then it's one minus the other. Equals. Your pro rata column.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:47:21.774Z)

Yeah. Yeah. By the way, I've been easy. I meant easier from the user's perspective. It may just be more practical.

### You (2025-10-28T21:47:24.974Z)

I don't know. From the user's perspective, yes. And so, Vinod, I guess in my experience, dates are tricky. Whereas simply doing a math of this minus this equals that. From a development standpoint, the pro rata might actually be easier. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:48:00.414Z)

We know you broke up a little bit there. Yeah. What I was saying is we could please put both of them. In the documents. Then we'll see which is doable.

### You (2025-10-28T21:48:12.254Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:48:19.694Z)

All right. Otherwise. Yeah, I was going to go through and test the input output functionality. On the avm next. And do a recording of that. And. I think that's. I mean, I think that's it. I mean. Howard. Anything from. I mean, any. Anything else that we. Need to talk about from a product perspective at this point.

### You (2025-10-28T21:48:55.374Z)

No, not really. Yeah, you. You sent the email this. This morning about the AI augmented, and I totally agree. It's not something that we need to do today. It's. It's.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:49:07.774Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-10-28T21:49:09.614Z)

Our reaching. So, you know, if you've got 10 minutes to read through it and just jot down some ideas, that would be great. It doesn't mean we're going to be working on it right now. So still.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:49:19.294Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-28T21:49:21.774Z)

A lot of pages, but there's a lot of white space in each page, so it's not. Doesn't take quite as long to get through it as you might think. So the sooner I can get feedback that there would be better off with that, but, yeah, we're not gonna. We're not. Gonna bring in the developers on that for quite a while.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:49:44.094Z)

Drew. What happened to the llc? I need to. I. I finished it, Diane, and I still need to. Go over it. We were going to do that this weekend, but I think. I got overwhelmed with stuff that was going on outside of work, so I'll send her. I'll just send her my notes and she can look through it. But, yeah, it is. It is otherwise. I mean, it is otherwise from my point of view. You know, close to done. Okay? And I know you guys want to look over as well, just here in the group, so whoever gets touched in our look. Yeah, yeah, I will. I will. All right. Thank. All right. Anything else? I mean, Diane said. I did talk to her a couple days ago, late last week. She said the safe note with. Driftwood that. It sounds like they are committed, like they're moving ahead with it. It's just a matter of they're just going through their steps internally, whatever those might be. But it should be just. A few days or a week or so until they have that completed. Which is good. Any do they get back to us on, you know, meeting the team? I think they. They do. That was also something that was agreed to. And I did clarify with Diane that, like, it's, you know, we should, it should be an intro call, very much like, you know, meet and greet, the team. You know, before we get any into anything product related. So that's something that she's gonna schedule as well. Okay, great. No, I mean, it's more for their benefit, I would think, but yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. I think. That's all I can think. How could they not like us? I think that's all I can think of. Mark. And Mark, I'll play. I'll send you the. I guess I'll send out to everybody the latest budget. And, you know, and pitch deck. I mean, nothing's changed much. But just so you know, everybody can, you know, have fresh eyes on it. All right. Yeah. Just in terms of finalizing it. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-28T21:52:13.774Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:52:15.534Z)

All right. Cool. Thanks. And then, Howard, I. Howard, I'm working on a marketing sort of plan, and, you know, the different people that I intend to reach out to. So I'm just doing it sort of in Excel, and then once it's done, I'll ship it over to the database.

### You (2025-10-28T21:52:31.054Z)

Okay? Yeah, no problem. I was just concerned that maybe I had a bug in it where I wasn't able to view what people were inputting, so I just needed to find out whether or not people have been putting in there, so, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:52:42.014Z)

Okay? No, no issue. I'm just working on it.

### You (2025-10-28T21:52:45.054Z)

Well, that. Yeah, yeah, no, that's fine. No worries.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:52:49.614Z)

Yeah. Okay, great.

### You (2025-10-28T21:52:51.054Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:52:53.054Z)

All. Right, thanks. All right. Thanks, guys.

### You (2025-10-28T21:52:55.934Z)

See you guys later.

### Guest (2025-10-28T21:52:57.934Z)

Thank you very much.
