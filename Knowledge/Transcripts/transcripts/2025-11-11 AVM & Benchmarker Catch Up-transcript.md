# Transcript for: AVM & Benchmarker Catch Up

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:00:58.233Z)

Hey, everyone. Hey, Diane. Good to see you.

### You (2025-11-11T21:01:01.033Z)

Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:01:02.473Z)

Here on mute there, but I think it's been quite a while. Since we were last on a call. Jeremy. Bark. Bill. How are you guys? Good. How are you all? It's great to see you. Yeah, same here. I'm in the car because I got caught, believe it or not. In a snowstorm coming from Stockbridge. Back to Connecticut. You did. Oh, my gosh. There's no snow here, but it was actually sticking to the ground and coming down pretty heavily up in Western Mass. So you'll laugh about this because, well, Mark and I are both in Atlanta. Jeremy, you're in Atlanta, too, right? I'm in D.C. you're in D.C. okay. Well, then just Mark. And I. People are running around Atlanta like, oh, My God, it's 20 degrees. It's snowing. Right? And it's funny to watch Southern. I don't know if you guys could. I'll see if you can see this. I'm actually at our place in New Hampshire. Diane, let me look. Out the window. Oh, yeah. A little bit of snow. Yep.

### You (2025-11-11T21:02:09.033Z)

Michigan, so. Actually, I think we have a little bit more snow on ground. I can't see the grass right now.

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:02:14.073Z)

Yeah, it's just. It was just starting to accumulate. And, Jeremy, I know you like to collect trivia. So what does it mean when the snowflakes are really big? But then all of a sudden, they're getting really small. I think it means it's getting colder. That's very good. Did you know that? Are you just guessed at it? That's my guess. Yeah. So the big flakes are now little ones. So we're thinking I might actually add up a little bit. Trivia team. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. I know that this is. I mean, you've all heard my song and dance on this for years, but I wanted to introduce you to my colleague, Howard. Howard and I have been working on this for a year together. He and he'll introduce himself in a moment. But he came from the multifamily space where he was the product manager for, at the time, the leading multifamily ABM software called Rediq, which was owned by Berkadia. And then there were some, I mean, corporate things. We all know what those are. I mean, the whole thing at C Beren, the research team unraveling has been brutal to see and what's happening with everyone. He went through something similar with the transition to Radix, but that freed him to work on this with me, and we've partnered on it and I really couldn't have done. We could not have done this without Howard because it really took having a product manager know how to create software for us and then marrying that technology knowledge with hospitality underwriting. So I'll leave it for introductions and we'll run through short introductions because I know we don't have a full hour today, but we really have done it. We have created software at SaaS based and it's the equivalent of a. And this is again, this is the mvp. Right. So keep in. Mind. This is the scooter version, which is what you're advised to do is don't build the Cadillac, build the scooter. Right. But it's the equivalent of pipeline management, like deal path plus an avm, which is like a bit like how rediq approached it, which is just speeding up. How people can bring in data and automating the data extraction piece of it. So it's not manual anymore, it's all AI driven, and we're using AI tools to do that right now. And we're having very good success. Not exactly where we need it to be, but getting better every week. And far beyond our expectation. And we're ready to start doing demos in the beginning of December or early January. And so, I mean, this is a dream of mine, right? I'm sitting today doing some contract budget work for a client and I have spent the entire of two days doing nothing but downloading, copying and pasting data in Excel just to line it up so I can do the analysis I need. And so that's what we're doing. We're creating that ability to take out the grunt work and speed up the underwriting with InnVestAI and then I'm gonna just flip it really quick for Howard. Howard, this is two of my great, like, mentors and friends on the phone. Bill and I have known each other since I was very young in my career. And he has saved me on many occasions and just various things, like where, you know, maybe I can't find a seller for an asset, and Bill just somehow mysteriously turns up with a buyer that would work for a very, you know, difficult asset to dispose of. He's given me great advice. He's helped me just understand some complicated things about our industry. And Mark has done the same for me as well. When I was leaving CBRE and I was a bit heartbroken about the whole thing. After how hard I worked, Mark really helped me understand the input perspective on it because he had been through something similar. And Mark and I share a passion around data and how to use data and how to monetize data effectively for our industry. And then last, Jeremy comes from a fantastic background. Marks very lucky. To have him. He was with Calibri. Right. Jeremy, if I have this. Right. And so you worked with. We've talked about Calibri a bit. They have the Hummingbird product, but. And they're now doing a profit product as well. A benchmark or product. But he joined Mark. But has this really. Unique background of both consulting work, but also a lot of data and data work from his calibri side. So I just wanted to set the stage so everyone knows who everyone is and why everyone here is. You know, I'm like, you're all my fan favorites, and I'm happy to introduce you to each other. Well, Diane, first of all, thank you for the kind remarks, but critically. Bill's also tells wonderful jokes, Howard, so be ready for that. He's great joke downer. And, Diane, it's not helpful when you make Jeremy feel good. Yes. Why does he want more money then? It goes to my head, so we have to be careful. Yeah. So, Howard, go ahead. You want to jump in and just say a few?

### You (2025-11-11T21:07:58.073Z)

Yeah. Very quickly, I think Diane hit the highlights.

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:07:58.633Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T21:08:04.553Z)

Just to kind of understand. Over 30 years. Pretty much in the multifamily day and making. But prior to moving over the dark side with technical bending, Distribution and renovation. Had. I built it here on the technical side, but also 13 years prior to moving over. My first opportunity with Real Page where I was inbalanced at the time, still in the asset. But I had some connections who worked at Roll Page. And I had the reputation of being focused on Linux, they asked me to help. With creating their first centralized warehouse. And reporting product. And that's where I got bitten by the tech dog. And a lot of work. And tubing, remote space. Working sustainability and running 21 IQ, full circle, back to the last step, management underwriting tool, et cetera. Happy to be here. Speaking with down here for quite a while about this. She first approached us. For hospitality. They thought of rebuilding idea to have IQ type of product in hospitality space. But it's only one thing to addicts and. It didn't work out on their part, but I talked to everybody from what I do downside. Taking it seriously. Nothing like it, man. Be something like it. Every asset class has an admiration. Sure enough, when I started working with it, looking around my eyes could not find any competitive product to what we're putting together for the ovm. Everybody stand. Ing with what we can put together here.

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:10:56.473Z)

And I'm curious. Howard. Thank you. That was helpful. Diane, I probably asked you this before, but. And I have an answer to my own question. But I'm really interested in what you all say. And build, Build. Particularly you. Why do you think it is? That no one's created this mousetrap yet for hotels. Well, I think my reason is that the hotel industry sits on an island by itself. Sometimes I'll call it the island of Granola where we forget that we're a commercial real estate asset class and kind of are. I don't know. Sometimes we can be a little uppity as feel a sense of superiority because of the complexity of our data, how hard it is. Other CRE sectors just, you know, are so much simpler. But what has happened is over the past decade, other CRE products have actually created tools. Like pipeline management and AVNs. And yes, they're less data intensive, we're much more data intensive. But we have great data and data integration on the property operations side. We just don't have it on the real estate side. But over the past decade, Groups like DealPath and Deal Cloud and pair of you. And I can name probably 10 others, including multifamily AVMs that solve real estate problems. Right. But this is my answer to it is I don't think we always know what's going on in the real estate space. And so it's taken a partnership between people who know what's going on in the real estate space. And people in the hospitality space who say, oh, wait, we need a solution too, right? But no one from the real estate space is coming to save us, because nobody cares about hospitality, right? Marc, you. That's what we talked about at cbre. It's like hospitality is too small for CBRE to care about hospitality. Is too small for deal path to care about. So it's a really big opportunity for us because we can see how deep it can go. But no one from real estate is coming to save us in hospitality. We have to create this product ourselves. And I think that it also takes people understanding what systems like hotel, investor apps, right? What you guys are doing, what they can do from a bi perspective, what profit soared and actable can do, what O Tellier can do what calibre can do. Because when Lighthouse can do. Right, because when you start to see how the operational data could pipe into real estate, then you can see the solution for our industry. That's my. That's my take on it. But what's your rationale and why you think. I don't want to answer that. Ok. Wow. No, I'm kidding. I will. But, Howard, have you been hanging around Diane enough yet that you have an answer to my question?

### You (2025-11-11T21:14:09.833Z)

I have a different perspective. Come up to the hotel. Industry looking at technology in general. One of the things I think. Caused this type of 200mb classes is they rather may have to accept a different financial statement, but they all have rent rolls as well. The amount of labor that it takes to extract the similar rent roll and from the financial statements and everything else, I think probably. Just caused. People to realize sooner than in the hospitality space. And I also think the lack of a network is a little bit different because being commercial real estate facilities, I would never work with anybody in hospitality space. I've got contacts in industrial, commercial, office, everything else they're walking that same in common with AI wanting space within the building to a consumer. And one thing we're talking. It could be a five or ten minutes, an office, different thing, hospitality. It almost has almost like a retail aspect to it, right? It's short term life. Summer morning. And there's no tools. There's nothing other transactional. Think people are really comfortable with Excel. More Southern than others. But I think that's the word because Excel is from errors. It's bold, it's known fact. That subjects have errors, that people who are they override a formula on high input into the at one point they forget about it and they go back and they can choose. So what's one thing that we've got? But what we offer, like Diane Welchman, the data extraction. I don't have to copy and paste. I can grab the spreadsheet over, drop it into my tool. It gets nothing. Process, we extract all the data and put it in the model. Where you wouldn't actually do anything. Copying formulas. It'll take them a fraction of the time to go through and underwrite the model. And then, of course, it's not the data. Right. We're learning be ingest or financial statements, but we can have them optimal report. If you're talking about partnerships with other people, for example, We'll be uploading marketing data. As well as the financial bring in from other places. I may think that with a much dimension we can. Upset. Cosine on the salary group, replace it. But we also have forward looking data. We've got people who we are writing and forecasting what they think the equilibrate will be a little less. We are seeing five years. What do I think the calculates and the way. They have a lot more to offer than just an avm, right? The ABM is nothing more than formulas. Everybody can go together. So take those multiplied by the add Howard act or something. Get that? Right. That's not where the magic is, right?

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:18:19.913Z)

Yeah. Well, Howard. That sits you, bill. Thousands of hotels. Near in your career. In a very simplistic way of looking at it. There's only two variables that you're focused on. When you're trying to side what I'm willing to pay for this asset. And those two variables are its history. And the other being what you believe the future is going to be for that particular hotel. Bill. How much weight? Do you put on each of those two? Is it 50? 50, 70, 30? 10 90? Or does it depend on other variables? You know what it is, where it is, all that. Yeah. Let me sort of provide some context. Just so Howard is aware, I started my real estate career in multifamily. And then condominiums and then built office buildings. In the south. And then through a guy at Eastdale Realty, wound up in the hotel business and fell in love with it. But I think that the hotel business in general. Has always been slow to adapt to anything new, and it's partially because to your point about short term leases, it's also the level of detail in the quick volatility. That can change. You know, profitability. Overnight. And so people are nervous about adapting new things until they see probability of there being effective. And then to Mark's question, I think you're right about the two primary factors, obviously. But they vary from deal to deal because the history may be relevant or not, depending on whether you're looking at a deep turnaround or repositioning for a new branding kind of situation versus you're buying for reit. Like when we had Watermark. And you were looking at luxury deals where the history was equally important for the prediction of the future. And in luxury, it was easier to predict. Frank Lloyd than in, you know, even a just normal, full service. Hotel, if you will. And then when you look at Courtyard and Select Service, that's altogether different. But we were talking about this today on a call with the Marcus people a bit. How do we evaluate the fact that we're changing a really trashed out place into something pretty special? But if we're going to look at the future, we've got to see what the mix of customers is. And how it's going to change over five to seven years. Within the context of now you've got a spa. You didn't have a spa before. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So it's just a much more complicated business. When I got to the hotel business, I looked at Tony Ferris, who was the head of operations. I'm coming in as the head of development. Having never done a hotel deal. And I looked at him and I said, so you're gonna have to stick me in a hotel all summer, Tony. And Tony's about six, four or five, you know, I'm standing there and he looks at me, puts his arm around me. He goes, you're a development guy and you'd actually go in one of these damn hotels all summer? Yesterday. I've got to. I need a vocabulary if I'm. Gonna talk to archetypes. So that's. That's how I started. Yeah. I've always felt that because the business component of hotels is so much greater than any other real property type, Right? That. That. That there's an inherent. And I guess I'll use this word purposefully, Howard, there's an inherent bias. To not believe. That it's just about the numbers. You know that somehow all you could do is add it up and divide by 10 and you got your. No, no, there's more. There's secret sauce involved. And so therefore, the idea that I could just answer a few questions and hit a button, and here's. Here's what my assets worth. So. So. I've always thought of Diane Tree. We talked about this over the because we in 2011. I still have the files. We have made a big presentation to senior management. I'm sorry, wasn't it was in 2015 to C. Beren showing them that we had built an avm. And the way we did it back then, Howard, was we took the appraisers of C. Beren and said, give us your appraisals. And that was one of the things that we did to test the accuracy. Of what we were coming up with. And we were consistently coming within that 3% error rate. That I think the industry naturally ascribes to traditional appraisals and so forth. So. So we made the pitch to get support to go ahead and build the thing out, because it was all done in Excel sheets back then and so forth. And the answer came back, well, it's going to kill our appraisal business. Our traditional appraisal business. So we don't want to do it. They didn't buy into the idea that. Well, wouldn't you want to own it? Because if we don't do it, someone's going to do it someday. But they the answer was no, because that's we're not willing to think it that long term. They didn't say it exactly the way, but that was it, so. Anyway, that's some of the things I've learned. But you don't need to convince me it's doable. Right. So I'm. I'm very interested to hear your approach and what you built thus far and anything we can do to help get it from where you are to wherever it is you want to go where. And I'm sure I speak for Bill and certainly Jeremy on that. We're all ears. We'd love to. And we're going to give you, like, a sneak peek, a short one, under the hood, because. I know, because we didn't block a full hour, and I want to be careful of everyone's time. And maybe this is just like a, you know, an initial conversation, and then you guys, we can take some more time to show you what we've done under the hood and how we've done it. But I also just want to put out there in the universe that with C. Berending the hotel research function, I mean, there could be an opportunity for us to partner on a revival of Benchmarker, because we are having great success with data extraction via AI. But still, the PNL data is structured data. And that data, when you even look under the hood at something like profit sword, like, and you can see how they're in hotel investor apps. Right. You can see how the data in the operating world it exists to be transferred to real estate quite easily via John Tech relationships or what we used to call APIs. Right. And the possibility of having in software benchmarking is where we want to go. But now you have this product that has been abandoned by cbre. And Mark, you're the creator of that. Like, that's your baby, right? And there really could be a way because one of the things we're going to be doing is going to meet with the management companies and going to meet well, the management companies will be a big part of it because we're going to be going after their underwriting teams as well. And one of the things we heard from management companies is that, you know, I, I would love an avm, because if I could just speed up this all, you know, all this manual process, it would be, it would be a great tool for me to have. I'm really tired of the copying and pasting. Copying and pasting, they're like. But all of my comparable data for Davidson, for Marcus, for Sage, for whatever sits in a different platform. So if I could be able to integrate that data so I can pull my own comps right into my underwriting. And that's where the idea started to click. Well, all right. There might be a way to accelerate the whole benchmarking and data kind of data integration from the management companies, because they could be a Persona and a user here. And so. And then. And then I'll just close that. I mean, I don't know what the relationship is with Robert Mandelbaum, what he signed, what he hasn't signed. We chatted with Will Webster last week, but it could. It really could be resurrected and there would be no better partner in the. World, I think, you know, mark you for us and potentially us for you, if you're interested in trying to go after something like that. So just, just, Just wanted to keep that on the horizon for us. Good. I thank you again. I'm really interested in figuring out a way to. To help, and obviously, when it's. All said and done to be part of whatever the outcome is. Knowing Jeremy as I do, he's probably bursting with a million questions. So, Jeremy, what's going through your head? Well, there. There are a lot of things going through my head. I'm trying to figure out what's the most relevant. I guess a quick thing is a caliber. I built all the underwriting tools that the real estate community uses when I was there. So if you order their version of a starport, that was me and my team when I was there, and we always had internal fights about, does this need to go online or not? And I was screaming from the top of the mountain, this needs to be Excel, because everybody underwrites in Excel. And now it's 10 years later, and they just started their first online platform. I do not know how it's going. We're a subscriber to it, but it. It is not enough to underwrite and it's not the data or in the format that we need. So we still use legacy. Reports. So it's just kind of the first sector. Let me jump on that one. Because we see a world where and again, we all understand hospitality is way, way more complicated than probably office or retail or something like that. But it is going to be a migration away from Excel over time, and it will be in part because like the way we view this is start with that instruct and try to penetrate the market over the first six, nine, 12 months with a function that underwrites at a very high level. They have to underwrite a hundred deals very quickly. They're not going in to massive detail. Right on the underwriting. And try very carefully to also manage the expectation that if you work in the software, you get to have collaboration and you get to have version control, which is something. Once it leaves the software, you can't have the ability to have the version control. But if we keep it at a high level first. High level, and just think almost like a select service deal, right? Isn't that hard to underwrite a select service? And, Mark, I know Eva, like, you guys felt like you could peg a select service hotel down pretty quickly just by using 10 comparables, right? So kind of just start there and get your foot in the door and then in. The beginning, we're going to be working with Excel, you know, inputs and outputs just like everyone else. Over time, I think that is going to change and go more to in software or in AI, energetic AI platforms. Now, number two, though, how when you start to get to luxury and this is what Bill was talking about, right? And you're like, I'm going to reposition this hotel. It's going to be completely different. This has been the. I've spent my entire career working on value add, acquisitions and asset management, and this is very, very hard work to do. And it's also very hard because you don't. Have a roadmap between your acquisitions and then the pull through on the, on the asset management side. And so I, I truly believe that everyone, when they think of their secret sauce, their secret sauce. I bet it comes down to things that are somewhat similar. It's like a really deep, deep dive into segmentation, probably. By looking with seasonality involved, looking clearly by segments. Right? Diving deep into transient, diving deep into group driving, diving deep into. For example, Demand360 is a fantastic tool that we don't really use enough in underwriting, right? We use it more in asset management. But if underwriters could be trained in it I think they would start to feel like the secret sauce is coming into the software and potentially how we're using Agencic AI. Right. Because we like. I have a vision on the capex side. I want to be a year from now working with Procore, right. To try to bring up capex workflows. But those same agencic AI relationships can exist if done correctly. Right? In in the travel tech space with the lighthouses and the demand 360s and the Nolens. Noland is awesome data, right? That's very deep and can signal if you even have the ability to go after a real group. Strategy if you. If you use the Noland data. So let me just go back and answer. Start. Simple, right? Start where? Really, it's okay. You can get volume, and the underwriting is done at a very, very high level. And then sit down with the people who actually need the complex underwriting and work hand in hand with them to build out what they need in the software, that is they're almost secret sauce. But what you're doing is you're helping them aggregate that data at lightning speed so that they're not. Spending a week just aggregating the data to do the simple analysis. Does that make sense? It's like that's. Yeah, that's my second question. So, everything I think I've heard you and Howard described, do you know what Argus is? Yes. It's an underwriting tool for Bill and Mark. It's an underwriting tool for basically everything else. It's not a hotel. To me, what you've described sounds like Argus, not an automated valuation model. Unless I'm missing something about that, it's actually going to tell you what the value is no of your asset. Well, the reason I have such a reaction about Argus is because Argus is about us. Outdated. It's not great, but it's moved away from Excel. Right. But because I underwrote an Argus back when I did Office as well in retail, and so I don't have a super high opinion of what Argus does. This is something I view as very different. It's like. It's almost like a bit what the operational BI companies are doing when they're streamlining budgeting and some things like that by bringing data together. But it wouldn't be. It's more akin to in the multifamily space, rediq used to be the leader, but now other companies like Archer has catapulted over them because. And Howard can speak to this more because of the AI. The AI use strategy. And that they're not locked in with legacy systems like an Argus is. But it's just. It's gotta be. It's got to be so much more. Just agentic AI Driven than Argus ever was. Sure. I guess. From what I understood, Mark's old C beren AVM was for every hotel in the US it could tell you what that's worth today. Without you telling it anything. And that's first my understanding of what cbre, what Mark you had worked on, and my understanding of what you then and Howard are explaining is there's a lot of inputs and then it does the math for you. Which may be a very important distinction. So I think you kind of. Again, let's go back to the simple, right? The very simple is it does. It pulls all the inputs in, but you still need a person to actually look at it. But probably a lot quicker than what it was before, right? It may be a 10. Minute look versus a two day look on what it was. But then secondly, I will say Howard in his off time is starting to play around with something that's very similar to Mark, what you did with Eva. We've initially targeted it more like a red eyed, like an AI augmented version of RedIQ. But Howard in his off time right now is starting to play around with. Could you really just. Pull the right data points and have the model value the asset. And that's far more the case in select service. Right. Than it is in full service. So, Diane and Howard, how do you. The model that we built. One of the inputs was our forecast. For that particular market. And at the end, Howard, we had, we covered 65 of the largest MSAs in Atlanta and that covered, I don't know, 600 sub markets within those 65 MSAs. But that was one of the inputs. The current forecast. For that market. And we had done the research that demonstrated, on average, 80% of what a hotel would do. Was systemically linked to the behavior of the overall market. So if you had a view for what the overall market would do. That's 80% of the answer. The other 20% is where you start getting into the nuances of what's unique to that particular property. Stuff like that. Which as an aside, I'd like to have a future call with Jack Cordial and Howard. Jack and I were been partners for 30 years on stuff and he helped. He was. He comes with academic background. Ran the real estate department at Granola out of the hotel school, but he helped us build the forecasting. Products that we had. If you happen to have heard of Ray Tordo or Bill Wheaton, they had a company called Tortoise Wheaton Research. Bill came out of MIT, red came out of UMass. But they were academics, but they had built forecasting models for all the other property types, multifamily. Industrial, retail, etc. And I thought of this right at the beginning of this call because Bill Wheaton reached out to us because he had clients. They're saying, can't you do a forecast for hotels? We think we want to start putting capital into the hotel space, but we don't understand. Why the first quarter is so different than the second quarter. Is no different than third. So it's like they had no concept of the seasonality of the business. And so part of the challenge was, how do you. How do you address that? And at the time, you know, Bill, at that time, Randy had been around for 15 years or so. So Randy Smith had begun to accumulate enough data. Over. By that point in time, we'd gone through at least two complete cycles that we could look at the data and develop the models. To then with a pretty good level of reliability. Predict the future. So again, I don't want to be Johnny Onenote on that, but no, it's really want to understand. And Bill, I'd be surprised if you disagreed, but I think that's a critical element. Because I think the sophisticated user is going to want to understand how are you answering that question? So it would have been if you would have asked me this six months ago. It would have been we would have been using cbre, Horizons and larc. However, the whatever the client wanted, right. We want to have as much data data relationships as we possibly can. Horizons is not going to exist if I understand right, Mark, they're pulling the plug on that. LARC is very interested in working with us and I know, yeah, a strong opinion about their forecasts and if they're accurate or accurate based on the inputs that they use, I will come at it from maybe a more micro way because I've always worked in the assets. Themselves. And that is you have to break apart the segmentation. And if you just look at a select service hotel and you say, OK, I'm 95 transient and 5 group and I'm 20 to 25% bar, right? And I'm now 25% discount, how do I start to have better agentic AI relationships with some of the revenue management software out there. That might be able to give me insights. I mean. Granted, when there is a huge hiccup in the economy, they go berserk because they don't have the history anymore. The systems go berserk. But there is a way to start to have a better agentic relationship with some of those revenue management providers to be able to say, all right, well, we think that bar in the Boston area, we have enough information on it, right? If we're working with Lighthouse or others. And Jeremy, maybe this gets back to calibre because I know Cindy had that level of detail. You know, you may be able to say, ok, we are never going to be able to get above X. And bar, unless it's a very, very high compression month. Right. And so you're starting to use that data and pool it into your overarching analysis. You might look at discounts and say, OK, at 20%, we're never going to be able to climb above. 140, 145. Right. And then that's inflation adjusted just because that's the nature of that sector. And then I'll say the scariest thing at all, which is we might. None of us might not. We might not know because of what's happening so quickly with AI and booking. And booking channels and patterns. Right. Like how this is going to change for our industry over the next five years and it could be completely different than it is today. But I'm going to circle back. Mark, you're absolutely right. You do need to have attached to some data. If it's, if it's. Broader or macroeconomic, or if you're starting to try to break it down into more segment data and tie into some of the revenue management software and forecasting that they do and use that better than we have in the past. What? Are the working with Jack over these many years. I have this developed this view that it needs to have three attributes. I have to be able to understand what you're telling me. Ok. Ok. And that's helpful. If the structure is actually fairly simplistic. It's not complicated. So that's why when larc says I can give you a revpar forecast, For any hotel on this city block in New York. I say. That's a very simple thing for me to understand that you. You say you can do that? But I don't believe you. So the other thing is, it has to be not just understandable, but I have to. I have to believe what you're telling me is actually doable. And when Brian does that stuff, I realize I look at things like they really look like I do I just say I stop listening when you tell me something that I don't believe. Period. And I think whatever growth that he's. I've done, I hope OB succeeds. I think whatever growth he's getting is because he's stepping into a bit of a vacuum. And frankly. And, Bill, I hope you take this the right way. But, Bill, when all the you, you look at these deals, you look at things you always want to. I, I think. You know, is there a third party? That that you can turn to to that corroborates your view. Sure. And the more credible that third party is, the more valuable they are to you. Because then you get your deal done. It doesn't mean Bill doesn't want to only use people. That rubber stamp stuff he begins with. I think this firm or this person knows what they're doing, and what they're telling me they're going to do is believable. I can understand it. So anyway, so those are some of that attributes. As your product continues to come together. That's good feedback that it needs to be simple enough that people can. I'm going to be looking for the Jeremy. I know that look on your face. What? What are you saying? Yeah. So trying to bring CAL bearing is 19 rate categories of data. To the underwriting world was very challenging. Even though we tried to create the same data format that STR used, that you could just take our data and put it in your model, not change anything. But just adding on to mark's point, 19 rate categories was like 14 too many. And although they're really valuable to someone that spent 30 years doing revenue management, they're really overwhelming to someone doing underwriting. It also makes you susceptible to making more mistakes. So if you get one month of bad data from ihg, but someone's looking at all your data to really granular level, it's very apparent that Calvary did something wrong and it wasn't their fault. But because they're exposing the data at that detailed level, we were constantly getting questions and people not believing our data. So that's kind of Mark's second point. The more detailed you go, the more exposed you are to issues and to not appearing believable. But really, the underwriting community understood the value of segmentation, but didn't didn't feel that it was the worth the extra step to underwrite to it. They were interested in it. Right. But could I ask you maybe just a future question? If they no longer have to spend five days copying and pasting data just to get an underwriting model to work? Actually, Jerry's Rose at cbr. He asked me this question. She's a good friend and mentor of mine, too. She's like. All right, Diane, she's like, well, so, you know, we can't get through these bovs fast enough. We're working, like, through the night. We can't find enough analysts to get through this. It's killing us. But if we could speed it up and we could get through a bov and. Say a half hour versus days. What do the analysts do then? Right. And my answer was, you go deeper because we're not going deep enough. That's sometimes what the problem is when you say, ok, why didn't this deal work out? Well, you didn't go deep enough to understand that. You assume I'm just gonna make up not something right now. You thought you had a viable group strategy, but no one truly vetted the Nolan data to say like, oh, there is group date, there is group in this market, or, oh, there is group in markets 90 minutes away that I could pull from. You just assumed. You could, like, increase your group, but you didn't like. And I think that's the answer is that when analysts can have the free time. Then even part of the monetization strategy of something like this for us is some sort of future training program that helps them get better at underwriting revenue. Especially because as someone who has underwritten and then been the one been responsible for execution, it's always blamed on the asset manager. But I gotta tell you, a lot of times. It's just that enough. Not enough work was done up front. Totally agree with that. To validate if it was. Actually, I need to ask Howard a question. Howard, do you still liken this hotel stuff? Just checking, Just checking.

I have adhd, so anytime I can learn something new and do something different on that form,

### Guest (2025-11-11T21:47:26.153Z)

Good. I think he's probably a little more drawn towards Hampton Inn than Four Seasons. There you go. But I've got to jump. But this has been super helpful, and I want to, like Mark said earlier, come back and do a real detailed thing. So how do we do that? I mean, like early December. Does that sound good? I get an hour on your calendar and we take you guys under the hood and show you what it is and all of that or how do you want to do go about this? Yeah, jeremy. I'll speak for both of us, but we can make ourselves available. I would. If you're okay with that. I'd like Jack. Cordial to join us on the next one. Yeah. Get his reaction? He invariably asks questions that I don't think of, so it's. It's helpful. Yeah. And again, just for Howard benefit, Jack was the creator of kind of what you're playing around with now with, like, the agentic AI and can you just pull variables and, like, come up with the value of. You know, you've been talking about the last three, four weeks as you've been. Thinking more about how AI can actor and evaluation. But you guys get like, at the end of the day, the strategy is connect, end to end acquisition through disposition. And so it's pipeline management, it's valuation. The next workflow is renovation and capex. Right? It's starting to go in and say, how many project managers use Procore? How many project managers use North Spray? If they don't use those tools, what do they use? Are they using Excel? Let's just cry river if that's actually the case, because that's just very, very sad if that's happening on the project management side, right? How do you potentially work with partners that may be involved with like FFNE or certain aspects of the business, but have valuable relationships with Berends and to bring a tool that has an agenda relationship with the GC software out there so that we can speed up and have better data when it comes to renovations, so that and then another workflow which is very important is that legal is being digitized, and there's a platform called Harvey that has become the outright winner when it comes to legal real estate. And the hotel attorneys like Megan Cochee, she's their. They're instituting Harvey right now at her firm. So how do we line up when Dealpath has their arm out and says, hey, Harvey, we want to have a relationship with you, so we're trading workflows. We need to be there, right? With them saying, hey, we're the hotel solution. We want to have an agent relationship with you. And the domain expertise probably needs to live within Harvey, because legal is very. I mean, it's. It's. The domain expertise is ridiculous, and the risk around regulation, but the workflows. In and out of like a command central for deals is what we need to be working on. How do you start to create workflows around the closing of a hotel? So the management checklist, right when you're taking over a hotel, the prorations, the real estate tax prorations. And then I'm going to get to what I think is an incredible, important strategy, which is actually feeding into the hud. Statements with the title companies and the closing statements, because this is the point I want to make, is that that has the actual purchase price on it, right? Clear as day. It has the purchase price on it. And if you also have an underwriting, underwriting software, you will have the actual noi noi divided purchase. Price is cap rate. Right. And we could have the first. Honest to God. Actual real cap rate database, which then goes back to driving valuations with real data. I mean that to your point, how much of it's historical, right? We need the cap rate information for that, and we call around each other, but are we really getting real cap rate information or are we getting adjusted cap rate information? Depending on who's looking at it. And that particular workflow, I think, is within two years for the real estate industry. But we just. We can be the solution for hospitality when it comes to all of that. And it's a pretty big market, but it requires the right team of people and. Yeah. So, thanks, guys. Hey, Bill. If you're like me in this, and in this way I know you are, it's getting really close to cocktail hour. I have one more call now about a new build, of all places. Fort Myers. So I'll call you back and ask for some data. Ok. All right. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate you all taking. Yeah. How are. Nice meeting you. Good to see you.

### You (2025-11-11T21:52:50.553Z)

Likewise speaking to you.
