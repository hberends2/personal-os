# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:31:28.875Z)

Hello. Hello.

### You (2025-11-11T22:31:29.979Z)

Good. How you doing?

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:31:34.315Z)

Yourself.

### You (2025-11-11T22:31:35.179Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:31:37.675Z)

Just stepped in. Just rest home. How was your day? My day was kind of, I don't know. Office was very empty. I felt very lost in office today. Any people. I felt very lost. There are not many people in office today. Yeah. I was all alone. Which makes it worse when you drive in, right? Right? Right. Yeah. Drive in for one hour, then you will see nobody. All right, where do we want to. I apologize. I only have a half hour tonight. I have to jump at 6. So how do you guys want to break down down the time? I want to start with the safe, no money stuff. Yeah. And I mean, super exciting that we got the sign, so that's awesome. I just wanted to go through, like, the mechanics. A couple things. One being like the mechanics of. How they're going to send money. And then, you know, the next thing you know, like, what we're going to do with it. So. Does that. Does that make sense? Sure you want to jump in with your thoughts? Yeah. I. I think so. Just. I thought I read in your email you said you were going to have them send you the money. And then you were going to take keep a portion of it. And then send the rest when we got a bank account set up. Is that what I. Oh, that's what I was thinking about. Yes. Okay. So. I don't think we can do that. For, like, multiple reasons. That are. Like tax and accounting. Reasons, you know, to say the least. I think driftwood. For one like that. That amount. 75,000. That amount needs to get sent to. The InnVestAI bank account when it's set up. So that they get full credit for it. If. If it goes to you and then it goes, you know, then only part of it goes to InnVestAI. Then it's like InnVestAI is not getting the full deposit amount. The. The second part of it is. Just. That makes like. Does that make sense? That part. I just. I just want to hear everything completely and be very open minded to what you have to say. So I'm. And listening. So. Okay, so this is just when it comes to compensation. And we've talked about this, but maybe hasn't been, like, totally clear. Right, like, and it's in the LLC agreement. It's been in all the versions of the LLC agreements. That we talk about distributions to owners. Right? Like, not like profit. A share of profits. You know, if the company makes profits, a million dollars a year, each of us gets our pro rata or pro rated share based on how much, you know, a percentage ownership. So that. That's an owner distribution. Right. So in order. So we, you know, we would each get, you know, $200,000 or whatever. So I think originally we had been or, you know, you would suggested as the easiest means of getting owner of getting, you know, compensation was to do an owner was to do like a distribution. And the problem with that? Well, one of the problems with that is that it doesn't like, when you do distributions of profits, they have to be like, according to the percentage ownership. So it's not really feasible for, you know, couple of people to get. Distributions and then other people not to get distributions unless those people that don't get distributions take some greater share of, like, you know. Equity or stock or, you know, like. Or something like that. The other. So, like we when I put in the business plan or the budget and the LLC agreement is that, you know, compensation just gets paid as a W2. Right. Like, we'll set up Gusteau and, like, everybody will get paid that way.

### You (2025-11-11T22:36:29.419Z)

So a couple quick questions. First off. If we did go with Diane's original suggestion. Could we just have a paper trail? Receipts, deposits, flips, everything to kind of show the journey.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:36:49.195Z)

I mean.

### You (2025-11-11T22:36:50.539Z)

Would be much cleaner if it was, like, directly into an InnVestAI, but. If she needs the money. If she's got the money coming. And if we just have a clear paper trail, I'm just wondering if that would suffice.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:37:06.795Z)

I mean, we can do, like, you can do journal entries in, you know, like, if we had a QuickBooks, like, you could do a journal entry. But that's still doesn't if the money doesn't get. Paid as a as like W2 compensation. Then, you know, because that. That means that there's, like, payroll taxes and. And other things. I mean, I'm not an accountant.

### You (2025-11-11T22:37:33.739Z)

Yeah, I'm just talking about the original deposit, the funds.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:37:33.755Z)

So.

### You (2025-11-11T22:37:37.819Z)

That we get from Driftwood. I'm not talking about the compensation. I'm just wondering. If between when she gets the check. And when we haven't accounted deposited in. I'm just wondering. If between that period, if we had documentation, Not what comes to ask and reopen the account.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:38:02.235Z)

I mean, maybe. It sounds like a audit risk to me. Not that we're, you know, likely to get audited, but, like, if we have an. I mean. I don't know. It seems. It seems like, you know, if we're gonna. If we have investors. The. The cleaner, like, the more professional we make things. The better it's gonna be. Right. So.

### You (2025-11-11T22:38:31.419Z)

I'm sorry. Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:38:32.795Z)

Right. So that. That's part of my, like. I. I think it's like, as much as possible have the money go straight, you know, we should have the money go straight to the InnVestAI bank account. When it opens, which can be, I think, you know, done pretty quickly once the operating agreement is complete. And then we can set up Gusto, you know, do payroll and I. And the second part of this. Like this is all gonna have tax implications. Like company. Any money that we receive or if we receive money. I don't know, like, what if that. Like, if there's tax implications, like filing a tax return for the company and whatnot. But if we start, you know. Like, we had. We need a tax person basically, to, like, run by all of this, to create, you know, open and close the books and do all that and. We? You know, I'm not. I don't have the. I don't have the knowledge or resources to do all of that, but I know that it needs to be done. And in the short term, right? Like it is possible that if the 75,000 goes to. The bank account, the company bank account. Like. Some amount can be, like, sent to both of you and then sent and then to use for, like, a loan, basically, and then sent back when we get W2 payroll set up. Or it can be even sent back in a short period of time. I just. I know we. We're gonna have to file taxes, and I'm like, I don't have the resources or the time to, like, figure that out right now.

### You (2025-11-11T22:40:11.259Z)

Second question. I have. I think we talked about this. I just don't remember what the final answer was. Is that? I thought the ll Sightsee said that we could make distributions, but the recipients had the option to defer them. So in this example, if we made an $8,500 distribution, but the rest of us just defer it, Diane is the only one that gets. The money. I don't remember. What? The final decision. Was on that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:40:47.275Z)

I mean, I had said that. I think I feel like owner distributions doing it that way. You know is not. As professional because it, you know, again. I mean, Driftwood did not ask for any. Anything. Any supporting documentation or anything like that. Which is. Which is fine. But I'm sure like other companies will, they'll look, you know, they'll want to look at our books. They'll want to see where money is gone and come from and make you. Know, if we got 75,000, and then it immediately starts going out the door like owner distributions are supposed to be for, like, when you get profit. Right? Like, that's what. That's. That's what it's for. If you have no profit, you shouldn't be taking owner distributions, which is. You know, so.

### You (2025-11-11T22:41:29.419Z)

Makes sense. I just couldn't remember.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:41:33.755Z)

Yeah, but.

### You (2025-11-11T22:41:33.979Z)

What the reasons were exactly when we left.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:41:35.515Z)

Yeah, but in the LLC agreement that I. That I sent, like it, the same thing is accomplished. At least I feel like the same thing is accomplished. It's just done a different way. You just get payroll instead of an owner distribution. That's not. You know, it's not meant to be. It's not meant. It's not meant to, like. You know, like, deny what. What was originally in there. It's literally just doing it in a way that I think is cleaner. You know, and. Yeah. I mean, so, I mean. Diane, thoughts? We need. Accounting advice. And no offense to everyone, it's just I've not been through this. Right. You're even through it a little bit, but I feel like we need accounting advice. Two. I just want to state. I mean, I need money to pay my mortgage, right? It's like it's not you. You got. I feel like. I just feel like to be a good partner to me and understand where I am right now, that there has to be some sensitivity to that piece of it so that stated out there. And this is a unique agreement. Right. Because I am trading my time with Driftwood for. And I'm not taking all of the money. Right. I'm. I mean, Howard getting some compensation out of this. There still is a little bit left over for other things. So I think for you, I. Mean, this is how I feel about it. For you guys to say that I can't take anything until, like, we can't figure out some interim solution so that I can at least pay my mortgage payment in November is kind of harsh for me. And you're standing on ceremony and things like that. When I'M sure there could be a paper trail. As Howard mentioned, it's not like we're just starting like if we get and if Driftwood knew what we were doing, I don't think they would be object. They would object to it. Future investors. Yes, I could see but by that we'll have the LLC done and a bank account set up. I do think we have a lot of issues in the LLC themselves, probably around compensation, fairness, you know, part time, full time, all of those things that we need to grapple with, and I don't know that that's going to be solved. By Thursday because. I just. I just feel like maybe there's some conversation that have been had that need to surface. I mean, are you and Mark viewing your compensation a different way than you did? Well, let me just actually start with one question. Just simply. I thought we were in agreement that when we got this $12,500 per month and we used it, you. You prorated per month that I would be paid 8,500. Howard would be paid 2000 and the balance would go into a general fund for whatever is needed. Software engineers, more income for them, legal expenses, like whatever it is that we needed. Did I misunderstand that? Are you guys saying something different on that? Well, I mean. To start with. I don't. Why are they paying us in installments? That would be like. Well, first, because we don't have a bank account. Right. And so they don't. They don't. I mean, I'm sure they do know that, but theoretically, like, that. They wouldn't know that. That doesn't matter. So, like an investment, you know, you make it upfront. Right it would be. There's no reason they shouldn't pay a 75,000. Tomorrow. Right. Okay. I just think you. I just think we just need to really walk carefully through this. I mean. We're really going to split hairs on all of this because initially I. Well, look, I don't want to get angry. I don't want to get angry, and I know I can be prone to do that. I want to listen, so. I mean this to be. Tell me what you just want to happen. Tell me exactly what you and Mark want to happen. Just bam, right through it. How much does each person get paid? What? Like, if we don't have a bank account for until January 1st, what happens? Just walk me through what you guys have talked about and what you want to happen. It's. I. I can do. Okay, we can do that. I can do that. But I just. It is. I'm not. I'm not trying to tell any of you. What needs to happen. I mean, I. I realize I am probably speaking in a way that makes it seem like I am saying this is what need to happen. Needs to happen. I mean, and I'm, you know, I'm not. I'm not an accountant, not a tax expert, not a small business expert, albeit, I do have my own, you know, like, so, like, I've been through this, but. You know, I want us to. We all need to come to an agreement. That is the way we, you know, like, we decided the business was going to be run is more not by consensus, but by. By, you know, majority. Right? Like, there's five of us. A lot of these decisions. These are all decisions that require, you know, a majority or super majority. Vote, right? So nothing requires. Well, a majority, right? Nothing. Unanimous. Nothing. I should. Nothing is unanimous. But these majority decision majority requires a super majority. Compensation is one of them. Okay, so we have to. All or four of the five of us have to agree on compensation, so. No, I don't think we agreed on what compensation is. I, and, and this is like. Diane, I, I, I understand. Like, I hear what you were saying. I am not trying to say that you cannot. I'm not trying to deny you that. Like I. And I. I. Want to be like both. You know, we're all partners in this together. You know, we're all partners in this together, and if, you know, we succeed and fail together, so. Rry. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, we can. So, you know, so that said, we. That email. I guess it was very unilateral. It felt very unilateral. I was taken aback. Okay? I was super excited about the safe note and then I was like, whoa, this is all stuff that how the monies get to gets distributed when it gets paid to us, where it goes, what is done with it, what our compensation is, all those things that. I just. I did not think that we had agreed on any of those things. And I have not expressed that it is. Timing is of the essence to me. I feel like I have. I mean. Right. You guys know my personal situation. I'm right. So I feel like I have expressed that the money is needed sooner than later, for me, at least personally. Yeah, I'll pitch in a bit here. Firstly, I'll thank you, Drew, for taking this hard conversation. This is definitely not, you know, something that we can talk easily about. And just to echo what Drew was saying, I was bit confused that day, too, when I read the email. Like they are paying on monthly basis. I don't know why they are paying on monthly basis. So I was also a bit confused. And then it was going to your account and instead of InnVestAI. So that was adding to more confusion. So I'm all in. Okay. You must be paid like you must be paid what you need right now. And, you know, if it was from my personal account, I would be very willing to do that as well. So. I mean, if there's a voting. My voting is for you to get paid that money. You need it. We need you. And whatever you need, we must support that. So I support you on that fully. But yeah, we must follow certain process and, you know, whatever questions we have, I think you are the only one who can answer that. Like, why are they paying on monthly basis? I'm not sure why. They just pay full amount and put it on InnVestAI account. Because we don't have an InnVestAI account yet. We don't even have an LLC agreement yet. I don't know. Yeah. Down the line, right? One month or something. So probably first one month they can pay in your account. The rest of the money will invest. That's what I was trying to say, is until we have a bank account, then I need this money. Howard could use this money. We could use some of it to pay the legal. Fees. I mean, I'm just trying to come up with a stopgap situation. Yeah, I'm. I'm completely. My vote is for you getting paid. Howard getting paid. That's not an issue for me personally, but, yeah, there are certain question and process I think that we must follow. Yeah. And I think, Diane, no one is like we. You have expressed this. We know that it is urgent. Timing is of the essence. They get again, the point is this is that it was just. These were things that should have been discussed. Like these were. It was all. And I'll just say I really did think we had an understanding in your budget. 8,500amonth came to me. 2,000 I originally proposed. It was 4,000 or 4,500, something like that, to Howard. Howard said he would be willing to only take 2000 of it. I thought we had come to agreement in your budget on the economic split. You were the one that did your budget by month, right? I don't think that. I mean, and I have to jump in eight minutes, so I don't want to get too in the weeds here. I mean, it is a safe note, but again, I don't have a bank account for them to deposit this into that says InnVestAI right now. Right. And then you just stop. Gap solution. So that's what I was proposing. And I'm sorry if my language seemed out of the blue for everyone. I'm a 12,500. I think we can manage in company's account. I don't think that's should be a big challenge. Drew. From whatever we can, we can get. Big amount. It's not millions, right? This 12,500, we should be able to manage. And then whatever you need, like you take this month, but probably next year could go directly. Into InnVestAI, and probably that's where we follow the process. If we have a bank account. And I really think that we may be ignoring some issues in the LLC that are going to be difficult and they may not get solved for us in 10 days. I mean, the LLC agreement has been out there. I generated it to the team before Labor Day, so. And I just, I feel like maybe there's some conversations brewing between Drew, you and Mark about this, that when it comes down to, and we really start to talk about it, there could be some real disagreement again around, like, who's contributing what when you know, all of it. Because if you and Mark, at the end of the day, are only going to be able to contribute part time or less than part time work then. And Howard and Benoit and I all intend. I'm. Diane, I just need to. I'm going to tell you, I feel honestly a little insulted that you're going down the road of saying that the work that I have contributed. It doesn't matter how many hours I have put in. And I think same for Vinod. And I don't care how many hours you guys are working. It doesn't matter. I am fully aware that the value I am bringing here is extremely important. And Vinod is another who is. I know is not working full time yet the work he is doing is invaluable to this company. So I just don't think. I know. I understand. You're taught, like, because we've talked about it before. Full time, part time. And how does that factor into investing and compensation, all of that. I cannot imagine how that factors in here. Howard, do you want to jump in? Because I know you have had some thoughts on this in the past. And again, I have five minutes, so I don't have five. I think we should just close the important discussion about whatever check and all that. Can we close that? Whatever 12,500, whatever money that I need. Let's close on that. Probably part time, full time. We can do this. We can discuss some other time.

### You (2025-11-11T22:55:02.379Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:55:21.195Z)

I mean, yeah, we. I will ask my attorney. About? Where I guess I'll have to get introduced to an accountant or a tax attorney or something like that that can tell us whether it is. I can handle that. I have found someone who I think could potentially be a fractional CFO for us. And I was going to introduce him to the team in December, but let me reach out to him and ask him some questions about that. And I'll introduce you all to him was my son, anyway. His name is mike sca. Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T22:56:09.019Z)

So let me just really quickly before Diane be.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:56:09.195Z)

I mean, go ahead.

### You (2025-11-11T22:56:14.139Z)

Ause she asked me to explain. What we were talking about in terms of part time and full time have nothing to do with equity. Just not any changes in the equity. It was really related to the salary. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:56:29.515Z)

Yeah, and I am talking about the salary. I am talking about the compensation. I mean. Is the work. Whether, you know, I don't know how many hours of node's been working. But, you know, and neither he nor I are working full time, obviously, because we both have other jobs. Does that, are you? I mean, I feel like the road you're going down is that the work we're doing is only worth part time. Because of the hours. The hours it takes for us to do it or the hours in which we do it.

### You (2025-11-11T22:56:57.979Z)

Yeah. See, I separate the salary portion from the equity portion, and I view the equity as being related to what we contribute. We're not being paid by the hour. Salary would be just like any other job, right? If you've got one person who is working full time and another person who's working less than full time, that person that's working less than full time wouldn't draw the same salary. But doesn't. To me, that doesn't. Correlate. To the value of what you're contributing. That goes to the 20% where we've already agreed that all of us. Have. A lot to contribute. In specific areas. Together. We make up the team. I think what we've also discussed, at least that I've brought up in the past. Would. Know. As things progress. If maybe. We merge. Industrial and hotel bis or if there's something. Where you would be devoted. To this as a full time job, then I think the salary should reflect that. So I think we're just coming at it from two different ways. Like I said, I'm placing the value that we. Provide. To the company. Is. What determin. Es the equity. Not. The hours that are being put into it. In terms of salary.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:58:35.595Z)

I mean. Yeah. I understand what you're saying. I don't. I just don't know if. I mean, again, we have to. Compensation has to be right, like. A four out of the five of us have to agree is some kind of compensation plan. Some kind of and that there's an exhibit in the LLC that I sent out that has. Base, you know, assumed base pay amounts for each of us. So, I mean, we don't have time right now, but. At the next opportunity. We just need to agree to that.

### You (2025-11-11T22:59:16.939Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:59:17.995Z)

Or, you know, make proposals as to. What that's going to be. And that gets put in that. That is, I think, one of the biggest outstanding items in the LLC agreement.

### You (2025-11-11T22:59:34.059Z)

That's. Sir.

### Guest (2025-11-11T22:59:37.755Z)

All right, gentlemen, have a great night. Talk to you later. Ok? All. Right. I mean. All right, well, we can. I guess we need to talk more about that right now. On the product side, I haven't had a chance to get into today or yesterday, I don't think, but any. Major changes or updates. That I should be looking for. So yeah, we have picked a few items from the list you had created there in progress. And then I think ui, ui x and map. That's almost completed. Yeah, that is really all. Then that year zero. That's going to take a little time because we have to process the monthly data instead of year for that. So that's in progress as well. All right. Let's look in here.

### You (2025-11-11T23:00:43.579Z)

The staging environment hasn't real change. Couple changes that were made last week, but I think. The node. You mentioned that hopefully, maybe. This week. We'll get the UI changes and some of the other stuff ready.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:01:01.115Z)

And all push to this stage. Yeah, I was going to go through and do. Actual projections to see if these calculations. How they work, which I have not a chance to do yet, but I'll try to do today or tomorrow. Year zero. The Howard. You send me something on. The. Thing. Interest. The interest expense piece. So you send me something. What I remember is send you lender. Dashboard thing. Yeah. All right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:02:13.179Z)

Yeah. You don't have to put in the inputs in here. You can just advance the screen. This is based on the list that Mark sent in Excel. And I think I mentioned in my email, if you use the back button on the left, go back to the first screen. The only thing done here is I did add. The census id or the sar id on here. So just like we do on the investment side. And then. Your built in year renovated. Seemed like it made more sense to be lump. Ed in with the property information. So then you can go ahead and click on the next there. And. This would be the loan details. Now, Mark didn't have anything about a loan number, but. When I saw that that was not included, I thought, that's something. If I'm a lender and I'm evaluating this, I need to know which loan I'm doing. So I don't know if it's going to be loan number. Loan id, but we can change that. And then following that is the borrower information and then like the brand and management. So this is more.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:03:29.515Z)

Yeah, I wonder. I mean. I think. I've been trying to think about how this is right, like an initial. Loan or deal or property that somebody is working on won't have any. You know, like you're going to go look for a loan, you're going to. Go.

### You (2025-11-11T23:03:50.379Z)

Remember, this is Solo Lender. Not the investors.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:03:52.475Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:03:53.899Z)

Yeah. So this is for the reminder. Service. R The first group of people that were going to.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:05.835Z)

So. Wait, say that last part again. This is for the.

### You (2025-11-11T23:04:09.419Z)

This is for the lenders. To track their properties, where we do the monthly uploads. So this will be a situation where the loan already exists.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:16.875Z)

Right. Right. Right. Yeah, okay. Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T23:04:21.339Z)

This might be a valuation. For creating. A new loan.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:26.315Z)

Right. Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T23:04:34.459Z)

So for next, what if take a look at it from that standpoint for a lender who is looking to either.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:34.475Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:04:43.179Z)

Basically monitor the loan throughout the life cycle. Monthly loans, making sure that service coverage, yield management, all that stuff.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:47.275Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:04:53.019Z)

Is compliant with the loan documents.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:04:58.955Z)

Yeah. Let me go. You say this includes. So I think these. I don't know. I think recourse is a yes or no prepayment. Yes or no? Yield maintenance. Oh, yeah. You have it in here? Dcr, debt, yield. Okay, Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:05:23.899Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah, so I didn't make it an input. Like what? Yield, maintenance is your requirements, because I got some of that up above. So basically, I know Recourse has some pretty intensive language. In a loan. And I didn't want to have to copy a large. Paragraph and paste it in here. So it was basically just a yes. No. Is there a recourse? Yes or no? Do they have this loan? Allow for prepayment? Yes or no? Not the prepayment conditions.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:05:58.795Z)

I think that's.

### You (2025-11-11T23:05:59.819Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:06:00.875Z)

I think that's sufficient for. For now, I mean.

### You (2025-11-11T23:06:01.019Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:06:03.915Z)

Yeah, Ultimately we would, you know, somebody would be loading a loan document and then it would just pull that information. But I think. One item that's not in here, that was in the other one, is interest only terms.

### You (2025-11-11T23:06:16.299Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:06:16.475Z)

Interest. You know, months or years of interest only.

### You (2025-11-11T23:06:18.939Z)

Yeah. Yeah, at the amortization and not the reserve, okay? That's an easy app.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:06:24.395Z)

Yeah. So just, you know, if it's interest rate is whatever. Actually, you know what else? And I don't even know if this was in the original one, but interest rate is, you know, most of these loans are floating rate interest. So if we do. Floating rate. You know, like, is the loan floating or fixed? If it's fixed, you know, then it's going to be, you know, 5%. But if it's floating.

### You (2025-11-11T23:06:46.939Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:06:51.515Z)

Generally they're above. So for sofr s o f r I don't know, it's like some. I don't even know what it is, but it's a. You know, it's like Libor. It's like an inner bank exchange rate. So it's, you know, how many. Points above. So for.

### You (2025-11-11T23:07:02.299Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:07:05.915Z)

Is the loan. I don't. So that that would probably need to be a checkbox here, like, loan amount. You know, and then is it fixed rate or floating rate? And then. Interest rate. Term interest only. Term interest only. Years or periods and then amortization. I think that would cover and I don't know if this reserve requirement.

### You (2025-11-11T23:07:37.899Z)

I thought about that. I don't know why it's in there. But Mark had it on his spreadsheet.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:08:07.675Z)

Oh, this is. This would be like a percentage of revenue. So. In hotel management agreements.

### You (2025-11-11T23:08:15.579Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:08:15.835Z)

Like hotels always have to, you know, you have to contribute a certain percentage of your revenue towards your FF and E reserve, which is just like an escrow account that you can't touch. So usually the brand franchise agreement requires a certain percentage, and then the hotel management agreement with the operator requires it be a certain percentage. Usually it's like 4 or 5%. So usually they're all going to say, and then, you know, 4%, 5%. But oftentimes the lender. Agreement also has a certain requirement. It has to be 5% or 4%. And so when you're, when they're, when the operator is doing their books, they're just going to take whichever one's the highest. Did the lender require 5%? The brand required 5% and the operator required 4. Percent. They're going to take 5%.

### You (2025-11-11T23:08:49.979Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:01.595Z)

Maybe the. You know. So it's just. It just. Yeah, it just needs to be a percentage of revenue.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:05.739Z)

Okay. Yeah, we. We have that the same way in the existing model. Yeah, I didn't know if that was just a set aside that they had, you know, they could set a draw. Down on it or if it was a monthly percentage.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:23.595Z)

Yeah, it's just the percentage.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:29.739Z)

All right. That's an easy tape.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:30.395Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:30.939Z)

As well.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:34.475Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:35.179Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:36.795Z)

All right. I think those look good. I'll try to get in and test the. The actual underwriting projection piece. Tonight or tomorrow.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:46.619Z)

All right. Anything else?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:47.435Z)

All right. Do you want it to Discuss something, I believe. Howard, you want to discuss something?

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:55.259Z)

With you.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:56.875Z)

No, no. Here. Right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:09:58.299Z)

Yeah. No, I just wanted you and you and your to say on so we could continue the discussion and talk about.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:09:59.275Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T23:10:06.459Z)

The. Concerns on. The llc and the salary. And everything. Unless there's anything else to bring up, we can. Meet again on Thursday.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:10:19.675Z)

I mean, we. I. Regarding the llc. That. We can get a bank account open in a, like, a couple days. I. 'm. I mean. Personally, but I say also, like, professionally, like, it makes me very uncomfortable to think that Drift was going to just send the money to Diane and then.

### You (2025-11-11T23:10:48.379Z)

I. Understand. Yeah, Yeah. I don't disagree. It's not business as usual. But one of the things that I, Diane and I did talk about, not the LLC specifically, but her concerns about, you know, why did she input all these things? And she made the comment that. We just thought that the original was a cookie cutter. Pretty lightweight llc, and she wanted to account for every possible situation that we as founders might encounter. And I. I just told her straight up, we can't do that. Nobody's going to be able to predict. Exactly what's going to happen. And I explained to her that's where the supermajority and majority comes in. We don't have to account for everything. We can always deal with it as it comes up. With a vote. That. What we really need to do is agree only on what needs the supermajority. Which then needs everything else. Would be a majority. We don't have to have a bullet point list on what each one is. So I think. After I explained it to her, she understood and she agrees. So, you know, when we take a look at what some of her changes are, you know, I don't think we have to. Have that level of detail that she was looking for, I think. Hopefully I was able to explain it to her in a way that. You know, I think she was just really trying so hard. To come up with an agreement that just covered. Everything. And then what else? We talked about the equity, and she made a comment how Mark. And yourself. And I told her that I felt the same way as. Well, you know, we don't want to dilute any more than we have to. And so one of the things that I've been looking into is how do we handle. Equity. For. Non founders. And one of the things I was going to propose is that we actually have three separate pools. One pool for employees. So the developers, everybody else, and typically that's like 0.2 to 0.5%. It's a relatively small amount of equity, but this is something that they get to be early employees. Then we need a separate pool for key employees.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:13:31.755Z)

You mean like per employee? Yeah. I mean, that's. We do. I mean, obviously, it depends on.

### You (2025-11-11T23:13:35.659Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:13:39.755Z)

Reset aside 10% for that, which I think was something we talked about in the past.

### You (2025-11-11T23:13:46.859Z)

There will be a pool of 10% equity. Of which send these employees would like it. 0.2 or 0.5. So. Theoretically, if we had 10%, if we wanted to give 0.5, then our first 20 employees would be eligible for that. But more importantly is the key employ. Ees. We're going to need somebody to lead the sales. We're going to have some fractional employees, like a cfo. That we've talked about. Key employees that we're not going to be able to afford salaries. So in lieu of the big salary, you give them a bigger chunk, they might get 3 or 5% each. Right, so. We need the pool where they can get larger amounts. And then. Whatever left or. The equity. Investors for the safe notes for everything else. And I even mentioned that I think that the money that you and Mark. Have contributed. Would go into that third pool where you would get equity. On the. Investment portion. Pro rata based on whatever was contributed. That it does not affect the 20% ownership equity. So that 20%, say 20%. Regardless. Of who contributes what.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:15:14.155Z)

Well, we're already not at, like. I mean, these. All these things have to total to 100, so. You know, if we leave a pool of 10% to be retained by the company for options for, for, for employees. Then we each, you know, the remaining amount as we own 18%.

### You (2025-11-11T23:15:28.939Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:15:32.075Z)

If we want.

### You (2025-11-11T23:15:32.699Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:15:33.835Z)

To.

### You (2025-11-11T23:15:34.219Z)

We're saying same thing. OK? I'm just saying we all get 20% of the owner, whatever's left of the owner.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:15:41.915Z)

Whatever's left.

### You (2025-11-11T23:15:43.339Z)

Yes. So you have 100%. You subtract 10% for employees, 10% for key employees. Whatever equity takes up and then whatever's left, we split equally. That's what I mean when I say 20%. I understand what you're doing there, so, yeah. It's fine. If you take a look at the total piece of the pie gets smaller and smaller.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:16:14.075Z)

Yeah. I mean, it could be. It could be.

### You (2025-11-11T23:16:14.219Z)

So those are the.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:16:17.355Z)

It could be 15, 30, 45, you know, 60, 75, and 25, you know, and then 15. I mean, whatever, like. I mean, I. I think, like. However much we set aside. For this for, you know, the company owned, company retained. I would imagine we are going to. Exceed like? I. I don't know. I guess. I feel like it's. It's hard to know whether or not. Like, we have no way of knowing whether we're going to exceed that.

### You (2025-11-11T23:17:00.939Z)

No. We don't.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:17:01.275Z)

Or not.

### You (2025-11-11T23:17:01.819Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:17:02.475Z)

And.

### You (2025-11-11T23:17:03.819Z)

At some point need to add more to one of those three pools. But what we talked about. When we talk about majority of supermajority, I think that's really. That's kind of where it boils down to. And does the llc specify. That the vote is for each person. Not the amount of equity that they have. And.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:17:35.995Z)

It's just for the person. Yeah. Just by. There are five founding members. We each have a vote. Sort of like that. We were like a board, basically, and five members and a board.

### You (2025-11-11T23:17:45.339Z)

So I think it's at that point it's a non issue. So how we do the math, whether we do it the way you've got it lined out here or whether we create three pools, at the end of the day, it's all the same dollars. So. However, the llc has it in there. We can do it. And I mentioned to Diane, too, it's like we can't get the perfect llc. On day one. We're always going to come up against something that needs to be changed, and we just simply follow the rules and vote on it. And she would have said at the end of the conversation. I just think she's just really trying to come up with a one size fits all LLC that will account for every possible scenario. I just had to. Just. Be like, calmly explain to her. What? That really comes out to be. So I think she's good on that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:18:40.155Z)

Yeah. Okay, well, if we can get. I mean, again, like. I mean, the other thing is, is. The compensation piece. If we're gonna. If this is gonna be before 11, 20, 26. Then, you know, we. We need that. There's gonna be tax implications. And we need. We need to a tax person sooner rather than later.

### You (2025-11-11T23:19:03.179Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:19:08.315Z)

The other alternative is. That I believe if the company has a bank account. And the 75,000 is deposited. We can, you know. Some amount can be loaned to her and you. For two months, three months until this. Date arrives. And then you can, you know, each of you can receive compensation. And pay back the loan. And it could be, you know, you could even. We could even say that there's a first month. Distribution or first month additional compensation. To cover that loan amount or something like that. But that's just to avoid having to do the taxes.

### You (2025-11-11T23:20:00.379Z)

Thing I mentioned to her is I appreciate that she puts something in there, but really, with this first fund coming in, all I ask for is to be reimbursed for my out of pocket. I don't really care about betting. I've got all the receipts. Of everything that's been spent. It's now closer to 900. Last time it was just a little below 700.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:20:26.795Z)

Yeah, believe me, I agree. I'm at like 4 or 5,000 at this point, so I'm.

### You (2025-11-11T23:20:35.259Z)

Those of us who have contributed financially rather than being. A. Salary or loan. Or whatever. The receipts and get reimbursed.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:20:47.435Z)

But I think it also, I mean. The note. I know we. We. We never did the allocation of, you know what. What? Where the money goes, what's the priority? But I know that. There are, like, Benoit being, you know, one of the priorities, obviously, and the developers in India being another. Right. Like, you know, we know you've expressed multiple times that they need to get paid more. You know, asap.

### You (2025-11-11T23:21:17.179Z)

Set up. We can have that basically set up to. Be. At the very beginning transferred automatically.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:21:23.195Z)

Y. Eah. Y.

### You (2025-11-11T23:21:26.779Z)

Don't have to worry about that, but I don't even know. It's also been working on getting some local representation and getting benefits and some other things.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:21:26.875Z)

Eah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:21:35.099Z)

That they would administer, so it'll probably take us a while to get that set up. Right off the. Bat. At least we can just create an automated transfer. At least I get the money. On the day that they. Want. I think that will be a good. Step forward for them.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:21:53.915Z)

All right. Well. I mean, I guess. You talked to Diane. Did she agree that the llc, like, are there? She says she. She makes it sound like she still wants to review it. Is that the case? Is there still a lot more to discuss here? Again. It sounds like you guys. You and her have talked about it already, so.

### You (2025-11-11T23:22:10.779Z)

I don't think so. I don't think there's a whole lot to discuss. I do think she is concerned about the salary portion, as am I. Because even based on. Your. Comment about. What? Each one is worth. I take a look at that and I think, okay, well. That means my contributions aren't worth very much if I've been putting in full time hours but still get paid same as everybody else. Right. So it kind of goes both ways. Whether I think we need to take a deep breath. And see. If there's an equitable way to approach that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:22:59.595Z)

Yeah. I mean. If we. If each of us was not doing the work we are doing now, regardless of how many hours it takes. What would it cost to hire somebody to do it? That, I mean. I mean, I do. I mean, I think I was the one that initially said that there's a difference between your, you know, compensation versus equity. You know, and that was something one of my business. I mean, I've heard a book going both ways, and I honestly don't. Know which makes more sense. But at the end of the day, if you are a founder, You have equity. And that obviously does make things different. In some ways, you know, however, like. If, if, if, if. Whether or not I have equity or, you know, any of us in equity, if we weren't doing the role that we're doing, we'd have to hire somebody, and that would cost. I mean, I guess it's like. I would cost a certain, you know, however, whatever it would cost, and we, you know, that that person would not have equity. On the other hand, like. We're all gonna be contributing. Like. Like, we're all gonna be like, we all have the same amount of equity, basically, right? So, like, it is. It's. It's tough. It's. It's a tough pill to swallow that. Some of us are getting, getting paid. And some of us would get compensation in. Some wouldn't. Right. Like, it's. I. It's sort of needs to be all or nothing, like. Right, like, because again, if somebody's gonna do the work that I'm gonna. That I'm doing right now, Or if somebody's gonna do the work that you're doing right now. Like we. We would have to hire somebody to do that. You know, but we both have the same amount of equity, so it's like. It seems like. It's just. I can't imagine a way we're all gonna agree if it's not all or nothing. Even if the money amount is not paid up front. Even if it is, you know, take it in.

### You (2025-11-11T23:25:03.979Z)

Ok?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:25:10.475Z)

Accrual right in lieu of payment, but. All right, well. I will try to. I guess Diane's gonna get. Feedback from an accountant. But if, if, if there are not any huge. If there, if we can get the LLC agreement done. We can open a bank account probably next week.

### You (2025-11-11T23:25:34.219Z)

You made a comment about losing your lawyer, who would be wrapping up the changes.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:25:40.475Z)

Oh. No, no, no, no. I do. I didn't say losing. I meant using. I have my lawyer.

### You (2025-11-11T23:25:46.459Z)

I misunderstood.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:25:46.475Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. So. I can. I mean, if there's nothing if. If we're all agreed on the rest of the. On the llc. I mean, there are questions that I had. Right. Like, does Vinod need to be assigned as a manager versus member? I think that is one. You know, I don't see any personal need for. Vesting of founder founding members.

### You (2025-11-11T23:26:03.659Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:26:11.595Z)

Vesting for new members, sure, but that can be done in a side letter that doesn't need to be in the llc.

### You (2025-11-11T23:26:17.419Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:26:19.915Z)

So. I mean, I can't remember what the other ones were, but. If we can get agreement on those, we can get, you know, again, we can do this. You know, and I want to be cognizant and, you know, empathetic to Diane.

### You (2025-11-11T23:26:34.219Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:26:34.955Z)

Obviously, it is also, you know, it's also a business. I don't want to get penalized with fines or extra taxes or anything like that. You know, in six months, if we did something incorrectly,

### You (2025-11-11T23:26:45.339Z)

I agree. I agree. With that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:26:46.475Z)

It's. It's all. And especially for, you know, Lark and me, it's like we know driftwood too, and our reputations are equally on the line. So.

### You (2025-11-11T23:26:58.619Z)

Ok? That makes sense. Yeah. I just almost feel like we just need to identify the specific items that are in question and. This is. Knock it out. Let's just get it done.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:27:12.795Z)

I feel like it's compensation, and I feel like we have beat that dead horse. I don't. I. So, like, I am trying to address what Diane has expressed as her concern, like she needs money.

### You (2025-11-11T23:27:17.419Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:27:23.915Z)

And, like, awesome. I. We have talked about that at length. I think it's been addressed. She just still seems very. I don't know what the attention. I don't know what the remaining issue is. Beyond that.

### You (2025-11-11T23:27:34.059Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:27:35.195Z)

Dirk, tell me one thing. What if we just take this LLC as a sign and open a bank account? And then if needed, we modify it. Right? Just to open the bank account. What if we sign? We could do that. The only thing.

### You (2025-11-11T23:27:50.779Z)

We could do it.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:27:54.395Z)

We have to agree. And right now, Diane does not agree. We don't have to agree because we can modify that right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:27:57.019Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:28:02.075Z)

That's we can.

### You (2025-11-11T23:28:04.459Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what I told Diane earlier, is that we don't have to have the perfect LLC on day one.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:28:05.035Z)

That's true.

### You (2025-11-11T23:28:12.299Z)

Can always modify it. But again, that just kind of goes back to making sure we have. A. I think we absolutely have to agree on the super majority. If. There's no objections to what requires the super majority work, then everything else falls into place.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:28:31.195Z)

You would write down. It seems like there's a blocker because of the bank account. Right. If we have bank account, then drift would kind of transfer the money to bank account. And then if Diane wants to loan or we want to loan some amount to die, and then that makes it easier, right?

### You (2025-11-11T23:28:47.579Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think it would.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:28:50.075Z)

Yeah, I mean, it's listed right here in the summary. Like major decisions requiring a supermajority amender amend agreement or issue new equity a bit new members borrow a lend over 5,000, enter major transactions over 5,000, initiate litigation, mergers and solutions dealing with members or affiliates. I mean, majority is four votes out of five, right? Yeah, four out of five. Everything else would just be a majority. So. Yeah. And what is majority? Three. Three out of three? Out of five. Okay. Yeah. So who is disagreeing on that? That's.

### You (2025-11-11T23:29:23.979Z)

Nobody of the definition of the supermajority. We just need to know what needs the supermajority vote, because basically that means anything that doesn't require supermajority. Just needs three out of five. To. Make the changes, whatever's being discussed.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:29:43.195Z)

Yeah, and I think we did agree, you know, like, I. I took these things more or less from Diane's original agreement. And then the only other thing after that was. Compensation. And right. Like I put. The. This compensation can be whatever. Like I. It doesn't really matter. And it does. But like, it can be whatever at this point, if I mean, but we do all have to agree on what our sort of. I mean, if we were to hire somebody in our place, what would it cost? Yeah. And please do one thing. Just replace that. We know that Sonia in well, that's. I did put. I did put her. In the. She's in the member schedule, which is our capital contributions, I think. What I'm gonna suggest, maybe ask my attorney, is that. Like. You are still gonna be the person that does the work, and you're gonna. You just might be assigned as a manager. Which basically means, like, you're an officer of the company. Which is a sort of like your role, separate from the. Separate from being, you know, your wife will be the member, which is like the equity owner, and you'll be the manager assigned to do the work. So your name will still be here. I think we just might change this to manage your compensation plan. And then we. All get assigned as managers, except for your wife, who does not. And you are assigned a manager. That's just so. It's. Yeah, but I do have that in here. The fact that you're. Your wife is going to be the. The owner, technically. Yeah. Cool. Cool. As far as my name is. Yeah. Cool.

### You (2025-11-11T23:31:21.259Z)

So that reminds me. We. Diane and I did talk about this because when we were talking about the supermajority and the majority, she thought to say, okay, well, what if one of us sits it by a bus? And there's only four left. If. The person who gets hit by the bus. Would we in advance identify in the Senegal? If the recipient. Isn't a voting member, they might get our 20%. But they don't get.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:31:55.835Z)

They do get the 20% if. If I get hit by. Yeah, they don't get to vote, though. If I get hit by, I am the member. Like, I have voting rights. And that is separate from my equity.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:06.379Z)

It.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:08.635Z)

If, you know, like, if I get hit by a bus, my equity ownership, like, the. The value of that and the shares go to my wife, but my wife has no voting.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:09.259Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:20.475Z)

Rights. So, you know.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:22.539Z)

That's. That's where the confusion comes in. Because then all of a sudden, you've got an even number. Of people. And getting a majority would be more difficult. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:33.355Z)

I mean.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:33.659Z)

So then having three out of five, now you need three out of four.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:37.755Z)

Yeah. I mean, then it's super majority and majority become the same thing. And if you can't. If you can't break the deadlock, you go to arbitration.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:46.539Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:46.875Z)

I mean.

### You (2025-11-11T23:32:48.139Z)

Remember the opportunity, being in there.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:32:51.755Z)

That's just like. I mean, you can admit. You could admit somebody else. Like we could put some other language in there for tiebreakers, but, I mean. For better or worse. When Diane came to us, she, you know, gave us all. Equal shares and equal rights. And, you know, if she had come in and, you know, said, I'm gonna be the, you know, I'm gonna be the only board member, that would have been a different story. But that's. We're not. That. That ship has sailed.

### You (2025-11-11T23:33:12.699Z)

Right. Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:33:27.755Z)

Probably the next step. Can we kind of send an email, ask everyone to sign and say that, you know, we'll modify whatever is required, but to open the bank account, we need this. And then probably kind of. Do you want to vote to loan the money or if she really. It feels like she really needs it. Yeah. And I. I'm sympathetic to that. So I'm. If the money were in the bank account today, I would say. I mean, she has been resistant to. To a loan. She doesn't want it to be alone. Because she had bad experiences with that in a past company, which I can also understand. So you know that. But we can try to. I can. I don't think it's that like. I can. We can probably get W2 set up. In gusto in a couple of days. Why not? Why not loan, right? Because we are not paying salary to anyone this so it's a loan. Yeah, that. That's what my attorney suggested. She didn't like an idea. Which. What's. What's wrong with that? Well, loans have to be paid back. Of course. Yeah, that was the thing. She's like.

### You (2025-11-11T23:34:34.139Z)

They do have to be paid back or if. We declare. Distributions. You just subtract whatever the loan amount was. So, you know, if we do a 10,000 distribution, we subtract 8,500 and she gets $1,500 in the bank, right?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:34:43.355Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, anybody taking money from company's account, they have to give it back. That's. Yeah. That's like. It's not a donation. Yeah, exactly. I just. She just. She doesn't. You know, she didn't have. She's like, if I get paid. I think if she gets paid. Whatever. 8,500 right now. She's going to get spent immediately, and then she's not going to have anything to pay it back with. When the time to pay it back comes that we can. We can account for that. Some other mechanism. But, like.

### You (2025-11-11T23:35:18.699Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:35:21.195Z)

Alone is just an easier if you just call something alone, even if it's interest free and never gets paid back, it's just has different tax implications than if it's a distribution or a compensation or a paycheck. That just is what it is. So if we can get her to agree to. To that, then we can. You know, we can do this tomorrow. So Howard is something. She didn't have any. I mean, it sounded like she had objections when we talk just now, but I don't know how much she's actually looked over this document.

### You (2025-11-11T23:35:57.259Z)

I don't know. I didn't. Ask her. How much she reviewed it, but we just kind of talked about those. Points of feeds.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:36:06.555Z)

I would propose you recommend this if you agree. With the sign to this. Open a bank account, loan the money to dine and you know, we are sorted for now.

### You (2025-11-11T23:36:17.419Z)

Done.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:36:17.675Z)

Then we don't have a deadline.

### You (2025-11-11T23:36:19.419Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:36:20.475Z)

Yeah. If you could please write that email, propose this solution and, you know, let. Hopefully Mark would agree to. We haven't asked Marble. Let's see. Yeah, I mean,

### You (2025-11-11T23:36:30.379Z)

I mean, that's the thing. It's like. I don't know Diane that well, right? I've only known her for the starting year, but she seems like a person who. Really? Light pushback on something like this because I can see her saying, Well, how do I know you guys are going to agree or redo me?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:37:00.155Z)

We got some trust, right? Yeah. Yes. Yes, there are. Yeah. I mean, you don't. She doesn't, but she has to have some trust that we're going to.

### You (2025-11-11T23:37:01.899Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:37:08.555Z)

So, I mean, that's. That's. That's. Yeah, I agree. I think. I think letting go of losing control has been a challenge for her, which I can. I can understand.

### You (2025-11-11T23:37:20.859Z)

You're right. She made at the very beginning on how it was set up. And I think. It's, you know. Because she. Feels like she wanted to be fair to everybody. So everybody should be equal. But. Didn't really. Consider. Somebody, potentially a few at that time.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:37:41.915Z)

Yeah. All right. Well, so, Howard, you'll. You'll. You'll follow up with her?

### You (2025-11-11T23:37:48.459Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I can. I can sound out an email and let her know what we discuss about the. Executing the. Llc right away. Get the bank set up. And then go back and. Revise. The llc.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:38:01.035Z)

Bank setup and loan are the amount whatever she needs. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:38:05.899Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:38:06.155Z)

All right, I will. And I'll have to. I'll talk to mark. And try to get, I think, you know, get him on board with that. Is it, Howard? Is it you? Would you want to do the same? Or is it. Is it. If we start, you know. If we have more, okay?

### You (2025-11-11T23:38:22.619Z)

No. No. I'm fine. Like I said. I'll just wait. And then just. Get reimbursed.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:38:30.635Z)

Well, reimbursements can come sooner, like any reimbursements. That can come immediately. That doesn't need to be. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:38:37.179Z)

That's my immediate concern.

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:38:40.875Z)

Okay? All right. Let's get rid of this deadlock. And yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T23:38:48.939Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T23:38:50.075Z)

All right. All right. Thanks, guys. All right.

### You (2025-11-11T23:38:54.219Z)

Thanks.
