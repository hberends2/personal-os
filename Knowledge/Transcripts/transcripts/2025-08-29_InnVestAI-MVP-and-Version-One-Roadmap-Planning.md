# Transcript for: InnVestAI MVP and Version One Roadmap Planning

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:45:52.903Z)

As I told you in the last, last meeting, right? There's a housewarming, my friend, so that is done.

### You (2025-08-29T17:45:59.625Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:46:00.983Z)

Helping them out. From mom for a few days.

### You (2025-08-29T17:46:10.425Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:46:12.023Z)

That is Tuesday went off is Monday and Wednesday. So, yeah, I'm here in New Jersey working and trying to help these guys. Sometimes just moved few mattresses, bits downstairs. Now he's gonna get a U Haul, then we'll load everything. It's close by. It's like 10 minutes from. Old house to new house. Yeah. Are you excited about six month news that Diane was giving yesterday?

### You (2025-08-29T17:46:45.945Z)

We had a really good call. Really good call. He actually does have. I mean, he is an attorney right now, but he actually started working for IBM. And so he says he doesn't really do much coding. He's got a little bit of coding background, but he was basically very similar to product manager back then. But then he switched careers, went into law school at night. So it's not like he's unfamiliar with software. It's good, yeah. He's very excited. We talked about long term plans. Talked about how we plan on rolling out to a closed beta group and then going from there. He's definitely going to write a check. We have to determine an initial valuation. Which is something I've never done, but I'm assuming Mark and Drew have experience in it since Mark has invested. And Drew has been trying to get some investors, so they must have some experience in valuation, so we'll see what they come up with.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:48:13.943Z)

What about that six month thing Diane was talking about? Like the idea of starting with that. If at all that happens. Diane was saying that you and me probably could come full time for six months. To start with.

### You (2025-08-29T17:48:32.585Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. I took that as good news because she said Mark is now on board with starting to get early stage investors. And not waiting for version one. Which he was before. He wanted to have something that was more complete. So the idea is that sometime after we at least have the MVP out there and go get some beta testers, that maybe in the next three to six months we could get enough. Money coming in so that you and I can draw a salary. So yeah. That's good news, because we got two people now. And then Diane also told me she had a conversation yesterday afternoon with one of her friends and she wants to get involved. So we've got a lot of people putting in a little bit of money, but not enough to. I mean, we got not enough to really draw a salary on. But today it was brought up he was asking questions about everybody. And Diane mentioned that we are being slowed down by the fact that your full time job and then you're trying to do this evenings and weekends. And she was concerned about burnout. He kind of made the same comment that we need to get enough funding so that you and I can go full time. And everybody else can start getting a salary. When and if needed. Mark will never need a salary. I don't know if Drew will want a salary or not. They may just defer it. Actually, I was kind of surprised, because if you read the LLC agreement, if you defer salary, It earns little over 5% interest, which is way more than you can get in any bank right now.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:50:43.943Z)

Five percent.

### You (2025-08-29T17:50:50.825Z)

So I think. Like Apple Savings has always been one of the best, and that's like 3.65% today. So. Yeah, I mean, they want to defer. Earn some interest on it. That would be great. We can use the money elsewhere.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:51:14.423Z)

Last, Paul Diane was sounding like. Mark and True, and everybody was kind of ready for us to get started very soon.

### You (2025-08-29T17:51:28.745Z)

Well, they are. And that's why I say it's good news now that Mark's not pushing back. That he is willing now to go and start making presentations and asking for checks without having to wait until later. I mean, she's doing a good job 's doing a good job of getting these acquaintances.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:51:48.503Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T17:51:59.385Z)

To write a check. But it's enough to pay subscriptions and back end costs. It's not going to give anybody a salary. But she knows that Mark has got the connections. To the big money. And that anybody's going to be able to bring in enough investment to actually pay a salary to anybody, it's going to be his connections.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:52:25.303Z)

Isn't Mark interested in directly investing?

### You (2025-08-29T17:52:28.665Z)

I don't know. Probably. I don't know what arrangement he Andrew made. I don't know who wrote. The check if it was 5050 or what? But I always kind of thought that he would. Maybe he's just waiting to put his own money in until later. Maybe wants to. Pass the risk off to somebody else first.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:52:56.263Z)

Yeah. All right. Cool. Yeah. Yesterday I was like, so. So. What is a burn? Kind of burnt out. But then I select, so. Well, I selected nine. I probably woke up at seven. And I did some yoga this morning, so I'm really feeling great today. Yeah. Cool. So that six month plan, whatever Diane was asking for. Should we discuss that?

### You (2025-08-29T17:53:31.625Z)

Sure.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:53:34.903Z)

Also on the I don't know whether you heard from organ. I don't think you did. I think he was the VP guy was insisting on on site.

### You (2025-08-29T17:53:42.985Z)

Yeah. No, that's fine.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:53:45.063Z)

So just fine. Yeah. And lately there's been a lot of pressure on Morganto. Initially, there's, like, not that much. Now. I think Shomo is lot of pressure, and he's just putting that down on me.

### You (2025-08-29T17:54:03.545Z)

See, you're going to show off, that's what happens.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:54:06.343Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T17:54:13.865Z)

I appreciate everybody thinking of me and wanting to help me out, but. I kind of got to the point where I just feel like I really need to focus on this. I didn't want to be in the same position that you're in right now. Where you get burned out. And putting in 40 hours or more on a job, and then evenings and weekends on this. I work best when I can work, when I'm ready to work.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:54:48.823Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-29T17:54:49.225Z)

I can't just be forced to sit down at a desk and produce.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:54:54.663Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T17:54:55.465Z)

Whatever I.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:54:56.423Z)

I think in ip, we kind of got used to that a little bit as well. Like, even back in India, we would work long hours. And Berkadia I think it is not that much. But otherwise, it's always been like that. But here, obviously. It's too much. Because we are just getting started, right? Which I'll kind of mentally prepared for as well. And then I kind of balance it out. Something like taking a break. Like yesterday I took a break. Then I feel energized for next one week or then I'm like, okay. Now. I need a break again. But initially, I mean, that's how we have to manage otherwise. It'll be. It will be hard to get anything done.

### You (2025-08-29T17:55:44.585Z)

Yeah. That's true. Got to balance it out. So here we go. Yeah. That's why I started doing this many, many years ago. Like back around 2011, 2012, I worked for a company that was based in Chicago.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:56:14.343Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-29T17:56:17.705Z)

And for the first year and a half, I would drive there on a Monday, spend the entire week at the Embassy Suites, and then come back on the weekend and then redo it like, every year. So I was basically living away from home. But I got to the point where I was able to scale back and not have to go in so often, but what I would do is I work a few hours during the day. But then in the evenings, after the kids went to bed, I'd go downstairs and I'd work till midnight, 1:00. And it's like I could crank out more in those four hours in the evening than I could in a full eight hour day at desk. So I just kind of stopped. Trying to do the whole nine to five thing. And it wasn't until I got back with Red IQ where they were kind of insisting on the whole nine to five office hours. It's like, all right. But before that. Just kind of whenever I felt the creativity bubble up. I'd go and get the work in. But if I look back on it, I was easily still putting in 50, 60 hours. They just weren't all packed. In one day. Like you and I, we trade messages back on the weekends, and it's like, well, that's when I do my best work.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:57:47.223Z)

Yeah. For me. You have an option that your wife works? And income is still getting some income. And for me, my wife doesn't work.

### You (2025-08-29T17:57:56.985Z)

No, I know. I get it. Yeah. It's a different situation.

### Guest (2025-08-29T17:58:00.023Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T17:58:02.425Z)

All right. So I see you're in. So the poc, I think. We have everything on the poc in the prds, so those are just. All the information that's already there. So I think that yellow box we can probably mark as complete. So now we're working on the mvp. So what I tried to do here is just kind of like a pricing matrix. You go back there and you see, oh, what did I get in this next MVP level? Well, it's everything in the POC Plus. And then I added a few other things. So I think, like the account user setup, authentication things you're already working on. And the POC data that I have hard coded becomes fully functional. A limited AI. Those are the things that we're trying to add into the mvp that's over and above the poc. And hopefully I didn't want to get too deep other than just the document processing is AI and then the deal analysis. So then when you go to version one, that's, you know, 60 to 90 days after the MVP is released. So if we. If we go. To our closed beta. Say, the first week of October. Then we're talking January 1st to January 31st for version one. Right. So 60 to 90 days for us to work with the beta testers. Make whatever changes we find that we have to make. If anything's working right, if the workflow doesn't make sense to them. And then we can also work on some of these other things, like some of the additional AI features. And again, this is kind of. I took that list of that document. Here, let me see. I think that is up there just to make sure you've got access to it. I gotta find out which folder I put it in. Yeah, here we go. Then the AI features. Document there. I know you've had access to it before. I think you've actually opened it up, but. I think for version one and then 1.1 and beyond, we just need to go through this document, which I think I've already done on here, because I've got the high impact, high complexity. High impact medium complexity which comes directly from this document. For version 1.1.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:01:51.463Z)

And vp. R trime vp. I see. Phase two. Here in this document? Yes, to their heart. I don't Howard.

### You (2025-08-29T18:02:02.025Z)

Yeah, I think I probably should go through that document and. Change those headings to be like version one, version 1.1. But I think I've got it aligned. So the MVP would be document processing, data extraction of financial analysis or financial statements, and then the AI summary. And then I think version one would be the same as phase two in that document. Which would be like data extraction from an om. The agentic market analysis thing that I put together on that genspark sample. Ongoing development of the equity model. The risk matrix came up in the conversation today that Mike was asking about that. And then I didn't want to put in a specific version. So I'm saying basically version 1.1 is after we start getting version 1 feedback, which would be from external users, not closed beta. That's too far out to really nail down anything other than these high level bullet points.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:03:28.423Z)

So that's six month line. Which would that be? Version one.

### You (2025-08-29T18:03:32.665Z)

Yeah. So let me see after. So. Okay, let's put some time in here. So, let me see. So I would say. Probably the same thing 60 to 90 days after the MVP. So our after version one, I mean.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:04:04.583Z)

One second. In this. We are talking about when you and me are working full time, right?

### You (2025-08-29T18:04:12.345Z)

Yes. Yeah. We can't get this. We won't get this far. In this timeline if you're still part time. I mean, to me, I'm a full time employee. I'm working on it full time. I'm just not getting paid. But, yeah, you're not.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:04:30.823Z)

For me, I would say that more than full time because I'm kind of dealing with these guys during daytime.

### You (2025-08-29T18:04:36.665Z)

Y eah. No, I know, I know.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:04:36.823Z)

Then I'm reviewing the quality of work or the productivity might not be that high, because obviously you're not that focused. But, yeah, kind of there also in seven days. Completion of version one would be. Six months from now. Something like that. Or maybe.

### You (2025-08-29T18:05:12.025Z)

Version one would be in the January, early February time frame. Right. So this is saying early to mid September, let's say this is going to. Be mid. To late. September. Okay? And so let's just say October 1st.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:05:41.943Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T18:05:42.265Z)

So 60 days from October 1st will be. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:05:46.583Z)

No, but december. December.

### You (2025-08-29T18:05:50.905Z)

You're right. December. Okay? Yeah. So December to January. Right. So 90 days would be the January time frame.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:06:00.343Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T18:06:04.105Z)

Actually, because of the. Well, I don't know. The holidays probably aren't going to slow us down at all. We don't have like a large group of people who would be on taking vacation or anything.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:06:20.183Z)

Here we can say like early January on mid January for 60 days. Then 90 probably. Mid february, late february.

### You (2025-08-29T18:06:29.465Z)

Yeah, actually, maybe instead of just saying 90 days or whatever. Let's go with a month. So let's just say. January. 2026. And then this will be March. 20 20. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm. I'm doing everything I can to refer to quarters, but if I say quarter one for version one. You know, we definitely don't want to wait until March for version one, so. But, yeah. Version 1 1. So let's just say March 20eigth. And beyond. For.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:07:27.703Z)

Yeah, this March 2026 has. I mean, here we can plot it, do automated investment recommendation. This is lot of items.

### You (2025-08-29T18:07:40.665Z)

Remember, that's why I have the plus and on beyond that does doesn't mean this is what we're going to release in March. We might just release one of these bullet points. But the bullet points will, you know, some of those are probably going to take, you know, a year before we can get. Especially the high impact, the high complexity one that you're over right now. Those are some of the items. That we may not have the data, we may not have strategic partnership in place. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that. 's linear.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:08:16.983Z)

Yep. And I'm. I mean, once you and me are full time, we can, I believe, will directly speed up a lot of things, so get it done.

### You (2025-08-29T18:08:27.225Z)

Oh, yeah. I mean, we can always tell them that. It's like, okay, this is what we're looking at right now. But some of that V1 one, maybe it gets moved into V1, or maybe we're looking at a February. So, yeah, I think I want to be as. Realistic as possible.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:08:49.543Z)

That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that. 's why we should keep that in mind, because.

### You (2025-08-29T18:08:53.465Z)

Yeah. Yeah. If you and I start getting a reputation of over promising and under delivering at the very beginning. That's going to follow us throughout the whole time. So if we can push later and deliver sooner, That'll help us out as well.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:09:18.183Z)

That makes sense. That makes sense. So, I mean, whatever this Labor Day timeline, I never came up with that Labor Day. I always said, like, two to three months. But then these guys kept saying Labor Day, Labor Day. I never said no. I never said no. It's not Labor Day. I always say two to three months.

### You (2025-08-29T18:09:26.025Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:09:34.503Z)

And they're like, okay, Labor Day. I said, okay, we'll try Labor Day. We might not catch it. But I never said specifically no.

### You (2025-08-29T18:09:40.905Z)

I know.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:09:41.543Z)

The now it's like labor day.

### You (2025-08-29T18:09:43.865Z)

And I kept backing up. It's like they'd say Labor Day. I say mid to end September, and I don't think they caught it. Labor Day, Labor Day.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:09:54.343Z)

Yeah. Mark and die. And particularly Liberty. And I never said specifically no. So we will try, but I always say two to three months.

### You (2025-08-29T18:10:02.025Z)

Yeah, well, you know what? We're all equal partners. We got to push back. If it's not realistic, we just say it's not realistic. Don't feel as though that they're dictating anything when it comes to the roadmap.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:10:20.903Z)

It just makes sense. And I mean at the same time. I always wanted to deliver this as soon as possible. But.

### You (2025-08-29T18:10:30.105Z)

What do you all do?

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:10:31.783Z)

Yeah. And we are kind of trying our best. Only thing is my availability with other work that kind of enters the progress.

### You (2025-08-29T18:10:45.065Z)

That's true.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:10:48.503Z)

In. Kevin, this looks good. How would I think we can go forward with this? So if you could please draw and, like, draft a good email. Clarifying these things.

### You (2025-08-29T18:11:00.105Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:11:01.143Z)

But yeah, also right. Then when we come full time launch as they might assume that we'll just deliver it without that.

### You (2025-08-29T18:11:05.065Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I've. I've already talked to Diane and, you know, kind of educating her on what I do in life. One of the things I focused on is, you know, I told her, said, look, once we start producing features, And getting them out the door to users. I'm looking ahead six months or a year. I'm not. I'm not focused on. On this. So I can keep going. And I told her, like, but there's. There's gonna be a point. Like, why would I look a year out? When we're not able to keep up with the current stuff. I never know that, you know, we got to get the node. Working here full time.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:11:53.623Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T18:11:53.945Z)

Not have to worry about putting food on the table. Know. Otherwise we're all going to come to not a grinding halt, but it's going to slow down significantly.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:12:08.343Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-29T18:12:10.425Z)

All right, well, cool. Anything else.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:12:14.663Z)

Yeah, I think that is all.

### You (2025-08-29T18:12:16.825Z)

Okay. All right. I'll put together something. I'll probably just copy these into a PowerPoint slide or something. Just add some notes to that to let them know. Break it down into more detail. And say, this is our roadmap. So when I talk to Mike, he was looking at not only this, but he was like, well, what about three to five years out? Where do you see yourself going? And that's when I talked about a lot of the strategic partnership s, the data, all the stuff that we can do. And I said, look, if you want to sit down and go over. I didn't show this to him, but I just told them. If you want to sit down and go over our roadmap in detail, I'd be happy to set up a call with yourself, me and Mike, and we can talk it over. So he was interested in that, but he wants to get the investment part taken care of first. So I would imagine maybe a month from now, we'll maybe sit down with him and just kind of give him an idea of where we're headed.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:13:23.783Z)

Saska sounds better.

### You (2025-08-29T18:13:24.265Z)

Yeah. All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:13:28.263Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-08-29T18:13:28.425Z)

Yeah, you have yourself great weekend. Get some rest. Close to the laptop.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:13:36.263Z)

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.

### You (2025-08-29T18:13:38.025Z)

Yeah. All right, we'll see.

### Guest (2025-08-29T18:13:40.023Z)

See?
