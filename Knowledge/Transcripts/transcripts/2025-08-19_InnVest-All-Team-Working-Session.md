# Transcript for: InnVest All Team Working Session

### You (2025-08-19T21:31:41.005Z)

Time goes fast. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:31:45.564Z)

So that is good. In fact, it's almost Labor Day. Really close to Level Day. I remember what we were saying. Labor Day is six weeks away. Yes. It's now two weeks away. Busy. Extraction. Service has been the biggest. Time consuming part, but I think we are getting good results now. We are working on binding those results to the data base and then finally to the application. Should be coming up soon. That's great. Yeah. So, I mean, whatever I see right now, we are getting some good result from the one images.

### You (2025-08-19T21:32:44.365Z)

Fractionalizing the strength.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:32:47.404Z)

We still need to verify them further and then kind of put the result in database and then bind them back to the application. So great progress there. Joining, right? Did he say he had a conflict? I just want to make sure we wait for him, or if we just. He's not joining today. I don't think he said anything about not Johnny. Right. Everybody. Oh, there he is. Hello. All right, we're all here. So where do we want to start? Today, on the business side, I give an update of the operating agreement. Or we can talk a little bit about the pitch deck that Drew and Mark and I have been working on. Or if you'd rather start on the tech side, we can start with Vinode or Howard. So what do you guys think is best today?

### You (2025-08-19T21:34:06.925Z)

Everything is fine. You got to talk about the operating agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:34:15.084Z)

So thank you for your patience on this because every time I sit down to do it, it's like literally watching paint dry wall. And I will find anything to distract. I did make a lot of progress today.

### You (2025-08-19T21:34:16.365Z)

Thank you for your. Support.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:34:30.604Z)

So first.

### You (2025-08-19T21:34:32.445Z)

It is definitely a more detailed template than the original one.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:34:37.324Z)

Than the original one. So thank you, Drew, because it is much better.

### You (2025-08-19T21:34:37.885Z)

So thank you, Joe, because it's much better.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:34:41.964Z)

Two it is still very much a template. And because we're really using a little bit more time on sections like decision making and meetings and things like that that will fit the five of us.

### You (2025-08-19T21:34:45.885Z)

Because we're really thinking about you. True Operating agreement. I'm trying to find a little bit more time outside. Decision making. Things like that. That will fit the structure.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:35:02.764Z)

So I'm 60% of the way through. This is what I'd like to do. Like another day or two to be able to finish my review and my write up. Put it in a format, give you the red line back drew, and give everyone the red line. Along with the changes that I made, the OR selections that I did. 4 if I add some language that needed to fit, like the five of us. Do. I think then you should probably have your attorney glance over it and just make sure that I'm not out of bounds or anything like that, if that makes sense. From an LLC agreement. I clearly AI helps tremendously with this when you're trying to understand what's market and what's not market. And then have the five of us sit down and really just talk through the agreement and how we've drafted each section. What I found with the boiler template. Is typically to. How do I want to say this? Too strict, maybe. I'd say on something. So I've had to let there's one thing where it wasn't strict enough. So I'll start with one thing where it wasn't strict enough. Which was the concept of expulsion. We will have employees.

### You (2025-08-19T21:36:22.845Z)

Onto this, and we will be giving them shares of the company. And so it had a very generic, if not non existent, section about expulsion. And security is going to be incredibly important for us. The hotel industry is notorious for sharing numbers, and this is just something that came into my mind as I was reading it.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:36:45.004Z)

I'm reading it. We will never be without any individual numbers. Person will be the best.

### You (2025-08-19T21:36:45.885Z)

I'll never be able to get to any person or death of our company.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:36:54.364Z)

It didn't really have anything for bad acts or gross negligence, anything like that. So I found some okay language that I added there to give some protection for us in those type of cases. Where it wasn't flat.

### You (2025-08-19T21:37:12.285Z)

Flexible is the word. I'm flexible enough.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:37:14.444Z)

Where it wasn't flex. Things like meetings and decision making. The decision making is probably the biggest thing.

### You (2025-08-19T21:37:16.845Z)

He's known to.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:37:25.964Z)

And how some discussion about this because there's five of us, right?

### You (2025-08-19T21:37:26.205Z)

And I have had.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:37:31.564Z)

How are we going to go about making major decisions? What constitutes a major versus a minor decision? What's a general operating decisions. And so it was pretty non existent with that type of language or was nearly not flexible enough for our arrangement. So I'm working on trying to expand that language to truly fit how we're running our company. And then like, another area where I don't think where it was too punitive were things like individual bankruptcy and things like that. Because this is a very lean team, and I just. The world is changing. So I don't think it was probably on the stricter side for an LLC agreement in Delaware on some things like that. So 60, 65% of the way through an actual red line. And if I could have another couple of days, which I'll just then repeat this. I will send out the red line to everybody with one or two page cover note that explains or maybe it's in the red line why I chose the or that I did. And if I add a language or deleted language.

### You (2025-08-19T21:38:49.405Z)

I did it. And what the business.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:38:51.644Z)

Business reason is for it. And then, Drew, I'd love to have your attorney look at it. To just totally off base or. Hey, generally this is okay. And then the five of us can block. An hour or two hours and literally go through it and make sure we're all in agreement on some of the things.

### You (2025-08-19T21:39:09.245Z)

That's very important.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:39:11.724Z)

More along the lines of decision making and granting of shares and things like that. So I ramble. But it's a much better agreement. Thank you, Drew. Than the original one, and it's going to fit our purpose. It just needs to have a little bit more flexibility for our unique circumstance as a tech company with five founders. So that was the operating agreement. And in order to get the notary. I did Venmo him and he paid the contractors for the thank you. First month of work so that they weren't paying. Thank you, bro. I had updated with you guys earlier as well. Okay, good. Thank you, Drew. That's very huge. We can't. Honestly, we can't thank you enough for that. So really, thank you. Then do you want to go? I don't know. Drew or Mark. Do you guys want to talk about the work that the three of us have been doing on the dac? And the kind of putting our messaging together and things like that. Yeah, I mean, I think it's still very much in progress. We don't need to go into it. In too much depth. But basically just to say that, yeah, we, Mark, Dan and I wanted to. Get better alignment, make sure we were very aligned. On how we were thinking and talking about what we're doing. What's the objective? Of the company, of the product. And so we can clearly communicate that to potential customers, investors, et cetera, as we go out and do that. So we kind of touched on as far as what we've gotten done so far, it's really just like talking about what is the problem. That we're trying to address. And then what is the solution that we've come up with? Really? Just, like, how do we talk about that? So we don't have slides on it yet, per se. But maybe by next week we should have a couple of slides to show. So that we have one unified talking way to talk about all of this. Andrew, do you want to talk about. Because this was your approach, it was a really good idea. We're mimicking it. It's like there's a slide deck that only has few words and then a more in depth slide deck and. Then we're thinking about. Yeah, this is just. How I did my own slide decks is there's one I use for demos. Which has very few words. It's very visual. And then the other one is similar but has more text to explain what would usually be saying. And that one is used to send out more of like a marketing deck. And then Diane suggests we do, like, a one pager. And on the one pager, Diana, they get like something like even just that, the lifecycle management, right? We're talking about a line or a circle. Whatever it is, it could be an infographic. Like one sort of detailed infographic might be really useful instead of, or in addition to a one pager. Yes. And when you think infographic, are you thinking at a higher level or like the ones we looked at? The other day when I showed you those tear sheets that had all that information on them. Probably more detailed. More detail? I like that thing you took a picture of and sent to us. Something like that. All the things we've been talking about as far as pre acquisition, post acquisition, et cetera. Know, neatly arranged in a way that's very visual. Okay? Okay? And then we're working on again the problem, the solution, the language. Mark had a really clever idea. I just want to give props to it because he's a very good marketer. And so he suggested that we use, like we've been talking about an investment life cycle and he suggested we pun it the Invest in Capital V E S T lifecycle, like the Invest Life cycle. And I thought, that's really clever.

### You (2025-08-19T21:43:09.725Z)

Life cycle. And he suggests that we're going to be in Best Buy, NM Capital Vest Lifecycle, like the infinite lifecycle. And I thought, that's really clever.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:43:22.364Z)

So, I mean, probably one of our first quick little marketing messages is that we're going to start to be talking about the invest with R. The way we spell invest.

### You (2025-08-19T21:43:22.605Z)

So probably what was our quick little marketing messages that we're going to start to be talking about BMS with R, the way we spell and the best life cycle.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:43:33.724Z)

Life cycle. And then just. I'm sorry to cut you off. No, the reason we want to do that is that one of our biggest points of differentiation.

### You (2025-08-19T21:43:37.165Z)

I'm sorry to cut you off. The reason we want to do that is that one of our biggest points of differentiation. Is that our product, our platform is going to be an entire take someone through the entire life cycle.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:43:43.964Z)

Is that our product, our platform is going to be an entire take someone through the entire investment lifecycle. So from initial inception of investment to the actual disposition. And that's really our unique, one of our most unique attributes. There'll be lots of competitors that may do one part of what we're doing, but we're a full encompass, all encompassing platform. That'll take an investor or whomever the user is through the entire investment lifecycle. So that using that phrase really embodies what we're doing. Yes. So lots of. I mean, good conversation. And Mark has brought a lot of clever ways of wording things and things like that to the table. I did when I was working on the pitch deck this weekend because I decided to work on the pitch deck instead of more interesting.

### You (2025-08-19T21:44:36.685Z)

Operating agreement this week.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:44:40.604Z)

But I do think we're going to need to spend as a team some time on the tam. It is unbelievably large and large that I'm wondering if potential investors will believe it. I believe it.

### You (2025-08-19T21:44:54.205Z)

When we get to that. Beauty. From how red iq looked at it, I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:45:04.284Z)

Really is like a 2 to 4 billion dollar fee industry. When you put brokerage and appraisal and all of that together, the fees that are earned. And if we're just trying to take a. Get like a little wedge, share, like, 1% of that. Right. For digitalization of workflows. It pretty quickly equals 50 mil or even 100 mil. It's pretty crazy.

### You (2025-08-19T21:45:28.445Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:45:29.164Z)

But we're just going to go ahead.

### You (2025-08-19T21:45:30.445Z)

Yeah. I was going to say I would expect the TAM to be extremely large. And somewhat intimidating.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:45:36.284Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-19T21:45:36.925Z)

If you haven't already, take a look at that article that I sent that breaks it down into three. You've got your tan, then you've got your Sam. Which is what? Is most realistic for your product, and then you've got your som. I forget what it stands for, but that's the realistic number of contracts you can sign, and it's good to show all three. That article will help break it down into. The different groupings.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:46:12.204Z)

Thank you, Har. That helps. And it also helps me to hear you say that the tam could be incredibly big and intimidating, because that's exactly how I feel when I look at it. I'm like, oh, my God, this is so large. I was very intimidating.

### You (2025-08-19T21:46:23.325Z)

Well, I would actually submit that we put out two different TAMs, one for domestic and one for international, because there's nothing in our tool that could not be used internationally. I mean, all we need is a simple currency conversion. Really east side.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:46:44.604Z)

Yes. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that. So. And then I took a stab this week, and we'll talk about it when we sit down and talk about the TAM and the Sam and all of that. But of what our revenue might look like over a five year period. And I mean, I just, I used AI for so much of it to try to help me, but essentially getting to 500k in revenue the first year and then second year, 30 year, a much more aggressive ramp after that. But I think. I mean, if Drew and Mark and I just put our heads down and then we spend time as a group talking about the tam, I do think we can pull this deck together within about two and a half weeks. So in line with Labor Day, And then the last thing on my end, and then I'll stop talking because I know I have a tendency to ramble. Is that I caught up with my. She's my friend, Stacy Naldoni. Who is at Western alliance bank now. Drew accolades to you. She knows you, and you probably know her. She said you're incredibly smart, and we're very lucky to be working with you on this. She would love to have a demo after Labor Day when we're ready. She thinks the product could be very helpful to her team. She's a little disenchanted with the debt world and how they underwrite and do things that that came across. Diane, what is the role there?

### You (2025-08-19T21:48:14.045Z)

That came across. She looked at almost like a cheap operating office r for the hotel.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:48:18.924Z)

She's like. Almost like a chief operating officer for the hotel debt platform.

### You (2025-08-19T21:48:22.685Z)

That platform. Okay? Because I know the head of their photography.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:48:24.844Z)

Okay, because I actually. I know the head of their hotel group is a guy named Barry Lieberman.

### You (2025-08-19T21:48:29.085Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:48:30.044Z)

Okay? Who's a friend of mine. That's great. That's perfect. Strong relationship there as well.

### You (2025-08-19T21:48:34.925Z)

That's wonderful.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:48:35.644Z)

That's wonderful.

### You (2025-08-19T21:48:36.845Z)

The one concern.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:48:37.244Z)

The one concern she expressed is security, that they're. The bank is very, very answered questions how we might be able to work with them, but I don't know. I was. I was trying to volley something pretty quickly, and I just threw out the idea of a white label, and then we, you know, talked about it. For another 30 seconds and let it go. So. But again, another true potential customer to demo after Labor Day. What's the company called? The Shore S for now. Western alliance. Western alliance bank. Is that right, mark? Alliance. Yes. Yes. All right, so where do we go next? Who to pivot to? Everyone.

### You (2025-08-19T21:49:34.205Z)

Yeah. I've got a couple of simple things to go over. The first, regarding marketing. Last week I saw a post on LinkedIn by somebody who used to work for me and it's been a while, but she was actually an intern for me at RunIQ as a product marketing manager. She was getting her master's degree at Boston University. Overachiever finished, like, two months early. Stuck around and interned for a while because we were fighting like crazy to find a position for her. Either. A Cuba Berkadia But it just didn't work out with the way the market was going. They had a hiring freeze. Right. Otherwise I would have hired her in a second. So I reached out to her. She and I are going to have a phone call on Friday. I just want to touch base, see what she's doing. But I think she would be an excellent resource for us and probably fairly inexpensive. Just on the more or less on the marketing materials. Not sure if she could take on the whole go to market like the other person that you know, Diane, but when it comes down to whether it be social media, print media, conference materials, She didn't know standing job. And so, again, I'm not going to make any promises. It's not my decision to make. We'll see how that goes. But I think she would be a good resource.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:51:14.684Z)

Okay? Sorry to cut you off. Here.

### You (2025-08-19T21:51:33.485Z)

Talking about market.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:51:35.324Z)

Do we have any update our website or we just want to keep one page site? Mark. What are your thoughts on that? You're the best mind for marketing. Yeah, No, I think we definitely need to have a more expensive website. And I think this one pager that we've been talking about all week, when that's done, that may be a good thing to put on the site. Just to give or maybe some excerpt from that. Just to give people a little bit more color in terms of what. We're going to be doing. To hopefully talk about this a lot at the Phoenix Hotel conference, and hopefully that'll lead to people looking at the site. Next couple of weeks. As we bring our marketing materials together, use some portion of those materials for the website. So that's a great reminder. And that conference, again is October 6th. So it's like one of those. It's like us talking about Labor Day and saying it's six weeks away. I mean, the conference is going to be on us. Like, so if Mark's talking about it, we. Mark, if you're out there talking about it, you probably want something that's deeper than just the one page, the landing page, right, that we have right now. Yeah, I definitely think we need sort of something that gets into a little bit more detail. About what it is that we're launching. So we have some time, but as you said, not a lot. So we should definitely keep that on our radar screen over the next two or three weeks. Yeah. From our side, we can quickly add few pages to the site and that won't add up a lot of work. But we'll need to decide what all should go in there.

### You (2025-08-19T21:53:16.205Z)

Yeah, and that would be a perfect project for Carrie if we want to give her something to try first. I don't think she would do the actual building of the website, but she could give us some good designs. Again, just tossing that out as an option.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:53:35.964Z)

Totally love that idea. Which gets us, I guess, to the fundraising, right? Which is once we have the MVP and the decks done, we're just trying to hit this hard to find some friends and family capital to just get us started with some working capital.

### You (2025-08-19T21:53:55.325Z)

All right. The last thing I wanted to bring up is I'm having some Internet connections today. Does everybody see the screen that I'm sharing? Okay? I asked Drew what type of CRM he's using. I looked into the different products out there. Know, everybody's familiar with Salesforce. HubSpot is very similar. Most of these tools have a free version. But they're very limited. Like HubSpot only has two users, and we're going to need more than two of us accessing this. So, long story short, I did find a template that we can customize to our own. It's open source, so I copied everything over. This is just. Some of this is working, some of it isn't. I'm sorry, Mark. Did you have a question? Okay. Okay. Thought I thought I heard it. Okay, so, you know, this is your basic dashboard page where we can track the accounts, active deals, revenue, etc.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:55:00.044Z)

No. No.

### You (2025-08-19T21:55:12.205Z)

I set up the accounts page. This is something I did work on, although I guess it looks like it's refreshing. Now, let me quickly refresh the page to see because it's missing some information here. Okay. May have to go through this some other time when I've got a better connection. Anyway, this is something that I'm going to continue to work on. To see if we can get something. That is something we can use. Grow with and be kind of our own homegrown CRM. It may not grow with us the way we want it to after two or three years. At some point, we may need to switch over to something more dynamic, more enterprise level, but we can deal with that. So this is what I was going to show you here. We can add a new account in here, very simple. I added the different Personas here so we can identify whether it's broker, investor, lender or servicer, et cetera. And then you can always go back and then edit some of these and delete. So it's got the pretty robust functionality already out. Of the box. Then the other pages here. Obviously, we would track the deals through the pipeline. Leads would be people who go to our website and add to the waitlist. Rather than going with emails, we could have that form populate our database here. So everybody that fills in the form could be starting here as a lead. Then we can contact them, go through the process, activities. Tracking calls, meetings, any type of customer interaction there. And it's got a pretty robust analytics as well too. So obviously with just three test data in here, that's not going to look all that great. But plenty that you can do as well is on the settings. These would be for us as we put on there. You can determine if you want notifications, alerts, you can have your security import data from elsewhere, et cetera. So I was pretty impressed. For an open source free type of CRM. Know it has the core and the backbone of what we need, at least to get started.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:57:52.124Z)

What's it called again? Howard. Does it have a name?

### You (2025-08-19T21:57:55.165Z)

No, I actually got it off of the site that built it. I'd have to go back and double check. Yeah, it does have a name. I don't remember because first thing I did is change it to InnVestAI CRM.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:58:02.204Z)

Okay? Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-19T21:58:09.245Z)

So. Yeah, I don't remember what they had in there, but it was fairly generic. But this is residing entirely on my laptop. It's not connected to the cloud anyplace else. The way I think we could make this work is I can get this thing set up, handed off to vinod. They can upload it on our AWS server. And it would be fully self hosted, not connected to anything outside. So from a security standpoint, I think that would be pretty good. I'm not far enough into it to make an official recommendation compared to some of the other ones, but I think in a week or so, we can circle back, take a look at it compared to some of the other ones. Drew. You can kind of take a look at it and compare it to what you've got with Zoho. I know you said you mentioned them. I haven't used their CRM. I've used their email providers at one time.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:59:18.364Z)

So it's kind of meant to be. Like, there's a free version, but I don't know. It's meant to be an enterprise level, right? Then if you have a huge sales team, You can coordinate, create automations.

### You (2025-08-19T21:59:31.325Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T21:59:32.764Z)

And rules, but it was overly complicated. For me. It's just me.

### You (2025-08-19T21:59:41.165Z)

That's the thing with CRMs. I did do some deep research and came up with a list of, I don't know, probably eight open source CRMs. And then I compared them to Salesforce, HubSpot, some of the other ones. They're free version. And a lot of them. A lot of them just said, yeah, it works great. But setting it up was a pain, and a lot of people had the same issue. That they could only do certain amount, and then once you got to a certain size, you had to start paying for it, which is understandable. But one thing I am going to need is I need to subscribe to the tool that I'm using here, which is mgx. It is a much better tool. Than what I was using to build the proof of concept. I've already exhausted my monthly supply of free credits on here. After about three or four days of working on this. I think the level that would be appropriate is $70 a month. So I don't know. We haven't really discussed outside of. The items that the note is done with aws how we can go about this?

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:01:14.204Z)

That's the upgraded version is $70 a month.

### You (2025-08-19T22:01:19.325Z)

I would go with a month to month and not an annual simply because not 100% convinced that this is what we want to stick with long term. There's so many tools coming out, so many changes so quickly, that it's hard to commit to one. So don't need a decision today. We can discuss whether I want to go ahead and subscribe and just get reimbursed when we have some funds available to us, or whether we want to just go for it.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:01:55.644Z)

I think we can hold off on this right now. We don't have enough activity. That it's necessary. Depending on how things go over the next month or two.

### You (2025-08-19T22:02:09.165Z)

Oh, no. We definitely have enough activity. This is the platform that I used for the proof of concept and that type of tool. We're going to keep going on that. I will be using this type of tool almost on a daily basis to keep ahead of the development team. So while they're building. The av.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:02:34.604Z)

Oh, sorry, I thought you're talking about the CRM. Are you talking about the CRM?

### You (2025-08-19T22:02:35.565Z)

Yeah. No, the CRM is free. No, it's the tool that I'm using to build.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:02:39.324Z)

Okay? Lovable. Is that. Is it like a level? The lovable.

### You (2025-08-19T22:02:44.285Z)

It's like lovable, only way more powerful. Which is why it'll bit pricier than lovable.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:02:49.484Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-19T22:02:52.285Z)

This one actually utilizes agents that take on different roles. So there's a designer agent. There's a database Architect agent. There's the Engineer agent. Where each one goes out and does their thing. Whereas with lovable, there's just one AI that kind of does everything. So what I have found is this will do. A much better job. One time instead of, like, with lovable going back and say, okay, that's good, but I need to do this or change that or this isn't working right. So that's why.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:03:41.484Z)

How does this tool have a name like lovable? This is mgx, okay?

### You (2025-08-19T22:03:44.765Z)

You can see. It's here. Yeah. Mgx dev. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:03:49.004Z)

Got it. Okay?

### You (2025-08-19T22:03:54.045Z)

So far, I think this has been the best. Coding tool, but you can see. You can see up here. Tiny print, but it's still beta. And even in beta. It's better than, in my opinion, lovable bolt. Cursor. All those other tools that you hear about all day long.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:04:20.604Z)

Okay? So when we table this until Thursday, if that's all right, and then. Yeah. And then we'll figure out what we're going to do with it. But what you're saying is you use this tool every single day. So Drew was saying is, if it's just the CRM, let's hold off. But this is actually a tool that you have to. You've used. All your free credits. And so now we have to.

### You (2025-08-19T22:04:29.165Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:04:44.044Z)

Pay for this tool to be able to keep making progress, okay?

### You (2025-08-19T22:04:47.645Z)

So all of the stuff that I would like to change on here. Technically, I won't be able to do it until, like, three more weeks. But anyway, that's kind of wanted to get everybody up to speed. Lets you see what it is that we're working on there. If anybody else is familiar with a CRM mark, I don't know what you use, if it would be applicable to a SaaS business as opposed to how you attract your clients. If there's you're aware of.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:05:25.724Z)

Yeah. This may. This may surprise you, But I do with the old fashioned way. I still do it in Excel.

### You (2025-08-19T22:05:29.245Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:05:33.564Z)

So I try to keep it a little more simple. But yeah, it sounds like it's something that you need, and I've certainly supported it. One thought that I had while I was listening to you and Vinod before. Where are we? What are we doing with the leads that come in through the site? No one responds and fills out that form. Where is that inquiry going? The S right now is totally. We can kind of. I don't know if there are many and we have the access to that. I can send it over to everyone. On daily basis. Well, yeah, I don't know if we need to. I just. I guess my point is that if someone gives an inquiry into that site, We should probably have an automatic letter that responds and just says, thank you for inquiry. We're working hard to work on version one. And we'll be back to you. Just so that if someone inquires, at least they know we received it. Visa vis a some kind of automated response. Sure you can set an automated response right now. Give the message on the website itself, but we can set an automated response as well. If you could. If someone could please draft a message, that would be helpful. Yeah, I can work on that.

### You (2025-08-19T22:06:45.085Z)

I think an automated response is a great idea. Once we hit a certain level of volume, I would think right now. It might be best for. I mean, I would be willing to do it just to send an email. So that they can actually reply and get a response that it's not coming from a bot. Because, I mean, the first impressions right now mean everything.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:07:14.284Z)

I agree with you, Howard. In fact, I mean, I would be willing to even just call people back and just talk about it a little bit. So I just think you're right. The first impression is critical. And Vinod, if you want to just end it around, I'm happy to just call people, let them know. Generally what the plan is and let them know that we'll be in touch with them at some point in the next. Call it 90 days.

### You (2025-08-19T22:07:32.365Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:07:35.804Z)

Go back and send the list on daily basis and you guys can have a look. Yeah, again. You don't have to do it every day. I know you're very busy, but maybe at least once a week. Okay? Sounds.

### You (2025-08-19T22:07:47.085Z)

I was just thinking. I was just going to say right before that. That if we were to respond within 24 hours or even same day. So, Vinode, how many names are on there right now? I can't imagine that we're getting more than a couple at this point.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:08:04.844Z)

Are there 10 Diane Foxes or 20 Diane Foxes? Because I've tested it on testing as well, but for me, it's not. Not much work, really. I just need to hit a button and then email it to you, so. Okay.

### You (2025-08-19T22:08:10.205Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:08:20.684Z)

Whenever you want. Daily, two days or weekly.

### You (2025-08-19T22:08:23.565Z)

Let's do daily, Yeah. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:08:29.484Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. No. Well, I'm happy to take that out and follow up with people, if that's helpful. That is helpful. Thank you.

### You (2025-08-19T22:08:38.205Z)

Yeah, very much. You are way more skilled at that than I am.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:08:48.604Z)

Okay, so where does that leave us, then? The note? Is there anything you want to show today, or are we still in a waiting pattern while you work through some of the things you were talking about earlier in the call? Yeah. Nothing from demo perspective. I hope you guys had a look at the staging side. So it did make a lot of progress on the performer. The UI is ready. So you'll see the performer if you click on either the chart icon on the deals page. Or if you go in the Deal Detail page by clicking on the Deal. The view performer link there. If you click on that performer page. So you should see the UI is already built there. We got some gold results from the extraction as well. So if you upload Excel sheet or a PDF file, you'll see some of the data getting plotted right now. And some of that might be wrong, as we are still kind of refining. We are getting really good results from the extraction itself. Now, where we are is putting that extraction into the right database table. And then kind of binding that database result into the application. So that's the part we are working on. But we have made very good progress on the extraction of the Excel sheet as well as the PDF and images. Yeah. Most probably. And just for the non techies on that data extraction, that is AI, right? I mean that. Right? I mean that is AI that's doing that. Yes. For PDF extraction we are using AI model for excel. We have our own python code written. But we can definitely use that in what you call rag pipeline, or either if we plan to go using rag, we can definitely use that. Or as we have planned, creating the summaries, summaries using AI that we're going to do using the. I think for the sake of us non techies and all the non techies we're going to talk to, we can just say that this is one of the AI features. Because it is again. It's structured data versus unstructured. This is dealing with. Data that is more unstructured, and that is, again, we don't deal with any of that. The data has to be very structured and organized, and it doesn't work. So I think anything that's not. That is a very new way of doing things, and we could say it's AI. Yes. So as far as we have the data in the database, whether using our Python based services or the AI, as far as the data is good. We can use to summarize the AI feature or to talk to the AI. Suppose we want to have RAG type of functionality wherein we want to prompt base functionality on the application. We can use the same data for that. Okay? So you're using, for the Excel, you're using Python and for the PDFs and stuff like that, you're actually using a data extraction AI, because that's unstructured data. And with the tool, with the AI tool that you're using, we would want. Pretty soon we'd have. The ability to have prompt like interchanges. Right. For our clients would have prompt interchanges with the system. Did I say it back correctly? Right. Okay, so I'm in. The initial thought was we would be able to kind of extract the data from PDF as well as from the X. I was just using these AI models. But they were not doing great job on Excel, particularly. So for Excel, we kind of wrote our own Python service. And then for pdfs. But it doesn't matter, really. As far as we have the data in the database, We can use prompt based or any AI features like summarizing certain things. Okay?

### You (2025-08-19T22:13:28.125Z)

All right. So Vinod, you'll see that you and Raj and Shivam. I've flooded your mailbox.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:13:30.284Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-19T22:13:39.165Z)

Sharing the PRDs that have been updated. So the pipeline, or the deal pipeline, has been updated. There's a new field that has to be added there for the closing date. Drew, based on what you and I spoke of, I put together the requirements for adding the year to date column. In the pro forma. So it's based on the year. Of whatever the closing date is. So you have to have that closing date in the pipeline in order for this to work. So if you've got a closing date of October 31st year to date, it'll calculate the number of days up through October 31st for the year to date, and then pro forma for the remaining two months. And even if I go into I tested it, even if I go into 2026, it works fine. So. So that logic has been introduced. Into the pro forma page, and then on the valuation page, there were just a couple of minor corrections on there. Most of it was labeling that didn't match between the inputs and what the metrics were down on the bottom. So bunch of documentation. That was updated over the last couple days waiting for you in your inbox.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:15:07.804Z)

We'll definitely get to those. As far as the closing date goes, right? Are we getting that date from the New Deal creation flow or from the document itself?

### You (2025-08-19T22:15:16.845Z)

No. The closing date will be input by the buyer. The investor or whoever's closing it. So the anticipated closing date. Right now. It's only on the pipeline page, but I think it would. Be.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:15:35.324Z)

You're either at the deal, like when you set up the deal, the new deal details, or it could be during when you're doing the financing, equity or acquisition disposition, like that. Part of that could be either one.

### You (2025-08-19T22:15:49.085Z)

We can talk about alternative. Places. Now, in Red iq, we had a few fields that were on two different pages, and when you updated one, it automatically updated the other. So we need to figure out that there's actually a couple of fields now.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:16:02.284Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-19T22:16:04.925Z)

That fall into that category. That kind of going along with the thing about keeping it as stupidly simple as possible. I don't want people having to bounce around to different pages. But this is something not spend a lot of time on right now. We can work with our first beta clients. And just let them tell us where they think it makes the most sense.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:16:38.924Z)

Probably. We could add it on the New Deal creation flow and then populate from there.

### You (2025-08-19T22:16:44.445Z)

The deal creation the pipeline. It would be a column in the pipeline as well. That's where I have it right now.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:16:55.644Z)

It will populate on the pipeline. It is inserted in the date flow. I mean, deal flow itself. Otherwise we can have a field in the deal pipeline, but if user doesn't input that value, it's going to be blank on the fieldback.

### You (2025-08-19T22:17:07.085Z)

Which is? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, obviously, they're going to have to put in a date in order for the pro forma to work. One of the reasons why I put it in the pipeline and not the deal details is because the pipeline also includes the bid due date. And a due diligence date that they have to input, and there's really no place in the model elsewhere that it makes sense. That's the same setup that we had@red IQ. Those were some of the columns that you'd have to go into the deal details. In order to end it.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:17:50.924Z)

If it is a thief performer. I would probably put it on the destration flow. So that the user adds it upfront and then we have it available for all the pages.

### You (2025-08-19T22:18:00.125Z)

No, that makes perfect sense. We can go ahead and do that. And that way they can always go back to the pipeline and change it anytime. That's what we mean to have that two way. All right. I'll add that to the deal details modal and update that. I'll let everybody know that. That'll only take me a couple minutes to do that.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:18:31.084Z)

On that deal detail like create new deal flow. Howard, I think we should also have a dedicated field for deal name. I think right now we have property name, but not deal name. So we have DName and then properties separate Premium and property.

### You (2025-08-19T22:18:43.165Z)

Yeah, we talk. Yeah, we talked about how the clients may not want to refer to it by its actual name. So I have not done that yet, so thanks for the reminder.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:18:56.204Z)

Also, there's portfolio deals that where there might be multiple properties included in a deal.

### You (2025-08-19T22:19:00.045Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:19:04.764Z)

At some point. I know we've talked a lot about what is an object and what are the attributes and the dimensions that will go into the data models. At some point, we'll talk about that. I'll do that. Don't worry. I wouldn't have been able to look at it yet anyway. But when that time that'll probably all. Be like. We start talking about that, we'll be very clear what needs to be added. Or input from the user.

### You (2025-08-19T22:19:38.365Z)

That's a good reminder. I still need to finalize the account and user setup. Prd, and also to make sure that everybody's had a chance to review the formulas. Make sure that we're all in agreement on those. So I know, Diane. You've done the formulas. Vinod and Drew, I'm waiting on you for the account and user setup review.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:20:05.564Z)

Yeah, I need to do a few more. I need to view more of those.

### You (2025-08-19T22:20:07.805Z)

And Drew, I did incorporate the changes that you referred to on the first part of the formulas.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:20:09.004Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-19T22:20:14.205Z)

So whenever you have a chance to go through that second portion, just let me know.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:20:29.644Z)

Okay? So are we good for today? Do we get 10 minutes back of our evening, or is there more? Anything more that we should chat about tonight? Everyone, we're looking good. All right. So we'll Talk Thursday at 5:30.

### You (2025-08-19T22:20:49.165Z)

All right, See you guys.

### Guest (2025-08-19T22:20:53.804Z)

Thanks.
