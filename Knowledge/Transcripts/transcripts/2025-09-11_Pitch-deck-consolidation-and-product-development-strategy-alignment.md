# Transcript for: Pitch deck consolidation and product development strategy alignment

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:15:31.617Z)

All right. Actually, yes. Let's back it. Next. So, spoke with Diane earlier. I explained the safe note. In more detail. I think she understands that now.

### You (2025-09-11T21:15:50.037Z)

Ok, good. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:15:51.377Z)

And I told her that you and I talked about it as well, about the safe note, because she'd said she'd talk with you and. Anyway. But hopefully we can all just get aligned. I might even just recap what it is when we get on this call. Just trying to reset realistic expectations. For what sort of short term? Immediate compensation she can get.

### You (2025-09-11T21:16:17.317Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:16:23.457Z)

They were still frustrated. We ended the call with talking about. The pitch. I think. I don't know. She's never done this before. And like a startup. And I know exactly where she's coming from, because I was literally doing the same thing two years ago, three years ago. I think I set this to you last time, too. But anyway, it was a good call. I think it's, like, progress. I feel like she brought us together, so I'm happy to spend the time. I guess, trying to make sure she understands. What's going to be. Realistic and successful. And I talked to Mark on the side, too. I'm trying to channel some of. Because Mark knows way more than I do about this stuff. But similarly channeling some of what his experience and knowledge in a more tactful way. Yeah. So that was the recap.

### You (2025-09-11T21:17:26.117Z)

All right, Now, I appreciate that. Yeah. We did talk this morning about a number of things, but. Yeah, one of them was about the pitch book. And how she's been working on one from an investor standpoint. And almost as like we've got two separate pitch books.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:17:51.857Z)

We do? Yes. It's what she sent the other day.

### You (2025-09-11T21:17:55.637Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:18:00.497Z)

She said the other day. And then there's like. There's basically talking points. This is what Diane's put together. This is sort of what Mark. I mean, I've been. I took what Mark did and expanded on it.

### You (2025-09-11T21:18:24.917Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:18:28.737Z)

I think the challenge. A pitch book is. We can only pitch if we have a clear vision of what we're trying to do.

### You (2025-09-11T21:18:43.397Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:18:44.097Z)

Right. Like, what is the product? What is the business objective? All of that, right? The pitchbook is just a representation of that. And so I think. Diane is getting hung up on having a pitch book. But in reality, what Mark and I are trying to emphasize is that the pitch book is not the point. The point is that we need to agree on these underlying things.

### You (2025-09-11T21:19:08.517Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:19:09.537Z)

What's our mission? What's our product? How do we do it? How much is it gonna cost? Those are the things, and that's what's gonna go into the pitch book. So I tried to. I did say to Diane, like, look, these things in here, our mission. The problem of the problem of the kind of hotel industry. This is sort of the problem of how does the hotel industry tackle and use technology? The solution, the features, I'm putting it in a debt. But like this, this is the stuff that should go on. If we had an office, this would be, like, written in massive words on one wall, right? Like, this is the underlying structure of the entire thing. So we have to agree on that. And then from there, everything should be much easier. And that's what I think. Diane's getting frustrated because she's like, to her, it's very obvious. And to Mark. I mean, to all of us. It's obvious because we all have our own ideas about what it is, but putting it on paper. In a clear, concise, organized and agreed upon way is very difficult.

### You (2025-09-11T21:20:13.557Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:20:15.217Z)

I think we're super close. Though.

### You (2025-09-11T21:20:16.917Z)

I think we are too. One of the things we discussed is we. We will need two distinctly different decks. Presentation deck floor investors, which I think we're probably calling the pitch deck. And then another deck for clients.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:20:33.617Z)

Yeah. I think at the end of the day, we will have a, you know, template of 25 or 30 slides that we'll cover a bunch of different things.

### You (2025-09-11T21:20:42.277Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:20:43.217Z)

And they can be pulled from for different purposes. A handful of the slides will be more relevant for a customer pitch. The other, you know, some other set of slides will be more relevant for an investor pitch. But these first, the way I say it, like these first three, Right? Like our mission. The problem, the solution, the feature. Like those are basically, they should be the first slides we ever show to anybody. Right? Like customer, investor, whatever. Like, they explain basically, like, why are you talking to us? Either way, right?

### You (2025-09-11T21:21:18.997Z)

That all makes sense. I'm. I'm on board. Like we. When we talked yesterday, I'm aligned with what you've got going on here. I just think we need to. Somehow set egos aside.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:21:32.817Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T21:21:35.957Z)

Go through this and choose which of the, you know, we'll take the best of the best. There are some good things in her deck. I went through her.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:21:45.057Z)

No, no. And a lot of the wording I put here is from her deck.

### You (2025-09-11T21:21:47.637Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:21:48.897Z)

And I felt bad because I was. We were talking earlier today, and I, you know, she's like, I've spent so much time on this deck, and I didn't want to. I mean it. So I, like, I wanted to. I want to validate her because I think a lot of the content here is. Useful, but this is also.

### You (2025-09-11T21:22:06.037Z)

Maybe we use this deck. As the base.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:22:11.217Z)

No, no.

### You (2025-09-11T21:22:11.637Z)

Well, hear me out. Use this as the consolidated deck. If she likes the way it looks, if she likes the visuals, if that's what she likes in the layout, that's. That's one thing. But there are. You know, we can replace things in here with your deck. You know? Cause you have an outline right now. This is a deck. I'm just saying that maybe this is what we use to consolidate them. A different version of this.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:22:31.057Z)

I mean, more of just like. Yes, yes. The content. Once this outline is complete. Running this through this pop AI program, it'll take 30 seconds.

### You (2025-09-11T21:22:47.797Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:22:48.897Z)

To create a very visually appealing deck. I mean, like this one just.

### You (2025-09-11T21:22:49.077Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:22:53.217Z)

Like, these photos have nothing to do with what we sell, right? Like, this is like. Are we? It's like their furniture photos.

### You (2025-09-11T21:23:03.077Z)

Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I. I didn't think about that when we were going through. I'm sure she meant them as, you know, interior hotel rooms.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:23:09.217Z)

No, I know. It. Yeah. And there's also just way too, too much verbiage here. Way, way too much of verbiage. There's also, like. Yes. Yeah. And, like, competitive analysis.

### You (2025-09-11T21:23:16.757Z)

She admitted that when we talked to.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:23:20.177Z)

I would say, like there is no competitive analysis. We have no competitors. We are the only ones that do what we do.

### You (2025-09-11T21:23:25.877Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:23:26.177Z)

Period. Don't tell somebody who our competitors are.

### You (2025-09-11T21:23:29.397Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:23:31.297Z)

Right. So. But, like, other things, like, she talked about this network effect and how it relates to pricing, and that's something I've put into my own pitch deck. Like, again, there's a lot here. It just needs to be consolidated. I'm gonna work on it after our call. Right now, I'm. Gonna work on this. I run it through Pop AI and, like, hopefully have something that both Mark and Diane will agree on. We will all agree on. And then both from a, you know.

### You (2025-09-11T21:23:46.677Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:23:58.577Z)

Underlying like, what are we trying to do? What is the problem we're solving? What is the product? Etcetera. Right. Like that's really what we need to do. And that actually gets me to what I wanted to ask you about before our call is I would like to have. Like we talk about, you know, operations. Finance. Customers, investors. Right. Like this. Even with my own business, I struggle with this part of the conversation. Like talking about the product. And the, you know. Because it should be a circular conversation of, you know, what do our customers need now? We don't have any customers right now. But what do our customers need? Out of the product. What is the product? What do our customers need? What are we working on? Is that what our customers need? And we should be able to talk about all that, but I struggle with how to organize that. And. I what I think. Would like to be able to do is talk about the core components of the product. You know, document scraping. Pro forma valuation, and we can talk about. Or maybe the node, and you can talk about the progress we're making on each of those components and, you know, like, how are we have a timeline for each of these components? How are we doing? Are we still on pace to have, you know, feature 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 done by the end of the month.

### You (2025-09-11T21:25:37.477Z)

Yeah, I can. I can. I can help with that. Probably. I mean this. I don't think it's very common to have engineering on a call like that.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:25:54.897Z)

Yeah. I mean.

### You (2025-09-11T21:25:55.877Z)

I think you know Vinod and I can contribute to the deck and to talk about.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:00.177Z)

Well, this is not for the deck. This is for our weekly calls. I'm talking about. I just mean for our internal weekly call. I want us to be able to.

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:02.437Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:08.497Z)

Like.

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:08.837Z)

Okay, Okay. I thought you thought you were trying to group this together to include.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:10.097Z)

Yeah, this. No, I mean, this may go in, this may feed into the deck somehow, but. Right. This I'm talking about for our internal weekly like or bi weekly calls, I want us to be able to very clearly.

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:16.917Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:26.657Z)

Discuss, you know? From a product perspective, what is being worked on, you know, what's complete, what's being worked on. How far along is it? When is it going to be completed? Are there challenges? Do we need more resources?

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:42.197Z)

Right? Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:44.097Z)

Right. Like, those are the conversations which we should have. And, you know, so it's.

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:46.757Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:26:49.537Z)

I don't know if that's like you and Vinod. I don't know how to do that because it's sort of product and technology.

### You (2025-09-11T21:26:56.197Z)

I think you've got it broken up correctly here. So I would do the product, Vinod would do the technology. And those are all. I would say the way you've got them separated there is accurate.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:27:13.377Z)

Yeah, so. But somewhere in one of these, or maybe it's somewhere else I want to talk about. And maybe this is. We don't need to do this forever. Maybe it's just right now, while we're in such a heavy product development stage. But I want to be able to talk about, you know what? It's unclear to me. And very. It's very unclear, Mark, but even somewhat to me, like, what is Vinod working on specifically? Right. Like there's the documents. Scraping. Pro forma. Valuation.

### You (2025-09-11T21:27:56.277Z)

I can tell you right now, that's going to be almost impossible. Because they don't necessarily work on things in the order that they are in the. Model. They start with the core things that affect the most. So, you know, if you take a look at what Vinod has right now, he's got the. Deal creation modal in the pipeline. The button to generate an AI summary. And the. What was the other one that he showed? Pipeline. The main page. So it. When you. When you're. When you're writing code in software, sometimes it seems like it's jumping around, but the pipeline is the core. That would be the list of all the deals that the user has. So then we have to have a way of getting that data in there. The button. Is Vinod going off script? Say and working on something that's not in line, but what he's got the engineers working on and what he did with the button. Are two different things. So I understand, you know, it makes sense to go through here, but document scraping, yes, that is something that the team is working on. They're working on that. But to break down the AVM into pro forma valuation, etc. That's where we're kind of not be able to do it. So I would just say AVM for now. And not the individual modals. Just.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:29:45.857Z)

Components. Yeah. That's. That's totally fine.

### You (2025-09-11T21:29:48.677Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:29:52.177Z)

And then we talked about. I mean, is AI like deal summary? Or is it. Or should we just say AI features? Or should we go down and say, like, because I think there's like, three or it's the deal summary. And then there's the market research. So it goes out and grabs the market research. I think the market research was secondary. The deal summary feature was going to be. First.

### You (2025-09-11T21:30:18.597Z)

Right? Yeah, yeah. So I've got. We've got that 530 call for that. Vendor Diane set up, so I'm gonna go ahead and jump on that.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:30:27.937Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T21:30:34.437Z)

But, yeah, let's. Let's go ahead and talk about this. You know, right now you've got document extraction on technology, Document scraping and product, it's the same thing. What I. What I think is gonna be easiest, just combine product and technology. Just call it product and technology. And that way we don't worry about duplicating things. And just combine it into one list. Does that make sense?

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:31:06.737Z)

I think, yeah. I've honestly, like, go back and forth on that in my own business.

### You (2025-09-11T21:31:10.677Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:31:14.097Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T21:31:15.957Z)

Yeah. So staffing, you know, I'm. I 'm looking for a product manager focusing on AI. He's got, you know, so there's a lot of things that we're doing. That really are. Things that we could just speak to. In one group.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:31:36.497Z)

Yeah. Okay. And this. This is again, just for our internal call s, like. But I think having the right groundwork for these calls is going to make. You know, we could. It'll feed into, like, everything else, like the pitch deck.

### You (2025-09-11T21:31:46.997Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, we could put, you know, obviously staffing would be consolidated. Infrastructure would be, you know, up there with, you know, maybe before the document scraping. And then pro forma is the avm.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:32:06.337Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T21:32:07.637Z)

And then database diagrams. Yeah, I mean, that would be something that Vinod would specifically speak to and staffing, you know, we would both go for.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:32:17.377Z)

Yeah. Okay, this is good. This is good. All right, well, we'll chat on this other call.

### You (2025-09-11T21:32:21.957Z)

Okay, thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-11T21:32:23.457Z)

Okay, thanks. Bye.
