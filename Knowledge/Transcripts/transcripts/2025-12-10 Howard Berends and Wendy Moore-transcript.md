# Transcript for: Howard Berends and Wendy Moore

### You (2025-12-10T16:31:41.543Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:31:45.540Z)

How are you?

### You (2025-12-10T16:31:48.583Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:31:48.820Z)

Good morning. I am excited to talk to you about Digital today. Did you have a chance to look into the company? A little bit.

### You (2025-12-10T16:31:52.263Z)

Yeah, I've done quite a deep dive on it, so I almost feel like I'm an expert on digital right now.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:32:01.620Z)

I hear that. I'd love to hear your first thoughts. What kind of attracted you to this opportunity?

### You (2025-12-10T16:32:08.183Z)

The job description, quite frankly. My history and my passion has always been in analytics reporting. I've always been a numbers person. I've spent my entire career in multifamily, so I haven't really been looking tremendously hard over the past few months. I would describe it as more of a sabbatical and doing some consulting work. I'm working with a project right now that will end at the end of the year. But I've been spending an awful lot of time. Learning and getting into AI. I've been working with AI, machine learning, the GPTs for probably three to four years now. But I will scan the job listings occasionally. And when I saw this one pop up and I read the description, I thought, you know, this is a perfect bit. I need to reach out to them.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:33:26.660Z)

Love to hear that. Yeah, well, I definitely saw that same alignment. And we're excited to talk with you about this opportunity. It is rare to see somebody with the depth of multifamily crew that you have. And so I'd love to hear a little bit as well about what have you done in the reporting, specifically reporting, like data analytics and reporting side of things.

### You (2025-12-10T16:33:49.463Z)

Oh, yeah. Hang on here. It's kind of going to take a while. Like I said, I've always been a numbers person. My degrees in finance and economics. When I was in multifamily operations, I was in asset management, so it's always been around budgeting.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:33:51.860Z)

So if you could expand on that a little bit.

### You (2025-12-10T16:34:09.063Z)

Number crunching for renovations, acquisitions, et cetera. I'm one of those people who can claim to be an Excel expert and back it up. There's a lot of people who. They've learned a new formula and they think they're an expert. But I can write code in vba. I can do all sorts of things. This is kind of how I also transitioned into product management. So I was living in Dallas at the time. Had a lot of contacts at RealPage, and because of my analytics experience, they actually recruited me to help them develop their first BI tool, Real page they called Central Reporting. And that's where I basically got the tech bug. And from that point on, it's been pretty much entirely in the prop tech space with analytics. After that. Position, I became involved with aum, which is a utld billing company based in Chicago, and I was their director of Product or Director of Business Intelligence, which was product management for that. Where I developed their AI and business intelligence and dashboarding from scratch. Prior to that, they had just your run of the mill Excel reports. And then from that point with nwp, NWP was a little bit more of your typical product management, but I actually oversaw the energy management, which was the invoice processing, which is where I became very involved with AI processing, machine learning and OCR. So that was back in 2016, 2017. Ten days after I joined NWP, they were acquired by RealPage. So I was back at RealPage. But for that entire time? Yeah, I spent a lot of time. Basically everything involved was analytics. So again, I continued in the same role, which was overseeing the analytics business intelligence and kind of expanded out. Also. This is when ESG and sustainability was getting popular, so I put together the analytics for that program as well. And it's been basically snowballing ever since. I don't think I've had a job. Since 2011 that hasn't overseeing and had reporting and analytics involved with it.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:37:11.380Z)

I definitely saw that trend in your, in your resume. A big part of why I wanted to talk with you. And that's, that's great. Thank you for that. I always want to hear a little bit more about your career journey. Right. I can see the threads on your resume, but there's always more of a story there.

### You (2025-12-10T16:37:21.863Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:37:26.740Z)

So thank you for that. What would you say are your kind of top superpowers as a product manager?

### You (2025-12-10T16:37:34.423Z)

My experience in proptech, I think my superpowers really is in being able to communicate. Equally well with the clients because I know the business in and out. As well as the product team and. Making sure that the product team understands the why. We're doing things. Because in every job I've had, whether it's the designers, the data architects, the people writing the code, They don't come from real estate. They don't have a real estate background. So it's way easier and more efficient to spend a lot of time on the front end educating them why this is important, why are we doing this, or what is the meaning behind it? Than it is to just give them documentation, say, okay, go build this. If that's the case, you just keep going back and forth, running around those circles, fixing things. So I would say that's probably my superpower is just having that very deep domain knowledge and being able to also talk the talk with the technical team.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:38:59.620Z)

Can definitely agree. Do you feel like you have any. I would call it kryptonite. As a product manager, anything you get kind of bogged down in or don't particularly love.

### You (2025-12-10T16:39:06.263Z)

Not really. I mean, there would have been a time three or four years ago where I would have said writing the documentation, but now, with AI assisting and helping things out there, You know, I've got a system down now where I can, you know, put together some very detailed documentation for the team very quickly. So, yeah, I don't really think of anything that I don't like or I'm uncomfortable with. I've been doing this for such a long time and, you know. Like I said, I've got that domain experience that I don't feel like I'm ever blindsided by anything. In fact, it's kind of the opposite. You know, I love to work with the clients because, you know, they're coming up with some really innovative ideas.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:39:55.860Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-12-10T16:40:01.063Z)

That can be adopted and used throughout, you know, the organization.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:40:14.100Z)

I love that. Yeah. And you, you highlighted a couple of projects or kind of overview earlier, but I'd love to hear and I'd love to hear two scenarios or they can be one and the same, one project that you were the most proud of and then one that leveraged AI in some way. They can be the same or they could be different, but love to hear some examples.

### You (2025-12-10T16:40:29.703Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No, I think they would be the same. So in my last role at rediq, just a real quick background. Rediq is a product that is used by multifamily investors. And it uses machine learning and AI to ingest rent roles and financial statements. Extract the data, standardize it and let them do their underwriting. So when I joined rediq, that's all it did. It was just for investing. So when a deal comes on the market, they use RedIQ to come up with what they think the property is worth. And then they either buy it or they don't, and then. They don't see rediq again until the next deal comes around. I immediately realized that the data that they're using. To do the underwriting. Is the same data that they continue to use when they're managing the properties and on it. So the first thing I did is help to develop what we call the Lifecycle Management suite. Which extends, like it says, all the way through from the time the property is listed to the time they eventually sell it. So as part of that, we did a lot of different reports that were geared towards the owners. Things that allowed them to create multiple scenarios, like should I refinance it, Should I put in some more capital expenditures, or should I sell it? Things like that that would go along with that. So that required a lot of work on the back end. Because we had to create a mechanism for which they could actually use this on a monthly basis and upload the data and make it easier, more accurate. Nobody had really touched the backend. Since it was developed. And. It was advertised as we can process any rent roll and any financial statement which was true. It wasn't a lie. But the ones that didn't get a process electronically went to an offshore team where they manually. Input, right? So even though it was offshore, it's expensive, so we spent a lot of time working on the algorithms and getting that cleaned up, so it was way more accurate. And we also then worked with. We had a very good data science team, and we integrated a lot of different analytics into the tool. That go well beyond the acquisition. But at the same time, I realized that a lot of the tool was kind of working in a vacuum. Only address certain things, and it didn't have the demographic data that people needed. And, you know, what are the jobs, you know, to make even the acquisition decisions? So that was the other part that I helped bring in, was working with the data science team and bringing in all of this other data that would basically use to establish guardrails, right? So as long as your numbers are between here and here, you're fine. But if they get outside of these guardrails, You need to go back and reevaluate. So that's probably the one that first off, I was even very proud of the fact that, I mean, we basically created an all new product line.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:44:09.140Z)

Yeah, absolutely.

### You (2025-12-10T16:44:14.183Z)

Bringing in more revenue. Which was just simply taking what they already had and just expanding it out. Clients loved it. There was nothing else like it out there.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:44:33.540Z)

Thank you for that. It's. It's always fascinating to hear some of the details behind those, the decisions and inflection points, so thank you. Just checking through on a couple of my. I know I have a lot of questions here, but always, of course, happy to answer yours as well. I'm. I know I asked you about what your. What you're really maving at, what you're good at. Is there anything you're just not interested in doing professionally?

### You (2025-12-10T16:44:53.863Z)

Oh, that's a loaded question. Yeah. No, no. I mean, it's an easy question to answer, but people can misinterpret it. I don't.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:45:01.940Z)

And there's no wrong answer. We just lie like that?

### You (2025-12-10T16:45:07.703Z)

Have a goal of becoming the Chief Product Officer. I'm not into climbing the corporate ladder. I'm really good at what I do. I've been doing it long enough. I do like to mentor teams. I do like to have a small team or multiple small teams that I work with. But I'm a very creative person. And I like to be the individual contributor. I don't want to delegate all of this stuff. I want to do it. I want to get in there, I want to create it, and I want to do it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:45:46.420Z)

Yeah. Well, that's a good call out, to be honest. And yeah, that's a good call out because, you know, there's, there's many paths to you continue. I see route and become an expert and go deeper in that or the people management. And I see a lot of people who get too high in that and they're managing people and not actually having their hands on the product anymore. And so I, I respect that and certainly understand this is an IC role. It's the lead of this product line and maybe will likely be a lead and subject matter expert for this reporting line, but isn't meant to be like the, the director product who will be managing more people.

### You (2025-12-10T16:45:55.463Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:46:27.780Z)

So thank you for sharing that. That's. That's helpful. And answered my other question, which is, what are some of your career goals?

### You (2025-12-10T16:46:31.383Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah, well, like I said, it's a double edged sword because a lot of people take that and say, oh, well, you're not motivated or you're lazy. It's like, well, that's not true. You know, I had multiple direct reports that Reddick, every position I've had, I've had direct reports. It's not that I don't want to be the leader, you know. At RedIQ, I was senior director, which is right below the main meter.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:46:34.740Z)

And the next kind of three, five years.

### You (2025-12-10T16:46:58.183Z)

So, yeah, I don't. I don't have aversion to leading teams. I just don't want to be the one who spends all day just shuffling paper and meeting after meeting after meeting.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:46:58.660Z)

Right. I get that. Yeah. And honestly, I think in product and engineering, yeah, I spend enough time hiring and product and engineering to see there's. There's really like two. Two differing paths that you can do to continue to advance your career to someone more of a principal.

### You (2025-12-10T16:47:18.743Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:47:28.340Z)

And so, yeah, that. No, no cons there. We certainly understand. And so I'd love to just make sure we. We chat about the really practical stuff really quickly. So, I know you applied, so hopefully you saw a lot of this in the job description. I did want to clarify where you located Howard. Howard.

### You (2025-12-10T16:47:40.823Z)

I'm in michigan. Just north of grand rapids.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:47:47.940Z)

Michigan. Okay, what part? Okay. Nice. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Michigan. I personally am in Missouri, so got a little more south in the Midwest, but Michigan's a beautiful area.

### You (2025-12-10T16:47:57.463Z)

Yeah. My niece and her husband are in Kansas City. And been there many times. It's a really cool area.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:48:07.060Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-10T16:48:10.023Z)

We were in single digits yesterday, and now it's back up to yeah. Yeah, it is, it is. But, yeah, today is one of those icy days. Cars in the ditches everywhere.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:48:10.340Z)

We're a little warmer down here than you are, so we still have plenty of snow. But yeah. Yeah. Lake effect is real.

### You (2025-12-10T16:48:22.663Z)

I don't have to worry about it. I've been working remotely since 2010.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:48:23.780Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-12-10T16:48:29.783Z)

I know a lot of people didn't experience it until the pandemic, but it's been my life for the last 15 years.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:48:31.540Z)

Good to work remote. Yeah. Awesome. Well, we're built for that. We're distributed teams. So we do have a headquarters outside of Denver in Inglewood, Colorado. So we have a. We have more of a hybrid arrangement there. We have a great office, but the rest of our team is distributed all over the US and so we're set up for that. We're, you know, happy to accommodate. There's no reload with this role. There's also not really any expected travel. We might maybe annually start doing some on site things like that. Or as needed. But it's more of an as needed, not a consistent part. So I'm glad you're used to working remotely. And I do always just like to make sure we're on the same page for salary expectations, make sure it's lined there. So the salary range again. Hopefully you saw this disclosed in the role, but we have it between 180 to 210, but that's a pretty broad range. I'd like to talk about if there's a specific number in there you're targeting.

### You (2025-12-10T16:49:30.183Z)

No, there's not a specific number. My last role was at that top end of the range. But. Yeah, again, I've been doing this long enough, and I've worked for some pretty crappy companies and got paid well. And I don't want to make that mistake again. Salary is not number one on my list of criteria, so we're in the range.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:49:50.900Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-12-10T16:49:56.823Z)

What is most important is having that creative freedom and working with a very close team and creating some really cool stuff.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:49:58.580Z)

Let's talk about that. What is most important. Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-12-10T16:50:11.543Z)

That's what I really like. I don't do well in organizations where your priorities and things are driven from the top. In product management, we call those the hippos. You're probably afraid. Familiar with the term. Like I said, being creative and being able to explore things. I don't like to just follow the status quo. I look at other industries. And see what's working very well. How can we adapt that to what we're doing? I look at all of the technological advances in the last couple years. I'm really deep into the Claude code, the lovables, all of those tools that are out there. Being able to put together a prototype in hours or a couple days, as composed as opposed to going for two week sprints just to come up with a wireframe. There's just so many things going on. And.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:51:31.700Z)

It is fascinating how quickly we can iterate now with some of those tools. Especially, I think product has been one of the more interesting roles to see evolve because of AI.

### You (2025-12-10T16:51:35.063Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:51:40.580Z)

In a lot of ways. Good. Well, you probably saw again, in our kind of laundry list of benefits, we care a lot about the balance and the benefits that we provide. So we do have a four day work week. That's one of our best benefits. Every Friday is off.

### You (2025-12-10T16:51:48.823Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:51:59.140Z)

I will just explain a little bit more about how that played out real in reality, because I get asked that really four days or it really is. You walk that day, there's no expectation for you to be on. I always think about it as if you end up working on that day. It's like pulling some extra hours on the weekend. It's over and above, it's on your own kind of drive. Sometimes it happens if we have a product launch or something, you know, pressing. But more often than not, there's no expectation to be on on Fridays for us. So we do abide by that four day work week. We care a lot about that. And you'll see that. So for high growth and we're driven and we care about balance. And so there's, there's all those kind of factors in there. So just like to address that and kind of how that plays out in reality.

### You (2025-12-10T16:52:00.103Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:52:44.500Z)

And then we do have the work from anywhere policy. We have a great profit sharing bonus. So we're privately held. There's no equity with this role, but we do have a profit sharing structure. We have great pto. I can go into more details on that, but you'll see kind of in the benefits. We cover good health benefits. We cover 75% of employee benefits in that. And then we also have some additional stipends. We have a physical wellness stipend and a mental health wellness stipend. That we provide as well. So you'll see a lot in our they're baked into our benefits, like the things that we care about. How we like to treat our team. Again, we care a lot about building good products. We also care a lot about keeping the people on our team really happy and well taken care of. So any questions about any of those things or anything you wanted to ask about?

### You (2025-12-10T16:53:31.223Z)

No, no, I thought it was. I thought it was pretty clear. You know? Yeah, it's exciting to do that. You know, I haven't worked with a company that worked four days a week, but I keep hearing great things about it. To me, it's almost counterintuitive. It's like, how can you be more productive in less time or so? So I was like, okay for 10 hour days. Is that how it works? But yeah, no, it's. It sounds very good.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:53:47.220Z)

Yeah. Y. Ep. Yeah. Y.

### You (2025-12-10T16:53:57.703Z)

Yeah. No.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:54:01.540Z)

Not necessarily. I mean we, we consider it like four eight hour days. Like we say it's a 32 day, 32 hour work week. We like to, again, we look for a lot of like, efficiency, good process, good efficiencies.

### You (2025-12-10T16:54:13.303Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:54:14.500Z)

How to do great work. But, you know, efficiently so that it doesn't have to take longer necessarily. Again, the way you love our ji, the way we, we leverage a lot of things, we set reasonable expectations for product launches accordingly. So I think that a lot of those factors help. I would encourage you, if you have questions about it, doc Rajeev is our SVP of product. He's the next conversation you would have in the interview process. He can talk about how it plays out on the product team kind of week to week. So just to give you a little bit more color there. But, yeah, it's. It's real, and I think that a lot of our team really appreciate that.

### You (2025-12-10T16:54:47.463Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Well, that's great.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:54:52.980Z)

Kind of ratio and expectation.

### You (2025-12-10T16:54:53.623Z)

Is the team. Spread out. I mean, where are the people in terms of. You know, are we. The company's based in Colorado. Which I know their office is just. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:55:11.220Z)

We have team members coast to coast at this point. So we do. I don't even know if it's 50. 50 at this point. I'd have to kind of reevaluate that. But maybe 50% are kind of hybrid around the Colorado region, and then the rest would be distributed all over the country. But we're coast to coast. We're used to being kind of hybrid and distributed like that.

### You (2025-12-10T16:55:19.383Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:55:32.180Z)

And, you know, are set up accordingly, use a lot of notion boards, a lot of tracking, a lot of slack, so.

### You (2025-12-10T16:55:35.623Z)

Okay? Yeah. I actually used to live in Highlands Ranch, which is right next to Englewood. I worked in Englewood. I loved it very much. I've always said if I had an opportunity to get back there, I would. Now, I'm not saying that I'm going to pick up and relocate right now.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:55:49.780Z)

Okay. Yeah, it's pretty area. Y. No, you're fine. It's always open too. If you ever chose to then that kind of hybrid. Or just having the option to be closer to the office. But traveling out there is something as well.

### You (2025-12-10T16:56:02.903Z)

Right. Right. And what about the developers and the engineers? Are they domestic as well? Do we use offshore tailings?

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:56:17.620Z)

Yeah. So primarily domestic. Again, all. All remote. And we. We have eight currently engineers on the team.

### You (2025-12-10T16:56:20.903Z)

Okay? All. Right. Yeah. No, that sounds good. I know we're actually a little bit overtime, but can I ask one more question?

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:56:27.860Z)

Just give you a sense of the size.

### You (2025-12-10T16:56:36.423Z)

Okay? All right, so I guess the question is, what is the impetus for creating this role? I know it states it's a new role going to be overseeing the reporting pod.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:56:37.940Z)

Yeah. Of course. Yeah. And then I had one. One last question as well. So if you're good, I'm good.

### You (2025-12-10T16:56:48.823Z)

Is just because of growth, or was there something else? That we were missing and need to fill a gap in the product.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:57:03.060Z)

Yeah, good question. Yeah, a little bit of both there. So we've had great growth across the board from a revenue perspective. We have the marketing agency kind of generating revenue, and then we have the product itself. So we've just hit a nice inflection point. I will say when asked when I asked Rejeeve that same question, Of, like, why now? For this role, we really wanted somebody to guide the reporting pod, specifically, like, shape how we build and deliver this department. Because it's a very high impact domain. We want reporting to be the reason why our clients come and stay. With the product. So we really need a product leader who understands this space. Can deliver like on the product vision. And so it's a new ad, it's an important ad. We see this as a good growth levers for us going forward. And so it's. It's a pretty broad, complex area, as you know, and so there's adjacent teams to it that don't have dedicated teams now. So data engineering does not have a dedicated pm. Posts and fair housing are the other two. So this role was meant to kind of encompass data engineering posts. And fair housing and kind of bring that into one kind of strategy. So it's, it's very intentional, very necessary. It's a good growth curve, so it's not a backfill, it's nearly created position.

### You (2025-12-10T16:58:11.623Z)

Got it. All right. Good. Yeah, it sounds really exciting.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:58:31.300Z)

Good question. Yeah. Awesome. Well, I can let you know. So I'm working through initial kind of calls like this this week. We're scheduling calls with Rajiv, our SCPF product, next week. And so those calls would be typically 90 minutes. It's quite a deep dive into product roadmap, the scope, the role, technical requirements. So he's the best person to answer all of your technical questions I know you inevitably have. So that would be a good one. I will just ask on a high level, like what? Are you generally available next week? Is there any days you're just completely out of pocket?

### You (2025-12-10T16:59:02.023Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No, no, Like I said, I've been consulting with a firm, but that's just.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:59:08.980Z)

Okay? Awesome.

### You (2025-12-10T16:59:11.223Z)

Kind of a side gig, you know, that'll end. I don't have any structured hours, so. Whatever works, we'll make it work.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:59:26.100Z)

And my last question I would like to ask just from a timing perspective, is there anything I should be aware of for your decision making timeline, anything moving quickly close to offer that will impact your decision?

### You (2025-12-10T16:59:33.063Z)

Not. Not really. I am. Yeah, I am in the. I've had a couple interviews now with another position. But yeah. Yeah, there's, there's, there's still, you know, they outlined five specific processes, and we've gone through, too. So, no, I'm not under any pressure to make a decision right away.

### Guest (2025-12-10T16:59:43.780Z)

I'd expect that. Okay? Okay? Awesome. Well, let me know if anything changes or accelerates. I know this time of year, it's either really fast or really not. We're probably somewhere in between.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:00.503Z)

Yeah. Everybody's trying to fill those budgeted positions.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:00:06.980Z)

We expect it to roll over.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:10.263Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:00:11.540Z)

We expect this at this point in the year to roll over into early January. So, but we are trying to move as efficiently as we can. So we're trying to get through at least the first two stages of the interview process before we break for the holidays. And then early January would be kind of panel interviews, final interviews. We'd love to make a decision by mid. By about mid January. That would be on the early end of things, but we try to move through it pretty quickly, so. But I'm your guide throughout this whole process. Let me know if you have any questions, any feedback.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:41.703Z)

Sounds better. Sounds very good.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:00:41.860Z)

And I will follow up with kind of next steps and feedback here in the next place.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:45.703Z)

All right. Yeah, likewise. Yeah. Thank you very much. I apologize for taking over, but I'm sure.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:00:49.860Z)

Nice to talk to you, Howard. I appreciate your time today.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:54.423Z)

Yeah. All right.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:00:56.820Z)

Oh, you're fine. I always leave a little bit of flex time, so for exactly that. So it's a good conversation. I appreciate your day.

### You (2025-12-10T17:00:57.543Z)

Good. All right. Thank you. We'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.

### Guest (2025-12-10T17:01:05.380Z)

Take care. Bye.
