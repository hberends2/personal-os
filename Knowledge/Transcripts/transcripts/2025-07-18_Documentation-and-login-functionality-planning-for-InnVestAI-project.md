and that that won't be helpful.

### You (2025-07-18T21:00:43.031Z)

that would be helpful. Yeah. Well, again, like like we've talked about before, I'm hoping that know, they may not wanna use the code exactly, but at least know, if they have access to it, it is in the GitHub.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:00:55.817Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:00:57.851Z)

everything there, but they play

### You (2025-07-18T21:01:51.671Z)

we can get it from code as well, but it will be Yeah. Repeating for every year. Some

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:01:54.037Z)

we can get it from code as well, but it would definitely be able to have some

### You (2025-07-18T21:01:56.491Z)

document around that. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:01:58.827Z)

### You (2025-07-18T21:02:38.071Z)

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:02:43.357Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:02:44.361Z)

Three account of zero.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:04:27.687Z)

what pool did we get? We we can see that. Three account of Jira? You're saying we have three account of Jira. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T21:04:34.741Z)

With Jira. We have three accounts. Okay. So you and I are the only ones who have a Jira account. And then can I have one more one?

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:04:41.477Z)

Okay. And then we can have one more. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T21:04:44.051Z)

So we're gonna need at least one more. Would we need one for each of them? Or No. I can can probably share. They can share. Yeah. Yeah. We can just we can just create a generic login and

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:04:51.417Z)

No. I think they can. They can share. Yeah. And that's what I was thinking.

### You (2025-07-18T21:04:54.961Z)

let them do that. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:04:56.167Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:04:57.881Z)

Alright. So probably can

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:04:59.197Z)

So probably we can

### You (2025-07-18T21:04:59.331Z)

Could we have one ticket? There. And see that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:02.427Z)

create one ticket there.

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:02.871Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:04.137Z)

In Jira.

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:04.711Z)

Let's see.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:07.777Z)

Let's see. Do we have the Jira URL? Oh,

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:16.031Z)

The thing that I normally It's long with our

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:17.717Z)

I think it's just the login. If we log in with our

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:18.471Z)

office for Yeah. Office Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:21.957Z)

office or or

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:22.431Z)

Email. But here, I've I've got the

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:05:23.917Z)

office email.

### You (2025-07-18T21:05:25.661Z)

URL. Hold on. Got it bookmarked. So here's the URL to the the all ideas table. But you can navigate to the main Jira page from there. And then I believe it's the same number of seats as as Jira. I think yesterday we don't have content. Thought we did. But we do we do have technically, we do have a con confluence page. We may not have all

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:09.217Z)

I'm gonna say yes

### You (2025-07-18T21:06:12.081Z)

but Okay. I mean, we have it looks like it's a ZZAC syntax.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:12.927Z)

we don't have confidence, but

### You (2025-07-18T21:06:17.121Z)

And I don't like it. But I'm willing to use it because I just think that the way that Radix had it set up, according to Keith, was

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:26.937Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T21:06:27.951Z)

incorrect. And that if we do it properly, I'm sure I would be able to get used to it. So Well, quarters. Oh, three. That's what it says. Okay. So we can create one account. Yeah. And yet, so the how do we create something like like, for our

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:53.217Z)

Both quarters.

### You (2025-07-18T21:06:54.721Z)

Yeah. But whatever we do, we're also gonna have to do the same thing in

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:54.947Z)

One creator left. Okay. That's what it says. Okay. So we can create

### You (2025-07-18T21:06:59.371Z)

Microsoft. It'll have to have an InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:06:59.827Z)

one account. Yeah. So

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:04.171Z)

email. Oh, okay. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:06.437Z)

probably we can create something like developer and

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:07.151Z)

isn't a big deal. I don't think. I'll have to take a look and see what we've got available.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:10.097Z)

developer or

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:12.731Z)

Okay. Just I just want to make sure we are not so that can that

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:18.947Z)

Ah, okay.

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:21.631Z)

email and date, I don't think that can be shared. Right? The I mean, if we just created a dev

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:28.117Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:31.291Z)

at InnVestAI, they could use that for logging into Jira and

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:33.037Z)

Just I just want to sure we are not kind of

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:35.671Z)

things, but you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:38.247Z)

so email and Teams, I don't think that can be shared. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:38.311Z)

if they need an actual InnVestAI email,

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:41.517Z)

They

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:43.081Z)

or or something like that, then we would have to do each one individually. I don't know if they would wanna share an email. I guess,

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:45.737Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:49.631Z)

I guess they could. I mean, Yeah. Or we just or we just limit

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:07:56.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:07:57.921Z)

conversations with them to Teams. So if I create a dev at invest AI dot com, email. That would automatically create a login to to Teams as well so they could

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:10.887Z)

Yeah. I'm can take that. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:12.571Z)

all log in and share that

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:13.527Z)

So

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:14.451Z)

a Teams channel. Thinking? Do for some out in at the same time? That's I know. That that I'm not sure. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:24.667Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:25.941Z)

So It's not not like Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if one boots the other

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:31.607Z)

No. What I was thinking,

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:32.151Z)

that's that's gonna be a So Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:35.347Z)

can two person be logged in at the same time?

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:35.521Z)

Yeah. Two account. For having

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:39.037Z)

I

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:39.401Z)

then probably just

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:40.197Z)

I don't think so. I don't think

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:40.481Z)

click. Yeah. I mean, the thing is though, if if

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:43.317Z)

yeah. It's not not like Netflix or Amazon Prime.

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:45.241Z)

Drew and and Mark are gonna be making a bank to deposit, then it's not an issue. We're only talking $10 a month or

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:49.547Z)

Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, if we need two accounts

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:52.991Z)

I'm not not much. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:55.207Z)

for having teams, then probably we'll just create two separate

### You (2025-07-18T21:08:56.351Z)

so we we we did prepay. So I remember we each wrote out a check

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:08:58.467Z)

account because there's no point in getting

### You (2025-07-18T21:09:01.881Z)

for was it $10 a month or $12 a month? It might have been more because we had Yeah. I don't Yeah. Did $1.40 or something like that. I think it was, like, $1.40, $1.44, $1.48, something like that. Yeah. So yeah. So it'd be, you know, $450 out.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:09:16.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:09:19.161Z)

Of you know, to get it, and that'll give us the the accounts we need for a year.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:09:23.537Z)

Done. I think

### You (2025-07-18T21:09:25.061Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:09:25.317Z)

yeah, we gave one forty or something like that. That was

### You (2025-07-18T21:09:25.411Z)

So the other thing too, Mark is not using his InnVestAI, and I'm just wondering if

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:09:28.847Z)

yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:09:33.851Z)

Yeah. I'm I'm just wondering if if we can take it. Yeah. I don't know. I can make a mask. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:09:38.607Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:03.657Z)

we need young guys, like, can spend a lot of time. Because, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:10.241Z)

I think I'll get in. And

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:11.527Z)

yeah, AIs do a good job.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:11.771Z)

Okay. The tool. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:14.207Z)

And these are like,

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:15.661Z)

What what you are saying for sale. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:17.807Z)

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:18.921Z)

Sorry. What?

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:19.827Z)

that's

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:20.381Z)

Are saying for for

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:20.537Z)

solid.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:21.771Z)

Right? Word cell. Oh. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:27.527Z)

Then, yeah, they log in and

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:29.301Z)

I actually started to

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:30.127Z)

okay. And the tool, right, what what's

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:31.381Z)

replicate a personal project that I built elsewhere.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:34.407Z)

you are saying? What cell. Right? Yes.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:36.661Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:37.627Z)

We were saying what's still for UX. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:38.361Z)

it's doing a way better job. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:41.397Z)

Versal.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:41.751Z)

Lovable. A lot of times, you have to

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:43.447Z)

Versal. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:45.151Z)

try three or four different times before it gets it right. Even simple formatting

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:51.047Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:52.331Z)

This one, it's gotten it right every time.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:11:54.977Z)

What's up?

### You (2025-07-18T21:11:56.001Z)

I just give it one one thing. The only thing is the code, it basically puts everything. In fact, I even have it open here. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:12:05.757Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:12:08.991Z)

in the app itself, there's only

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:12:15.927Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:12:15.941Z)

a a looks looks like five TSX

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:12:16.707Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:12:22.201Z)

files for different models. And and some of them it's it's basically it's a personal finance. Tool that I have. So I've got a model to enter the bank information. Another mortal for entering transaction information, then I've got a table below that you can

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:12:39.977Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-18T21:12:41.401Z)

work on. And the transactions table itself is like, right now, it's, like, 1,200 rows. And so I I don't think it breaks it up into smaller chunks like some of the other tools does, but you know, for something like that, it works great. And the fact that you know, that I don't have to go back and over and over do it. I'm just really surprised. You know, this is something that I got a free one year subscription for a newsletter that I subscribed to. And I totally forgot about it for, like, three or four months. So I'm like I'm not almost halfway into the subscription before I actually started using it. And it's I'm sorry. I didn't use it earlier, but it's still it's still not enterprise level.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:13:29.027Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:13:29.701Z)

But the code you know, from what I can tell by looking at it, it it's pretty damn good. So Yeah. I know how I was talking about The US stores. I was really you know, No. The the UI is is really good. You know, I I gave it some pretty broad leeway to come up with a design. And you know? It came up with some amazing

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:13:57.367Z)

Yeah. No. No. I'm I was talking about the

### You (2025-07-18T21:13:57.721Z)

you know, some some features that I didn't request, but they were just like, oh, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:14:00.387Z)

tool. That was v zero. Right? On WhatsApp.

### You (2025-07-18T21:14:03.031Z)

That's pretty cool. I could use that. So so, yeah, I I think it's from a design standpoint, UX, it it works it works really well. And like I like I said, if you if and one thing I like about it, is unlike other tools in fact, here, I've got got it up. So screen some I see it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:14:33.107Z)

Yeah. How is it?

### You (2025-07-18T21:14:41.441Z)

Alright. So I didn't really specify any other than, you know, I I wanted to use cards with a with an accentuated three d effect and shadow. And this is basically what I came up with. So and, you know, and then, you know, if I want now, just click on the add account

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:15:01.357Z)

Stop. Stop.

### You (2025-07-18T21:15:01.681Z)

model. But, of course, everything is running so slow right now.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:15:04.707Z)

Yes. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:15:07.951Z)

But what I wanted to show is out of design part, I can click on the design tab

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:15:08.597Z)

This last time.

### You (2025-07-18T21:15:13.581Z)

and now I can go through and make changes. I don't have to put in a prompt and go in there right there. So, you know, if I wanted to change any of this layout of any of these items, you can do it manually. Of course, then you can export the code, and you can do whatever you need, add it to wherever you want. So Yeah. It's it's it's been pretty fun playing with it. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:15:41.407Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:15:48.971Z)

What are card on? Should we get started? See, now when I said that that doesn't a of planning. So probably that is one part where they can get started Sometimes, so one card

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:06.237Z)

Yeah. This is major op

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:07.321Z)

is more towards application development. It was doing much

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:11.487Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:12.171Z)

about that that that more towards

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:15.477Z)

Both.

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:16.191Z)

application development as well. Okay. So probably I could too. Utilize it. That side. To deliver that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:24.917Z)

I'm in

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:25.381Z)

So probably

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:25.777Z)

what are your thought on

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:27.511Z)

the

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:28.417Z)

how should we get it started? I think see, login, said, because that

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:29.241Z)

login page e u x. Right? How the UI

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:32.847Z)

a lot of planning or architecture diagram or infrastructure.

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:33.211Z)

UX and how the flow should work.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:37.217Z)

Right? So they

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:37.241Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:38.407Z)

probably that is one part where they can get started. So and

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:38.501Z)

ultimately, designing. Database, designing the APIs,

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:42.727Z)

so one guy is more towards application development. He's been doing much

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:44.971Z)

Of course, we need infrastructure before that. Yeah. So, yeah, probably.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:47.887Z)

learning and all that. The other guy is more towards infrastructure. He has done

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:48.431Z)

Then that's how we should go about it. Alright. I will start working on the documentation this weekend.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:52.857Z)

application development as well. So probably, I could reach

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:56.741Z)

Kind of kind of backwards because I've been

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:16:57.047Z)

utilize in on that side

### You (2025-07-18T21:16:59.511Z)

just building it on the POC

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:00.577Z)

too, the other guy.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:01.891Z)

pretty much on the fly.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:02.957Z)

Probably

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:03.661Z)

Not really documenting as I go up. I I knew it would get to this point.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:04.137Z)

the login page UX. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:08.331Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:08.397Z)

How the UI UX and how the flow should work.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:09.491Z)

I'll work on that. But then, of course, you know, we'll also give them the the URL to the PO

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:12.077Z)

And then

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:14.371Z)

so they can bring it up and

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:15.397Z)

ultimately, designing the database

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:16.121Z)

play with it and kinda see. And and, again, I wanna stress

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:18.007Z)

designing the APIs,

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:19.291Z)

to them, I'm not looking for an exact replica.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:20.857Z)

Of course, we need infrastructure before that.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:23.431Z)

Want you to kind of

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:24.047Z)

Yeah, probably that

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:24.621Z)

put together a

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:25.867Z)

that's how we should go about it.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:26.041Z)

a better looking product than what that is. So doing the follow-up on Monday. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:35.777Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:35.881Z)

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:39.307Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:17:40.151Z)

You have developed. Yeah. No. That's fine. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:17:45.047Z)

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:07.587Z)

Okay. Do do you mind doing a call on Monday?

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:08.081Z)

Yeah. No problem.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:10.837Z)

You, me, and both of these guys.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:12.421Z)

Probably, we can it would be working on plans. Well,

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:13.727Z)

And let's go over the POC tool that you have developed.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:15.921Z)

Yeah. It pretty much. Okay. Doctor. Also.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:22.467Z)

Well, yeah, if you could please

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:22.931Z)

Correct, please. Emails, then It will take

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:25.697Z)

create that document.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:26.321Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I got in there

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:27.167Z)

I would say this small screenshot

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:30.391Z)

yesterday because Diane

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:30.947Z)

like, you know, write a little bit and put a screenshot. Write a little bit, put a screenshot.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:33.581Z)

I can't believe we didn't bring this up

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:35.007Z)

That way, the other person doesn't feel bold.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:35.521Z)

earlier, but you know, she bought investai.com.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:38.827Z)

And, you know, they have live POC, so it's easy to connect that way.

### You (2025-07-18T21:18:42.761Z)

I don't know where I think maybe I was going to another website that was a .ai and, like, wait a minute. Why why don't we have innvest.ai?

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:18:48.737Z)

Probably Wiki would be Wiki or Confluence, whatever. You prefer. And, yeah, if you could also create these emails, then

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:00.181Z)

Okay. Well, she didn't.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:01.557Z)

it should be good to go.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:03.231Z)

And so I I pinged her. Yes. Yesterday and said, we gotta jump on this. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:10.307Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:10.921Z)

you know, I'm sorry. She may have just forgotten it. I I don't remember the but I'm sure you brought it up. And so she did.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:16.507Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:17.481Z)

We now own InnVestAI, and then she was trying to link the two accounts and then I got in there and I just was not able

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:28.637Z)

No. If you remember in the initial conversation, when she's

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:29.841Z)

to use her login and password to do what needed to be done. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:32.767Z)

said we I bought this, I told her that buy.ai as well.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:36.751Z)

I can't guarantee. I'll work on it. I'll I'll get with her.

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:39.257Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:41.241Z)

Tomorrow is my wife's birthday, so I'm not gonna have a whole lot of time tomorrow. So I'll work on it over the weekend. And if I can coordinate with Diane, get them set up, but

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:19:53.397Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T21:19:54.711Z)

we just might have to use their personal emails for the first day two. So Oh, okay. I'll be a minute. No. But there were there were certain times where you know, it would say, you know, you have to go here to create the account. And when I clicked on the button, I had to reenter

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:20:19.507Z)

No.

### You (2025-07-18T21:20:20.481Z)

her username and password, and then it would send the six digit code to her. And

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:20:21.647Z)

Think what it

### You (2025-07-18T21:20:25.361Z)

it was just really difficult for us to

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:20:25.697Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T21:20:28.291Z)

to coordinate. And I thought she had originally set me up as an administrator. And I don't know because I had a a

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:20:37.467Z)

Oh, okay.

### You (2025-07-18T21:20:38.701Z)

password

### Guest (2025-07-18T21:20:39.467Z)

Her email is messed up?

### You (2025-07-18T21:20:40.101Z)

login and password saved, but it wouldn't work. So I don't know if if that was temporary or not. So 60. Password. Yeah. Once something. Yeah. But what that we have got AI Yeah. Yeah.
