# Transcript for: Interview with Digible

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:01:21.785Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-12-17T23:01:28.025Z)

Hey, redeep, how are you? Good staining to get my earplugs in there.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:01:32.665Z)

Hey. I'm doing well. How are you? No worries. Well, happy to sort of gently receive you in. Today's definitely a scramble on all fronts heading into the holidays.

### You (2025-12-17T23:01:45.145Z)

Oh, yeah. It's been a crazy day.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:01:51.305Z)

I can imagine. I can imagine. Cool. Well, hopefully this isn't a huge disruption to your day, but super appreciative for you to hop on and spend some time together. I know you had a great conversation with Wendy. I got to catch up with her and hear a little bit about you. So yeah, definitely excited to be chatting today to kind of set the stage for a little bit of an overview of the structure of the conversation. Really like three sections or goals that I have today. So one is just share a little bit about digital and the role itself. I know you already chatted with one day. I know you've been in this space for some time. So you maybe have some more familiarity than most with some of the things that we're up to. But I'll share a little bit about kind of the role and the vision that we have for where it's headed. We'll then spend the bulk of the time me just learning a bit about you. Again. I've got that kind of first coat of paint from the conversation you had with Wendy, but diving a lot into your most. Your last couple experiences and just getting a sense of some of the projects that you worked on and, and kind of people that you've worked with. And then we'll park maybe. 15 minutes or so at the end. You can ask any questions. We could spend it however you want.

### You (2025-12-17T23:01:56.825Z)

Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. All right.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:02:59.065Z)

Just hanging out however you prefer. So that's overview. Any kind of questions or info I can provide before I kind of dive into it.

### You (2025-12-17T23:03:05.065Z)

No, I think. I think we're good to go. All right.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:03:10.105Z)

Cool. Awesome. Well, I know you've been in the space for a while, so. But I'll make no assumptions about what you do or don't know about digible. So I'll just give, like, a very brief overview of the business and then really dive into the reporting side of things and this role. Specifically. So digital digital marketing agency and the multifamily space. Our clients are property management companies. They hire us because they need people to live in their buildings and they need help with the digital marketing to drive those people into the buildings. And so to understand our reporting strategy or kind of this role and how it fits into digital, it's really important to understand and for me to frame, like, why do our customers hire us in the first place? And of course, there's that functional aspect of, like, I need somebody to do my marketing. I don't have any time because I'm strapped. I'm a marketing manager, and I'm managing 30 properties, and my hair is on fire. So there's kind of that functional aspect of why our clients hire us. That's definitely there. But at its core, why our clients really, really work with us is for the peace of mind and the confidence to know that things are handled. And so when our clients hire us and, and work with us, and the reason that they stick with us is not just because we sort of fill the needs of what they have as a marketer. But there's actually a much more sort of emotional need that our customers have of wanting to feel a sense of certainty and confidence in the chaos that is their daily life. And especially in those moments where there's high pressure placed on them by ownership groups, clients, whoever it is, when they feel that extra pressure, digital is that extra release valve of like, okay, I can reach out to them. They've got it covered. And I sort of get to. My anxiety gets to be alleviated a little bit. So why am I painting this picture in relation to the reporting strategy? If a big part of what we do day to day for customers is optimize campaigns, manage performance, do all this stuff throughout the month, At its core, the way that our clients really experience our value is once a month, they do a reporting call with us where they kind of get a sense of what has been happening in the world of digital, what has been going on in the world of marketing, and how do I understand the value that I'm getting? From here so that I can go communicate it to the people at my own company or to my own clients. And so reporting, in some sense, is the sort of bedrock on which we deepen confidence with clients, and we deepen that feeling of conviction and certainty that things are going well. Or it's the moment in time where the story doesn't add up and they walk away being like, I don't really know. I feel less confident than I did before. And so reporting is really at the sort of intersection of the work that we do to derive performance and the real sort of customer service and kind of need for confidence that we bring our clients.

### You (2025-12-17T23:05:43.945Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:05:59.465Z)

And so. I'm happy to. I'll go into I'll share more details if you have, if you want, at the end, about kind of like some of the specific problems that we're focused on solving. But at its core, the vision that we have for reporting is to evolve it from today. It is very much a marketing metric dump. That's a sort of reactive view into the past, and we really envision it evolving into a multifamily storytelling and strategist, where the reporting is actually not just giving you clarity into what's happening and why, but also being proactive in recommending what it is that you should do next.

### You (2025-12-17T23:06:39.385Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:06:41.145Z)

So a real kind of. And importantly, that it is doing so in the words and in the context that you care about as a property manager, as opposed to just in the world of digital marketing. So happy to share more. I'll sort of consider that my first code of paint for you in terms of, like, where reporting sits and, and kind of where we're headed with the role. So I'm sure you've got questions, happy to field them, and, and if you're willing, kind of park them at the end, but that's hopefully at least an initial view into it.

### You (2025-12-17T23:07:10.425Z)

Good. Good. Sounds good. Yep.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:07:17.465Z)

Cool. And then a bit about me. My role at Digital is as SVP of Product, so I oversee our product organization. I kind of am attached to the hip, to our CTO who oversees engineering. But we're really just one engineering product and design entity. And I've been with Digital for about the last six months. In a full time capacity. I worked as a sort of fractional person for them for the first half of the year. And a lot of what, a lot of what is on my mind these days and what I'm thinking about when I think about the future of digital is what does it mean to be a digital marketing agency in the era of AI, when AI is not just fundamentally transforming things like reporting from kind of readouts to a real form of proactive intelligence, but it's also fundamentally transforming the way that we operate as a business and the way that we fulfill the marketing work itself. And so our ultimate vision for where we're headed is really evolving digital into a much more AI native digital marketing service, where it is not just that intelligence is being proactive in telling you the story of what's happening and what you should do about it, but that's also then feeding back into a system that is itself autonomous to be able to do your marketing.

### You (2025-12-17T23:08:05.225Z)

Y. Ep. Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:08:28.265Z)

So happy to share more on that front in terms of the broader vision, but that's a little bit about kind of where I am and, and what's on my mind these days at Digital.

### You (2025-12-17T23:08:35.065Z)

Sounds good. Yeah. Probably gonna cut off with Wendy. I was. Able to do a really deep dive. Into digital. Like I said, AI can do all sorts of great things, right? So I feel like I know pretty much everything about it at this point. I mean, from an outside standpoint, But, yeah, that makes sense. You know, I understand. You know, creative. Creative agencies have been hit hard by AI so you can either let it walk all over you or you can, you know, whoop it. And. Tame it and put it some good use. So, yeah, I think I definitely understand. Where they are today. And what we need to do. To get that going better.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:09:25.545Z)

Cool. Cool. Awesome. Well, excited to hear that you've been digging in yourself on digital and, and definitely happy to kind of explore that together to sort of shift into phase two, if you will. Would love to now explore and, and get to know you a little bit better and the way that I typically like to do this. Is just kind of talking through your last couple of experiences. And so we've got another hour and 20 minutes or so together. We'll probably spend the next hour, maybe half an hour on one roll, half an hour on another. And I can kind of guide us through a little bit of some of the things that I'm interested in learning about, but I always like to start by just getting a sense of you in your own words. So, as I said, I've gotten on paper version of Howard, but would love to hear in your own words. Just tell me a little bit about yourself.

### You (2025-12-17T23:10:16.185Z)

Yeah, yeah, my pleasure. Really. I've been in commercial real estate. My entire career. And I've been deeply involved in both sides, so actually started off on property operations and asset management. So, you know, very familiar with the whole leasing process. Now, back in the day, I wasn't involved with digital marketing. That didn't exist at the time, but. But, yeah, I've got a lot of roots going back into the industry. And. Then. Back probably around 20202007 is when I first started working in. Prop tech. Where? That's why living in Dallas at the time. And. I was I supposed to Asset management with with PH Measurement Services had a lot of contacts at Real Page. Have a real strong implementation, as you know, analytics reporting type. And so they reached out and asked. If I would be willing to come on kind of subgenre expert. For creating their first central reporting product. Which was if you. I mean, I'm sure you're familiar with RealPage at this point. They are. Rose through acquisition. They don't originate anything. So every single one of their products was very siloed, very. Even though. They were real page products. They were still practically independent businesses inside, so we had to try to break down those silos. Get all that data in there? And we were able to do that. It was a good product. And that's really when I got the tech bug. At that point, so. I was like, joke around saying, you know, I went to the dark side, became working on the vendors operator side and haven't looked back since. Right from the very beginning. You know, reporting and analytics has been pretty much the bedrock of everything that I've done. In prop tech. You know? I've consulted with a company called redlinics, which was very similar to real patients reporting, but they were breaking in data from different property management systems. So help them. Early product. There was just myself among other guy. They eventually sold two real page. They're out there to kind of consolidate. You say we want to talk about last two positions, but. The first physician I would talk to is really kind of. Web page. All rolled up, right? Because I started with Aum. They did not have any type of. Reporting programs, so I was able to build that from the ground up. And put together very strong. Business intelligence platform for energy management. Worked with them for quite a while. Went to another company called National Water and Power, which is a direct competitor of them, and then both were purchased by RealPage. Right, so I'm back at real page. So at that time, right, it was kind of a combination, right? So overseeing the development of the AUM. Business intelligence. Product, but then got rolled into real page, which is this very large organization. But then afterwards, we bought two other companies that were competitors. They were basically buying up all these utility management companies. So while I was there, I also became very involved in integrating all of those platforms into a single platform. Right. So I have 30,000 foot level. The first portion of the first half of my career was landing that utility management analytics reporting. And one of the things the CEO of nwp when I first joined. Know, he basically said, I had just one thing that I need of you. I need you to go find that needle in the haystack. And that was really his way of saying, I don't want you to just put together a dashboard that has metrics. We need to show our users. What's going on? For example. Do you have a leak? Is there a bill that's out of line? So we're looking for outliers and exceptions? And. So from early on, that's really what I've always been focused on, is I don't care about vanity metrics. I don't care. About fancy html5 graphs so they look great. The idea is, if you can't present data. That the user can't use to improve their operations, then you're not providing any value whatsoever. And so when we talked about that, that's really kind of what stuck with me. So consolidating all those platforms into a single platform, very similar to what I was doing the first sign on Real page. But then Covid hit. Right. And at the same time, Tomo Bravo was in the process of purchasing Real Page. So they had a number of consecutive mass layoffs. At the same time Covid hit. So find myself unemployed for about a year. Year and a half. And then I joined Conservis, which is actually the largest multifamily utility billing company. Equal to the world page. Right. That was kind of the step backwards at that point. I kind of went from being the senior product manager overseeing the energy management, utility billing and business intelligence to different product lines that I was overseeing. Had multiple direct reports. Into. I'm not going to say just a product manager, but I didn't have any direct reports. I didn't have anything. But I really love the product we were working on. It was sustainability. The Paris Accord had just happened. And we were trying to come up with ways to get clients to measure their performance against these other products that are out there, the metrics that they have to go. And that was very exciting. But while I was there, I was still poached by rediq, which is my most recent employer. Rediq is valuation model. For multifamily underwriting and acquisitions. And that's where I kind of went back to my asset management days where I was responsible for acquisitions, renovations, that type of activity. And it really is probably one of my favorite jobs. Berkadia was one of the best companies I've ever worked for. They are the largest multifamily broker in mortgage loan servicer in the country. And they owned Rediq, so it was an incredible opportunity with them. And my biggest contribution there is. When I got there, within a matter of weeks, I realized that. The data that they are compiling for an acquisition. Can be used throughout the entire lifecycle of the ownership. Right. So rediq is designed for one purpose, which is to ingest rent roles, ingest financial statements, extract the data, normalize it and then put about where the user can then use it to come up with what they think the properties worth. They either buy the property. Or somebody else buys the property. I'm already. We're done with where IQ until the next deal comes along. So I initiated what we ended up with what we call the lifecycle Management Suite, which allows the user to continue to use RunIQ for the next 3, 5, 10 years, no matter whatever length of time that they own that asset. And that was an exceptionally challenging project. But very rewarding as well. In August of 2024. Brocadius sold it to Radix. Radix is another multifamily data provider. They weren't involved in underwriting or valuation. But I'm going to get too deep into Louise. But we were all Viperia. Not iq, was prohibited from using their outside data. You could only use the data that we gathered. And so that really put. Kind of pretty much come on or kill instead in there. We couldn't do anything outside of that data. What? Radix had the data that we could use, so we thought it was going to be. A match made in heaven. But Radix was unfortunately involved with the real Page class action lawsuit. They basically shut down. Rediq just kept. One junior engineer to keep the lights on. And let everybody else go. They took everybody else. And librated them over to rediq. They had to do a pivot of a full pivot of their product. And so rediq is still out there, still exists, but all of the items that we had on the roadmap were done. So that brought me up to January when they let everybody go there. And since then, I've been working with some other people in the industry, working on some side projects and just kind of taking my time to find the right opportunity. So when I saw the ad for this position and I saw analytics, new product team and abilities to join early and start from scratch, that's one of the things I've been doing in the last few months. Helping with startup. Going with their product. Team, so just checked all the boxes. So that's. That's brought us up to where we are today. So yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:21:31.865Z)

Amazing. Amazing. Well, thank you for letting me walk down your own memory lane and kind of giving me the helicopter. The view of things based on what you shared, I actually definitely doesn't have to be the last two most recent experiences. I think it would be interesting for us to dive into your experience at Real Page and then as a second one from that, I'm happy to either talk about your experience at RedIQ or if you feel like one of the things that you've done in the last year feels more relevant. Some of the startup stuff that you described. Happy to go to either of those, but why don't we maybe spend, like, a half hour or so on Real Page, and then we can. We can see where that takes us. So. Real Page.

### You (2025-12-17T23:21:33.065Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Sounds good. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:22:09.705Z)

I'm pretty familiar. It's an extremely extensive business. I know you joined in 2016, so if you were to describe for me sort of like broad overview of the business at 2016, and then where are you fit into it?

### You (2025-12-17T23:22:11.625Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:22:25.705Z)

Yeah. Help kind of paint that picture for me.

### You (2025-12-17T23:22:27.465Z)

So in 2016, which was when I joined mwp on february 1, and they were bought by ripe on february 10. So big. Basically, they knew what was coming up with the acquisition. It was very interesting. One thing about RealPage is they do have a reputation of being the jack of all trades, master of none. And they still, even at that time, Continued to operate in a very heavily siloed area. But there's a lot of company. A lot of the people that I worked with previously on the Central reporting were still around. So it was nice because I really kind of acted as I was at Liaison. And even prior to. Joining the transition. I spent a lot of time really kind of prepping the NWPT team on what they can expect. With real page. To try to help everybody get familiar with how they work. The real page, what we found. When we got there, they already had their own utility billing company. When they bought at wp. But they reached a really billing company. Was. Really not competitive. With anybody out there. They were. Lagging the entire industry. So clearly winning MWP on board was designed to help them. Catch up to the rest of the industry. They get all the clients that then O had. So it was interesting to be able to get in there. But that also put us at a disadvantage. And I would say that the NWP. CEO. Was very focused on. Showing real page how it's done. When you are purchased by another organization. To go in there and tell them that the way they're doing things is wrong, their culture is bad. They're going to come in, we're going to change. You can imagine that did not go to the Rocktime was really like. At times I felt like I was the negotiator. The ambassador to go between the two, but we were able to navigate that. And able to consolidate. The products. Of course, they had things in their product that were very useful. We had ours. We basically cherry picked the best of each and it was very enjoyable. And that continued. Then when we bought a Roman board, then there was another company called Lucy that was brought on board. It was basically each of these companies. Whether. Known for certain aspects of the business. And so by going and bringing them all into consolidating them, trying to put them on a single platform, et cetera. It was a very interesting experience. So over that period of time, from2016 through2020, Most of the time, I would say actually less new products. Than it was on making the processes that we have more efficient. So if you take a look at my resume, there's all sorts of things on there about cost reduction and putting things in there. And that's really where it came from because we started to get way more scale than we ever had. So of course, we could renegotiate contracts. Almost all of those organizations. Were still processing invoices in house, scanning and OCR and different processes. One of the major projects that I worked on was getting them all on edi. And giving that data shipped directly from the utility companies and not having to go through all the scanning and OCR and everything else. And that was a huge advantage, not only with making the accuracy of the data. Better. Speed is. Unbelievable. You're not waiting to get on an envelope that you have to open up. We have a strategic partnership with nwp, with a company called CAS Systems. And they are the nation's largest utility bill processor, as well as other industries, not just utilities. But they literally had a process where it was mechanical. You get a bunch of mail, it goes in there. There was a little machine that slices the envelope open, another one that takes the paper out, and then they were so proud of this. It should be right. Back in the day, that was a great way to do it. But we were able to wean ourselves off that. And go to way more economical process than what we had, and I think it would have been very difficult to do that. If we were smaller. So going through that process. Of acquisitions. Leading teams into becoming one team and not for opposing teams. Making the process way more efficient than we had. The accuracy was unbelievable. So, of course, We had clients that were rabid fans of who they were and when they're bought by Real Page, some of them canceled their contract and went somewhere else. So not only were we dealing with these internal, but we also had to deal with the external clients. And that was something else that I was able to help with. Having come from that side of the business, I mentioned that I was with PH Management Service. At the time, I was. The largest portfolio in the country. To go. Online with a fully automated energy management product. So I had very in depth knowledge from the user side as well as from the vendor side. And so I spent a lot of time working with these clients that were uncomfortable. We had a meeting with a client services team, making sure we were keeping up to date. And the companies that were not doing very well. I was very actively involved with the client services team to help them navigate through some of the objections that they had. So by the time 2020 rolled around, We had a very strong organization. I was getting a little burnout, though, because one thing that happens with real pages, when they buy a company, they keep the company running. So I was probably three weeks out of a month. Either in Minneapolis, Costa Mesa, Dallas for their home office, Atlanta. I mean, all these different places where these other companies were based. Getting to a point where I kind of had to either scale back. So when the layoffs came, I was actually kind of relieved. I hate to say that, because it was a great company. But it had been such a strenuous four years, at times feeling like you're the rope in a tug of war. Getting all these people asking, what do I do? Well, I heard cats was my job. Cat hurting at that time. But when I looked back on it and I see where we were in 2016 to what we were in 2020, It was night and day. I mean, you could never look at one or the other and think that at one point they were always. Discombobulated pieces lying all over the place. So hopefully that answers your question. A long, drawn out answer. I hope that's what it comes down to, that four year transition.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:31:28.265Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-12-17T23:31:36.425Z)

There.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:31:39.465Z)

Yeah. No, super helpful. And I would love to click in on a few parts. So I think one thing that I want to make sure that I'm understanding well is the product that you took over was a sort of business intelligence for utility management. Helped me understand how did that sort of drive. Was that something that assess like subscription, that drove revenue for the business? How did that fit into the business overall?

### You (2025-12-17T23:32:00.745Z)

Yes. Yes. Yeah. So utility management in multifamily is basically when the properties are outsourcing. The bill payment. And utility management. If you live in a partner community, most of the time, you're going to get a bill for logic and water. And that's what they did. So those days come from real Page or conservatives or someplace else. So it's a data processing. Data is the core of everything. So they get the bills from utility provider. They take the data that's on that bill? And then they take the resident portion of that bill, the part that's not allocated to the clubhouse or the pool, the business areas. And then they allocate it amongst the residents, and there's different ways of doing it. And so when they send it, actually, we'll send out the bills to the resident. And it kind of gives the appearance that. The utility bills are coming from a utility company, and it kind of cuts the apartment community out of the loop. They don't have to deal with angry residents. Anything else? So you're providing a financial benefit? By taking on that billing. It has a huge impact on the bottom line. Right? Because then we have a $10,000 utility bill. And 8,000 of that can be billed back to the residence. So their actual expense is only 2,000, right? Prior to that, they were on the hook for 10,000. So in lieu of raising rents, they were, you know, it was really a huge expense reduction process. So the area that I oversaw was basically everything having to do with the data. The back end. So I wasn't involved with the allocation of the residence, mailing out the bills, collecting money from the residents on the front end. So everything had to do with extracting that data. From an invoice, whichever process was used, going into the database, using that database, then for creating these reports and analytics. And clearly the idea there was to find that needle in the haystack or what is causing these issues. If you see a spike in utility billing. Is it? Is there a leak on the property? Did they just replace the meter? And the new meter, it changes it. So there's all sorts of things we could do. And so that's where I focused the design on these analytics. Well, it's not just to show. Yeah. We process 5,000 invoices this month. So what? Don't tell me anything. I don't care how many millions of. Dollars were spent on your electric bills. I'm looking for that wrong invoice, that time of the little piece of paper where my usage went from 5,000 gallons to 10,000 gallons. Why? Because a lot of times. These utilities are a property are their largest expense outside of property taxes. And so dealing with large numbers. You know, a good sized property between their electric, gas, water, everything, 10, $12,000 a month. So if you have a bill. That was. $150 last month. And it's $500 this month. You'll never notice. You're totally. Dollars can go down, right? And so it's like, oh, my utility bills are going down one way or not. You had no bill here that tripled or something like that. And that's really where we kind of focused on getting that type of information. And of course, along with the sustainability. And we worked pretty much all of the major companies were clients of one of the four. So, of course, when we consolidated, everybody, we worked with all of the largest companies, property management and owners in the industry. And so to be able to surface those anomalies was a big win. It was very rewarding to do that.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:36:44.265Z)

Yeah. I mean, super interesting to kind of hear the specific problem within that space of broader utilities that you guys were focused on. Tell me a little bit about it. Sounds like the CEO. I think it was. The CEO came to you and was like, it's really finding the needle in the haystack. That's like. The core and most important problem that we want to solve. Tell me a little bit about what the relationship was with the CEO and how you guys collaborated to set direction or and if there were any other major sort of stakeholders involved in that process.

### You (2025-12-17T23:37:12.345Z)

Yeah. No, I had a really good relationship with the CEO. And of course, he was the CEO that I mentioned that kind of went in like the wild, wild west. We're going to change everything here. But he very smart person. And we had some great conversations, and I was already doing some of that with the data that I put together at aum. And so it was basically taking what I'd already done for the last couple years and then having the resources and the team available. To really take it to the next level. Anyone was a very small company. We had fewer than 100. My database analyst was one of the former founders. So we and I worked together on these. But he was very proficient in database management, creation, everything else. But he wasn't a data scientist and so we didn't have the resources at the time. That RealPage has rippled, has the huge data science team, brilliant group of people, and we had all these different resources available. To us that we didn't have before. So, you know, actually, we'll see. I kind of teamed up and went around and met with some of these other groups and tried to put together kind of this core group of experts. Into. What can we do? How can we normalize all this data? You know, YouTube. One company with a bill for water is in gallons. My usage was 10,000 gallons. Another utility bill might measure what they call K gallons or thousands. So that'll just say 10, right? So number, but, you know, they can change all the time. So we were able to work really well through existing data science team as well as others. Making sure we had everything normalized. All of the data was as clean as we could possibly get it. And go from there. Something that even if NWP didn't get purchased by Real Page, we wouldn't have been able to do that. So I think he and I both saw the same opportunity now that we were with that organization that we weren't able to do before. So.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:39:51.545Z)

Cool. Makes sense. So I want to be mindful. I think we'll spend another. Just five minutes here and then would love to move into the next area. But if you were to. If I were to talk to your. I don't know who your manager was. I don't know if it was the CEO or somebody else. But if I were to ask your manager what they felt your biggest strength was in your biggest opportunity area at that role, what do you think they would tell me?

### You (2025-12-17T23:40:18.585Z)

They would say my industry knowledge. Is good and bad. Right. There's a lot of people out there who think product managers and these type of people. Should come from different industries. They can learn the industry that you're in. And go from there. And then there's others who feel that product managers who have that deep industry connection. Do better. And I really think in this case, That was true because. I was able to. Empathize with our clients. To the point where nobody else really knew what questions to ask. Didn't understand. Why are they asking us to do this? That doesn't make sense. Well, yeah, it does make sense, but you just don't get where they're coming from, right? So that was definitely the thing. That. Would. Bear bhr. I was Howard Berends Imagine the confusion that we had to do with that, right? But yeah, I will flow to fact that when I was interviewing with them, in reaching out to them, that was a huge factor in having them ask me to join their company as well. Because they knew the relationships that I had and the history that I had in the industry, and they felt that that would be beneficial to them. And it turned out to be. Personally, I think the same was true at rediq and the other companies that I've been with. What iq they didn't have anybody in their product team that had ever acquired a property. Or done all that work. Right. So I've always kind of been that liaison between the clients. Especially engineers, developers. That's really one of the areas that I think I'm really strong in is being able to. Translate. What are the clients asking for? And to the engineers. Explain why we're doing things. I've seen a lot of companies out there, a lot of product managers who don't explain the why. They put together the PRDs, they put together the requirements, they hand off the documents, and they expect two weeks later to have a working product. And the engineers half the time. Don't know what questions to ask. And so that's really, I think, probably what helped the most. Definitely would be what that would be. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that would be the response that you would get from Howard.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:43:17.465Z)

Got it. And if I were to ask how are kind of your biggest opportunity growth area, what do you think Howard would say?

### You (2025-12-17T23:43:22.585Z)

I was very rude to product management. Right. So I knew the business. And I knew what products they wanted to have. I had no idea what a sprint was with Aul. It was not myself and one of the founders. We would just work on what needed to be worked on. And just deal with that. But when I got to MWP and especially Real Page, where they had little product management the first year I was a student of product management and I would say that if you ask him, that would be the response he would have as well. But somebody that I knew for quite a while prior to this, and he was very knowledgeable in product management. One of the better ones that I've worked with in the past, and he was a great mentor. And was able to bring me up to speed very quickly. I think I probably advanced a lot further with him than I would have with most other product managers that I've worked with.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:44:35.465Z)

Amazing. Cool. Well, then let's move into a more recent experience and I'll maybe throw it to you to see whether rediq makes sense. I mean, I'm happy to talk about conservatives as well. I know your time there wasn't as long, or if you feel like one of the more recent opportunities would feel most relevant. I'm curious which one feels kind of most exciting for or relevant?

### You (2025-12-17T23:44:54.985Z)

Yeah, I think what IQ can service. Like I said, they are a direct competitor of what I was doing before. So there was no change between what I was doing. There and conservatives. Right. Well, IQ was where I really made a big change. In the product that I was developing.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:45:16.745Z)

Cool. Amazing. So let's talk about Rediq. So you gave me some context before, but if I'm placing sort of like, here's the overall business, here's how who their customers are and how they make money, and then here's how I fit into that picture, just draw that out for me.

### You (2025-12-17T23:45:25.945Z)

Sure. All right. Yeah. So took me back to my asset management days where I was involved with acquisitions, renovations. And just basically budgeting, forecasting and valuation to sell. So there's really numbers. Of type of product that. We were building there. As I mentioned, we run by Berkadia Berkadia purchased them to become an in house tool. They were able to maintain their existing clients. So we never a fully in house tool. We were servicing both the internal needs and our existing external clients which included JLL and Dunlop and major competitors to Berkadia. These guys were awesome. Huge nationwide brokers of multifamily and we used to call them the industries worst kept secret. That these guys were still with were like you, even though they're Katie owned. It, but that really caused some interesting. Situations. Shall we say when we got there? So as I mentioned, when I joined, I immediately noticed the opportunity to go into this brand new product, really with the Lifecycle Management Suite. But what we had to do is we had to fight. The politics on being owned the Bipocadia. Where they didn't really have an interest in investing in RedIQ to provide additional services. For potential competitors, right? Or other clients. Not only.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:47:27.865Z)

And is that. Sorry to interrupt. Is like if I were to understand the way that you guys generated revenue. So there's the Berkadia business, which generates revenue their own way, for which this is an internal tool. And then there's the direct, I'm assuming some kind of SaaS or subscription type of revenue that you guys get by. Selling to your clients. Just to give me a sense of order of magnitude, like how is. How big was the sort of SaaS business that you guys were running versus how big was the Berkadia business that you were supporting?

### You (2025-12-17T23:47:42.745Z)

Yes. You wouldn't be able to find it on the balance sheet.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:47:57.465Z)

Wow.

### You (2025-12-17T23:47:57.705Z)

We're talking about. The sale of well apartment. Maybe a couple apartments. The revenue that they would generate from that was probably equal to our annual revenue from rediq, right? In comparison to molecules clients. We were there, the market leader. We were the first in the industry to come up with this evaluation model. We had more clients, but in comparison. It's like almost like comparing the car dealership. To gm. Yeah. So the dealership can be doing really well.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:48:35.345Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-17T23:48:36.745Z)

But when it comes down to comparison to General Motors, you're not going to be able to discern it. So it is.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:48:46.945Z)

And part of the reason why I ask, sorry to interrupt, is like there's a similar challenge we sometimes face at digital, which is like we have this big agency service business, and so there's products that we can build to support that main business. And then we also have some SaaS revenue that we generate on the side. It's higher margin. It's, you know, it has its own benefits, but it's never going to, like, fundamentally change the value of the company. And so thinking about how to invest in one versus the other.

### You (2025-12-17T23:49:05.305Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:49:14.545Z)

Is. Is helpful. So. So when you guys were sort of orienting yourself in the business, did you have an explicit stance of like, we are here to build for Berkadia, or we're here to build for generating revenue, or was it always kind of a dance between the two?

### You (2025-12-17T23:49:30.425Z)

No, we. Actually, my role was always intended to be for our external B2B clients. Right? Because that's where I came from.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:49:42.065Z)

External clients.

### You (2025-12-17T23:49:42.985Z)

Nobody else on the team had the experience to do that.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:49:43.265Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-17T23:49:46.265Z)

At the same time. We did have some product managers that reported to me that were focused. On theirs. In fact, one of the product managers actually worked with the Berkadia product team. And came over to the RedIQ team specifically for some of those projects that we had that involved both products. So there was always that pressure for revenue to provide products and services for the intern team. But they also knew that we had a really good business externally. And so it's not like we were orphaned or ignored. We just had to differentiate the two. I think when the challenge came is a very large organization. They had nine product teams. Two hour one. They were a sulfagile shop. They were very slow to move. It was very linear. Right. Product manager starts to buy Rolling Heavy dawn, that goes to the architect, and so on and so forth. And they were trying to make us fit into that. Mold. And I think that's one of the first things that I did is I kind of came in there. And really. Carefully. Made sure that I had to get them to understand that we are going to be with external clients and we can't go through this long drowned out linear process to get features out. And so I worked very closely with the CPO and all of the other teams. To come up with what we called the Four Horsemen, which is really product led, right? We were able to convince them that what works for them does not work for rediq. And I think what helped me along was some of our competitors literally leapfrogged us in terms of their products. They jumped onto AI way faster than we did. We could not use an external AI tool strictly prohibited from. Going to an outside source. And we had to fight these little battles, but eventually we got it to the point where we did not have to follow that linear program. So with this product led, obviously, instead of the product manager starting off well, the product design, architect, engineering, all working almost from the very beginning, right? Getting everything out, so we weren't able to make huge improvements in how quickly we could get things out. Instead of being honest a lot of our organization, we were able to become product led in a very short amount of time. Like the lifecycle management suite that I had that was a huge epic that was made up of five or six different, smaller features in there. They wanted to build on five or six before moving on to the market. We couldn't do that. I think what can be honest there was the fact that. I worked very closely with these other teams, and rather than you guys are doing it wrong, we've collaborated quite a bit. To the point where they even picked up some of the processes that rediq implemented at the time to help their process. So that was as big of a challenge for me as it was to develop these additional product lines that we were going through. But I don't think there's any magic function, no pixie bus that you can throw out there to make it all work. When you're in an organization and you are a smaller revenue stream than the others. You have to increase that revenue stream or work with the best thing to see. Educate them on the benefits. Why should they invest in these? What will they get out of it? And a lot of times it just comes down to roi. And financially, how can I justify this? We're not just making the shiny new object that people will love. It's got to bring revenue. It's got to be profitable. If you can communicate them and show that usually you can be pretty successful.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:54:45.025Z)

Yeah. Well, I'm curious to hear a little bit about the kind of financial impact that you guys had. So when you joined and started at rediq, what was. What did revenue look like?

### You (2025-12-17T23:54:55.705Z)

The revenue. It's very difficult. I'm going to steer you away from that because the revenue is tied directly to the investment lifecycle. Or the investment. I should say environment, not the lifecycle. All real estate is cyclical, right? And different types of real estate are cyclical. What we found. What happened with Covid was. Anything that was residential. Just tanked. Anything that was more infrastructure. The way our houses all these different types went through the roof. So since we only service multifamily, our revenue followed the market. Right. So then we had a question like that. I can't say that our revenue increased 5% a year because it didn't. But what it did do is soften the blow, right? So by bringing in these additional products, in the long run, our clients. Mid size. I mean, yes, we do have institutional clients that I can probably count them on both hands, whereas our tool. Was geared more towards the mom and pops. And the mid size companies that don't have the in house. Bandwidth. Or means of developing their own models. So they would subscribe to our SaaS product, and they would do that. So the revenue did not decline anywhere near what we marketed. But if you take a look at the number of transactions that they were underwriting, just the core feature. When we were processing around. 150,000 rent rolls a quarter. And that dropped on to almost 50,000. So by that, you would kind of think, oh, well, then they were obviously only making 30% of what they were doing. But we didn't. Our revenue only dropped to about 60%. Because of the additional items, the additional features that we were able to add on, and it was still Percy. Pricing. But we were starting to introduce. Add ons at the time, so this is brand new to the sales team as well. They were just used to going out and saying, hey, you can use our product. It's $251 a month per seat. That's it. Now they have to say, okay, now we have this additional revenue or this additional feature here that you can subscribe to. Get this and this and that. So that was really kind of what helped soften the blow there on the revenue side.

### Guest (2025-12-17T23:58:03.585Z)

That. Yeah, that makes sense. So I'm curious to learn a little bit about some of the kind of key value that you feel like you added to customers. So it started as this underwriting tool with an algorithm to figure out valuations you guys were moving down the lifecycle chain into once you've bought. The property. Here's things that you can kind of do with this product. Tell me a little bit about what that how that product evolved and extended.

### You (2025-12-17T23:58:24.265Z)

The main value of that product is time. Right. So since we can essentially just drag and drop these documents, Going through our processor, which was combination of machine learning. AI ocr, different types of mechanics that we had to extract that data. Whereas without us, they literally have to copy and paste. So if I'm an investor who is looking to buy a property, I will get a big package of documents from the seller. From the broker. The only way they have to go through all these different financial students. They might have 10 years of financial statements. They would have to go to each one copy of out of theirs, probably in the model, et cetera. So first off, we saved them an awful lot of time. And in that business, it's all about, how many deals can I look at. Because I want to find that perfect deal before you do. Right. And so if I can process that information, Faster. If I can get that information in front of me in 30 minutes instead of three days, I'm definitely going to have a head start over what you would if you're still doing the manual. The value there was really how quickly and accurately we can extract the data and then present it to you so that you can continue with the other factors that are involved in. What kind of financing all these different things that you can get. And then, of course, that was strictly for the investment portion, right? When we transition over to lifecycle management suite. We were getting them engaged every month. So for every property that they had. They would upload the Batmobile's financial statement. And continue. So we were processing more documents, getting more revenue just Simply from getting one financial statement for an acquisition to 12 a year per property. And so that was a tremendous boost there. What we were working on. Prior to the sale is also when being able to take that aggregated data. We did a couple of different things. First, the very first thing that we released was what we call below noi. So the financial statement for acquisition only goes down to. The net operating income, which is just basic level, minus expenses, right? But in account we'll tell you a bit below the noi is all your capex debt services a lot of different lines below that. So the first thing we had to do is work on the back end and expand that down below. That was a feature that a lot of the users had been asking for for years. As part of their underwriting, but our team didn't understand why. And why would we want to do that you only need to be in the line type thing? And so that was one of the very first things I was able to work on there. Then the next one was what we call the performer versus actual. So if I'm uploading this data every month, I can then compare my profile or would I buy a property? A budget. Right. If I'm projecting out, that's what the performer is. And it could go for 3,005, seven years out. So I can bring in that actual data every month and then compare it to my original owner writing. And so if there's any corrections that need to be made or anything like that, they can tell right away. And then the next one that we did was the aggregated data. And this was the big item out there. Because when you are a rediq client, you can opt into sharing your data. If you opt into sharing your data, you can then take a look at our anonymized and aggregated data for particular area. And what we did is we would create basically gog rails, right? So we would say, okay, for this market, for this particular line item on your financial statement, whether it's rather expense. Here's the level of the high and the average. And as long as they're within that, they're fine. If they go outside of those guardrails, they need to reevaluate their assumptions, and that kind of goes to that needle in the haystack, right? Prior to that, there was no such thing as a deal in the haystack. You just upload your financial statements, et cetera, and it is what it is. So that's one of the others that was really big. And then at the same time working with the data science team to put together some demographic which also included risk wellness. So depending on where the asset is located, Incidentally, on earthquake, fire zone, all these different things that went together so that by the time we got all of those features out, they had a full 360 degree view of the properties, as well as the ability to locate and identify certain areas that they have to fix if they're not performing where they expect. It to be those goggles that we put up. So that's. Really detailed answer to your question. But did that answer your question, or is there any information that.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:04:30.845Z)

Yeah. Yeah, that's great, I think. Gives me some good detail. On some of this that you built while you were there. I'd love to hear a bit about. Of the things that you built there, what do you feel was the most impactful, whether it was feature or product and sort of how did you know that it was the most impactful?

### You (2025-12-18T00:04:49.065Z)

Yeah, I think that's kind of where I'm heading with that other answer, too. The demographic data, the point where we were able to provide, number one, this feature that had been asked for for many years before I even joined. And number two, the ability for them to quickly and immediately identify. Where someone, their unwriting assumptions might be out of line. You know, they might be underwriting taxes way lower than what the actual taxes are in an area. And to be able to pinpoint that out. So from a client standpoint, that was definitely. The most impactful. But at the same time. I worked very closely both with the data science team and the engineering team to improve the accuracy of the data extraction. A lot of what they did on the data extension side, particularly on Red Rose, was more rules based than anything else, right? So if a client uses real page. And they sell this a real page rent roll. We know that your columns are going to be the same. Your data is going to be the same. Fairly simple to extract that data. But real Page and everybody else. They'll make changes to it. And if they upload it that way, Even if it's just a column header was abbreviated or anything like that, it would kick it out. So for the last probably six months before it was sold to Radix, And then even after Radix acquired us, we continued to improve it, but we made some huge improvements in the overall accuracy. And of course, if I'm a user and I upload a Red Bull, I'm expecting to see my data in about a minute. And when I get a message saying, we're unable to process this red role, which typically we had an offshore when that happened, the red roll goal is the offshore team, they manually extract it, put it in. There's some inconvenience to the user because our service terms will give it to you within 24 hours. Usually it didn't have to take that long, but instead of one minute to be able to continue going. All of a sudden. They have to go and start working on another deal or something else while they're waiting for us. Financially bringing any additional revenue. But from a user satisfaction standpoint, that was also a huge win for us when we were able to bring up that success rate significantly.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:07:42.045Z)

Got it. Got it. Makes a lot of sense. You talked about kind of one of the biggest challenges was in dealing with the sort of serving two masters between the internal team of Berkadia and the external clients of RedIQ. I'm curious who your most difficult stakeholder was that you had to work with through this and kind of how you engage them.

### You (2025-12-18T00:08:05.625Z)

That's a great question. We had some really good team members. That we had. From the C suite in Berkadia. We never really got any pushback. On any of the initiatives that we had, but because the market was declining. And, of course, doing business in seven apartments and servicing the mortgage. Right. So when the market tanked, it really affected them more than reflected us. So it wasn't so much of trying to convince stakeholders. It was just the fact that we had to do less with or do more with less. Right. Just like everybody else out there. But internally we probably had some. Issue. I wouldn't say issues with particularly the lead engineer, who was very black and white. Right. There was no in between. It even did this or didn't. Be able to explain it to her and to get things done the way it needs to be done was. Was very, very challenging, to the point where my immediate supervisor refused to work with her. It was interesting to work with. So I kind of, by default, had to work with her. And I would say after a few months, she and I had a great working relationship. It was just kind of like back to that situation where I mentioned before that all she wanted to do is, number one, why are we doing something like this? What's the business value? And. Number two have a voice and how it's done. So when we were able to wean ourselves off that safe, agile and go into that four horse, She was a different person. I would say that from a difficulty standpoint, that would probably have been the primary one. There.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:10:23.805Z)

And just to make sure that I'm kind of tracking. When you said her thinking was very black and white, and that was the big challenge. Could you kind of give me a little bit of color and opun intended on. On what that looked like?

### You (2025-12-18T00:10:35.065Z)

Honestly, I think a lot of it was cultural. She was an immigrant from China. We talked about their education system and the way that they're taught is very strict. It's golden class. You do this. There's not a lot of discussion outside of that, and I just really think it's the way she was trained. So when she got here, I think she had a hard time acclimating to the difference between what she was used to back in China compared to how we did business here. And I really think she and I would have very long conversations. And the first five or ten minutes might be related to a project, a lens, whatever. Trying to explain to her, why do we do things around here? How are things done? Not necessarily talking about that specific project. But I've never bluntly asked her, why are you being so difficult?

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:11:47.165Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-12-18T00:11:53.225Z)

Not something that other people have done, but I didn't want to do that. But, yeah, I think after I got to know her, I think it became pretty apparent that that was probably the reason.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:12:07.885Z)

Got it. Got it. Awesome. Well, last question. And then as promised, we can take about 15 minutes to use it however you'd like. So, same kind of question as in the previous one. If I was to talk to your manager at in this role and ask them, biggest strength, biggest opportunity, what do you think this person would say?

### You (2025-12-18T00:12:27.865Z)

She was my biggest fan. My biggest supporter. So Nancy was the senior vice president of product management at rediq. She had no product management experience. It was interesting. When I got there, she was a project manager. And specializes also in change management. So when I got there, I don't think. We had any conflicts. But there's clearly differences of opinion in why we do something. And. She actually wasn't very technically proficient. I love roadmap. Tool was PowerPoint right? She wanted lessons how to work in. Know how to log into Jira or Ado or any of those others. But. It got to the point where we realized that as a team, we were extremely well. Worked well together. She handled the minutia. I mean, she could keep all these meetings and line, know exactly what's going on. Was working very well with the Berkadia team as well. Whereas I handled just the actual product management duties. So I ended up taking care of the roadmap and the quarterly planning and all these other things. So as a team worked well, I don't know. I've kind of got to where we realize that it was just a great combination. And when Radix was sold, she was. Not part of the team that went with Rediq. There was just a handful of us. So it was very disappointing that we weren't able to work together. But if you wanted to reach out to her, she would tell you that as a team, we complimented each other very well. I come with her like I did with our engineering. Kind of coached her along on just the pure product management part of the job and made sure she understood why. Are we doing something? Making sure that we have everything aligned. And so I would encourage you to call if you want to talk to a reference. She would be my first choice. But, yeah, it was an interesting dynamic that we had between the two of us.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:15:19.485Z)

Amazing. Awesome. Well, appreciate you kind of letting me pok and prod and explore different parts of your experience as promised. Happy to take the last 15 minutes to use however you'd like, answer questions, we can just chat whatever you feel called.

### You (2025-12-18T00:15:24.185Z)

Sure. I think that the first one is the easiest one, is how is product. Being managed now. I did look up here. LinkedIn profile, of course. Saw your history of going into early startups and getting things going, but they also had product management before you joined in June. What are you doing in terms of Is this an organization wide initiative and that you're trying to get things aligned or could you explain more about that?

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:16:12.125Z)

Yeah, Great question. So let me maybe outline a little bit about how digital is shaped to where I fit into that and then where product specifically drives. So digital is, at its core, a digital marketing agency. And so the core services we offer to clients are in the digital marketing space, which means a big part of our organization is built up of operators in the world of marketing. So we've got client service folks who engage with our clients. We've got paid media experts, organic experts. They're doing SEO, they're doing paid search. So we've got a big part of the organization, probably two thirds, is sort of dedicated to our agency services. And then let's just say one third is sort of the technology side of the business. So that's product management, design and engineering. And we oversee both some products that are external facing so we sell directly to clients and then we see product we oversee products that are internal facing so that our agency team uses in order to fulfill our client services team uses in order to deliver value to our customers. And so product management has existed for some time at Digital because there are existing products that we've built that are driving revenue and their existing products that we've built that are used internally. And so what I am, the organization that I'm overseeing is really. Let me think about a way to articulate this, at its core, about driving digital's evolution into the world of AI native marketing. So how does digital transform in the coming years in response to the fact that agentic AI is disrupting basically every job on earth, but certainly jobs that are heavily manual or intensive or people heavy and very operationally costly. And so in simple terms, the sort of too big layers to that are intelligence. So what is the way that we are leveraging data and artificial intelligence and, you know, whether it's pure simple analytics or, you know, more sort of AI native intelligence, What are the way that we're leveraging technology to better understand how things are performing and where there's opportunity so that we can improve performance. And then the second big layer is asking, how do we leverage technology to actually transform the way that we execute and fulfill our marketing in the first place? And so today, product management is a. Well, it's a very small team that we're trying to hire into. We have 1pm on the team right now, so we're trying to hire at least two more, this being one role. And those pms will basically oversee three respective large areas of reporting and marketing intelligence, and then within that sort of autonomous fulfillment, somebody who's overseeing the paid side of it. So how do we think about the evolution of paid marketing and then the other, which is in the organic space. So how do we see the evolution of things like content generation and organic marketing in the world of agentic AI. So that transformation is one that we are in the early stages of driving as an organization, and I'm basically leading that transformation. So at its core, what where technology has sort of sat as a supporting entity to the agency organization, what we anticipate over time is that the lines between these two will start to blur and technology will sort of integrate itself into the agency.

Makes perfect sense. So one of the things I was going to ask or actually show. Do you mind if I share my screen? A minute. Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-12-18T00:19:56.205Z)

Yeah.

I guess one of the things I want to find out is if. I'm on track in terms of what it is that the digital sorry is looking to do here. We've talked about. What did I do in the past? What are some of the needle in the haystack type thing? So I whipped up. A prototype here. It's just a mockup, right? This took me probably about an hour. To put together, but what I wanted to do is kind of take a look at what. My philosophy is what I can have done and doesn't align with what you're looking for. So one of the things I've talked about. Is showing actionable items, right? So you've got some portfolio cards up here, KPI cards. You've got a good shows, you'll realize your occupancy. How do they perform? Period over period? You got a mother that takes that and then adds a 12 month trend, so you can kind of get to look there and then you've kind of got a best here. And one of the things there is taking a look at how can I drill down. So, for example, the portfolio occupancy. Now I can click on that. I can see information here. Standard dashboard stuff. I'm not looking for any oozing OZ here, but when I've been working on with this other startup that I've mentioned before, This is actually. A rediq model. For hotels. Right. And. I'm helping get the product team up and running there. At this point they're brand new students. So it's now next later we're not looking know the whole detailed process at this point. But one of the things that I've been working on then, like, for example, this best, of course. AI right. So what was it? The best. Well, you have AI here, who can come in here and provide all these details. That what I put together before? I can have a color code. Right, Here's a red, and you click on the red and it pops up. Here's an invoice, and here's the invoice number. Whatever. What we've got to work with today in AI since it's a game changer here. Right. So here I can tell you what is going on. What are the recommended actions, et cetera? And one of the things that I've accomplished with this startup here is even take it to the next level there. So we've got AI powered insights which we could add here to explain what's going on. But the best thing is. Not just seeing the insights, but. What can I do to fix it? Having this chat. I've got another product that I put together that does very similar. It's one that I put together for personal use. And then we'll go out and do some research, put together an AI generated summary, very detailed, and then a little chat box at the bottom where I can go. And keep going on here. So this is really what I see. I'm going to talk about the layout. I don't care about the bubble charts, the line charts, et cetera. Those are all pretty straightforward. But it's like, what can we do? With getting these additional insights, making sure that we can provide actionable. Tools tell them what to do, not just what's wrong. Now I will admit. Obviously, when I was on the operations side, very into the marketing. But I just made all this data up, right? You might be looking at one of the reasons. What is that? It's all synthetic data. But design in line with what we talk about AI and what you want to do with AI, okay? I just want to make sure. Yeah, I mean, that is definitely. All right. I know close to the end time. But I do have one other question. Then. What about integration with property management systems right now? Is all of the data that you're working with, data that you generate internally. From. The ads. Are you getting any data from the clients that you can merge the two? Yes. All right. Yeah. I might even touch on this much. But I did mention. Right. Let me explain the client that I had years ago that we were bringing in property level detail, phone property management systems. And I've worked with APIs. I actually have a third party that I've worked with that has APIs into all the management systems. Perhaps. I think Robin is very good. With that solutions as well. I don't have the same opinion. Their expertise as I do with. It. It's a struggle. And I think they are struggling with AI as well, because. Making an API now. Is so much easier than it was three years ago. And they're stuck on that. What do they do three or five years ago? Everything's new. Everyone has to be custom made. And that's where run you can get with Propaxola. And it's like, nah. You can hook it up. You just go. All you got to do is get the paper signed and everything else. So, yeah, Berkadia has an incubator program, and he is part of that. So I think I met him probably two and a half years ago. It was a different name at the time. And he had to change the name because of. Some conflict there, but yeah. He's very good at what he does. Interesting. I think it's unique. In that heavenly real page. I know that. There's a lot of customization that the clients can do. Right? They will offer X number of static funerals. And then the ability to start adding your own. And what we're finding is that. A lot of the clients will go out and customize something, even if they don't have to. It's like, okay. You already have a field here that does what you're looking to do. Why would you have to add another one down here? Right. So that's really what prevents a lot of these things. And I found it primary on the utility management side because we had the APIs connected into all of them. But the financial budgeting as well. I helped Page on their budgeting two years ago. And everybody thinks that they've got the right way to do it. Right. My way is the best way. And I call this field xyz. So I'm making an XYZ in one site and yardi or whatever. So that's always a challenge. Is mapping from. Here's what you call it. Here's what we call it. And then they'll change it at some point. It will break. It's nice to give them options, but sometimes it's counterproductive. No. Just based on what we talked about today, do you have any concerns about my background? Or is anything that I need to give you some additional information on. Cool. Okay? I hope to hear. That. Thank you. Very excited about the opportunity, so we'll talk to you soon. All right, thanks.
