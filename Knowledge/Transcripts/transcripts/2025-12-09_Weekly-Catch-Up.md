# Transcript for: Weekly Catch Up

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:01:32.343Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-12-09T15:01:33.223Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:01:34.583Z)

Good morning. Thanks for chatting. I feel like a teenager on the teams. I find myself trying to read too much into it, and so I thought it'd be better for us. To talk. And then I know you want to step back from investing AI over the holidays and to see if this settles and all of that, but I appreciate you taking the time to just talk before we. I guess we kind of, like, put things down until the settlement is reached and the holidays are over and think about a 2.0. If that's something you decide you want to move forward with, so do I. I mean, I kind of have the context correct. Big picture, okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:02:08.423Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not dropping out. But I was. I was really kind of surprised by Vinod. 's email last night. Every time we've spoken, he's talking about doing the same thing. He just wanted to get through the holidays. Take a while to see what happens. And then. Reconvene, but to see him send the email last night that just says I'm done. That was not expected. So, yeah, my original intention, and still my intention, is just to step back. See what alternatives we have. But now, with the node, if. There's no way to convince him to work with us. We are in a really bad place. We just happen to be at the right place at the right time. With Vinod being let go from Radix when I was and he didn't have a job. He and I were talking about starting something on our own before you and I started rediscussing this. So, you know, he was ripe for getting involved with something like this at the right time. I don't know. And this is really what I need to spend the time on is I don't know how we're going to move forward. With out ATEC who's willing to do it for sweat equity. So then the question.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:04:03.063Z)

I do have one idea on that, and I don't know if now is the right moment to bring that up or if you want time to settle. With it over the holidays and come back fresh. But I do have one idea that's kind of resurfaced in my mind, given that we're starting to talk to Mark Woodworth and cbre, and maybe there's a shot at that data I can. I get, but I don't want to overwhelm. Right. I don't. Want to, like, bring this up now. If you're at a point where you just need time and space to settle. And I'm also just trying to understand with the node, is it that he's really out? Because if he's really out, Then is there an opportunity to pay him for the work he's done? Does this make sense and almost be able to affect an orderly transfer of the source code? Or is that out of the question? I mean, I'm just trying to think about things like that, but this might not be the exact moment to think about things like that as well. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like, I'm just. I want to be respectful of you and your time and your space and the Vinod situation. And I. You've had more of the conversations with Vinod, right? So I really don't have a sense if Vinod is. In or out? And how long. Like that process goes on before or just have to think, okay, now I have to figure out or we. Or I mean like an alternative solution without the node. Does that make sense? Like.

### You (2025-12-09T15:05:43.063Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think he's out.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:05:48.903Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:05:49.303Z)

But I don't know that. He? I'm not saying that it can't be salvaged. So that's another reason why I think we just need to take. A step back. Doesn't mean I'm totally off the grid. You know, I want to meet with Mike on a regular basis. You know, if we have more calls with Jessica or Mark, I'm fine with that. But I think we just need to see. How it all shakes out with Mark and Drew. Like I mentioned, I was really surprised on Sunday. When Vinod and I were chatting on teams about this, how resistant he was to do what was being requested. I don't know if he thought I was trying to manipulate him into doing something that he shouldn't. And I kept trying to explain to him that, you know, this isn't our. Doing this is the attorneys, and specifically Jews attorneys with the cease and desist that we got to stop this. You know, I did my best to explain it, but he kept pushing back and pushing back until finally. He went back and he found the email that had the attorney's letter. And a couple minutes later, he said okay. I'll do this. But like I said, one of the very first things in the chat was he didn't want to upset Drew. And I don't know. What he. I mean, I know what he meant by it, but I don't know what was the basis of it. Other than he thought that if he made Drew angry. That they would add him into the letter and make him officially part of this is because right now I think it's perceived as you and me. Against Mark Andrew. And that's the only thing I can think of that he was referring to.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:08:17.063Z)

May I ask a question? Do you think there's a chance that Drew has reached out to Vinod directly about trying to do this with them instead of us?

### You (2025-12-09T15:08:24.503Z)

I didn't want to bring. I didn't want to bring that up, but, yeah, it's a possibility. And the reason why I thought that. Is Finode used the exact same language as what was on the letter. As far as erasing my name from all this stuff, It was overthinking it. But that crossed my mind. As whether or not.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:08:50.743Z)

I crossed my mind as well. I mean, the language that he used last night with a ras. And then just if I were Jerome, that's what I would do. I would reach out to the Node and I mean, it may be Mark's brainchild idea, right? But Drew and Vinod have a good enough working relationship that Drew might be able to convince Vinod that he's the better solution to move forward with on this, that can bring this to market. But I do want to. I mean. Some of the ideas that I'm forming. I mean, let me just be. I have things I have to step back and think about too. Like where am I truly complicit in this situation and what am I going to learn from it going forward? So two of the things that I am really need to think about over the holidays is I moved forward with a five founder team for a reason. I've explained it. I feel like because of the disciplines. Right? But I saw that it wasn't working and I didn't move quick enough to nip it in the bud. And that's on my shoulders. I feel like I needed it. I'm the one that brought the five co founder team together. And when I could see it not working out and when I could see Drew and Mark making kind of crazy demands and the dynamic where I think tolerating Mark sent a message to you and Vinod that it was okay for Mark not to work. I mean, and for you guys to work so hard and for Mark. Not to work was demotivating for people. So that's on me. And it's something I need to think about why I felt so strongly about continuing with the five founder team when I knew it wouldn't work. I also feel like I need to unpack. Why? I just didn't step up into a CEO role. Like, you know, was that. Was I truly just trying to be collaborative, or was there something else at play that I need to learn for us? A 2.0 version of InnVestAI? But I do have. 2 Real Tangible Ideas about how to move this forward without Vinod. If he contributes the source code or if he doesn't contribute the source code. Because the work you did on the proof of concept was a lot of work, Howard. And like you say, the. It's math. Right. The Excel model itself is math. It's the technology and the data extraction, where there's just, I mean, tremendous value. And there is another option out there that has already mastered that data extraction piece that we could think about going to. So I just. I mean, I don't. I'm not. I just. Want you to know that, like, I am really taking time to reflect on this as well and what you know. Like how InnVestAI 2.0. Looks. Leaner, looks smaller. Right. I mean, I'm trying to think about solutions. I value everything that you've done this past year and really want to work with you going forward. But I also understand if you don't want to move forward with this. Right. Because you have other options and this might not be something. That you want to invest more time in. So I just wanted to be able to, like, relay that to you in a real conversation.

### You (2025-12-09T15:12:24.103Z)

Yeah, no, I appreciate that. Yeah, I guess. I guess that's the biggest concern is how can we replace the node or go down a different direction without funding? Right. Like I said, I don't think we're going to find sweat equity. But the thought did cross my mind as well that, okay, what if this relationship with. Mark and his team, do they have somebody that could fulfill that role? Right? So maybe InnVestAI gets merged into their group or something. I don't know if that's what you're thinking or not, but that just came to mind, and I don't know them well enough.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:13:08.743Z)

Well. So let me just put this out there. And I'm not saying this is what we do, right? It's just an idea. And maybe in your downtime over the holidays, research it and think about it. The gentleman, Ali Malu, who is the founder of Otellier. And again, it's o t e l I e r right. Study that founder team and do some research on it. Over the holidays when I was at CBRE, I was very close to CBRE, investing 2 to 4 million dollars into his company at that time. He can process data. He has a software engineering team, he has a security, he has a ciso. He has all the infrastructure in place. That we would need to really accelerate this. He likes the idea of real estate because his wife's family was in the hotel ownership business, so he understands it. And he could be a person we go to and say, let us create a sister platform to Atelier and we'll build out the real estate structure. If we can bring CBREs benchmark data to the table. I think that helps, but I don't know that it's necessarily a no go if we can't. I think he would see the potential and understand like this crazy ARR and tam. Right. Because he just gets it and understands it and is more interested in it.

### You (2025-12-09T15:14:34.663Z)

Good. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:14:47.863Z)

So that's the. That's the one idea, the most tangible idea that I have. The second is, and I don't want to belabor this, but Driftwood has lots of connections as well. So there may be a software engineer somewhere in the mix of their connections that we could try to tap into, right? If we could potentially pay the Node. And I truly mean this. Right. I don't want to steal anything from Vinod, but. No, doesn't want to move forward and doesn't have the risk tolerance for this, which feels a bit like he may not genuinely. Right. Like this. Being a founder isn't easy. It's really, really hard. And it may be something that.

### You (2025-12-09T15:15:16.183Z)

Right. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:15:32.663Z)

Seems interesting and exciting to him. Except when the blows come, you know, like a cease and desist and. But if there's an orderly way to affect the transfer of the source code where he feels good about it.

### You (2025-12-09T15:15:38.983Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:15:47.783Z)

There's. Then maybe we could tap into some of, you know, our industry friends out there and see if they're like, Mark doesn't have a software engineer on his team, but Driftwood could get us to a software engineer or a partner that could help us. So those are the two. I don't. Know, like ideas I have, maybe they're better at the end of the day because it keeps a two founder team. Right. Which I. I've learned a lesson about a five co founder team. Why it doesn't work. So those. Those are just things for you to consider as you're thinking through, like what you want to do and the viability of this going forward.

### You (2025-12-09T15:16:31.863Z)

Yeah, yeah. No, I agree. One of the things that I talked about also, you know, in some of the conversations that we had earlier this week, I mentioned about the. Person that I knew that created a competitive product to rediq.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:16:49.943Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:16:52.263Z)

He and I still talk a lot. And I really did provide a lot of help to him getting this off the ground. He could be a potential partner. Where I. We would probably end up being a client of theirs. But the cost. Would still be less than our overall cost to develop something in house. But his technology that he's using is very flexible. And he's processing multifamily operating statements which are very complex. To create a process to extract data from hotel operating statements. Probably wouldn't be too difficult for him. And I think he would be open to a straight up partnership where, you know, maybe we do some cross selling or something. I mean, that is an option. I'm not going to talk to him yet, but, you know, I think the best thing for us to do is over this break. Do exactly what we're doing now. Do some brainstorming. Just think about different options. You know, I put way too much time and effort into this. I'm not going to just walk away. I. If there's a way to salvage it, I want to salvage. It. But I don't know how that looks. You know, it depends on. What we come up with over the. Over the holidays.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:18:24.423Z)

The other thing about OTE that I just want to mention, and this is true with Profit Sort, but I've just come up empty every time I go to Profit Sword. Plus, they have this strategic relationship with Drew right now. But going back to ote, and that is operators do budgets. And the way they do budgets is almost like a mini underwriting model. It's more detailed, but they use drivers. Now, you know, the ps, the pars, right, the penetration analysis. Like, they have the technology built already to create budgets. And so if we want to atelier, I don't even know that we need the source code because they have a lot of that infrastructure already in place. It's just a matter of taking the lens or the use case. From a budget use case to an underwriting use case. Right. They have the underlying technology. They bought a platform. I don't know, like four or five years ago that was a budgeting platform that had been. It had been under invested in and then they've invested in that to get it almost leapfrogged above profit. Like you talk about Archer, right? That's what's happening with Otelier and. With profit soared, so. I think we. I honestly don't know that we need the source code. If we could convince Ali to do something with us. Right, but that is going to mean a very, very strong, clear.

### You (2025-12-09T15:19:54.983Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:20:01.063Z)

Pitch deck. Go to market strategy, right? Because it's like my uncle says, push and pull. It needs to be small enough that there is a very clear, actionable outcome. If this makes sense, like one core product that gets shipped out in an MVP for testing to clients pretty close to immediately, right? And I think sitting down with them and working for one month with their software engineers to take their budgeting module and almost create an alternative use case for it, that's underwriting is achievable. But then the vision also needs to be big enough that they could see, oh, my gosh, this is like, a really, like, in the end, this could be a really sizable opportunity if executed correctly.

### You (2025-12-09T15:20:50.183Z)

Right. No, that's absolutely a viable option. So. When it comes down to the source code. The only thing that's of any value in that source code is the data extraction from the operating statements. And the model. I still have to prove the concept. It's on my computer. The only thing that the node was doing different. It looked different. Right. He was setting it up for the website. So when it comes down to the actual model, It's, it's. It's mine. I've got it in the proof of concept. And the POC is different enough from what the node put together that they can't make an argument that. That that belongs to them. You know, I'm not worried about that at all. It's different enough from what the node created. That I could stand in front of somebody and say, you know, this is. They're not the same. So if we are able to partner with whoever, whether it be my contact, whether be atelier or somebody else that can extract the data, then we're okay.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:21:59.223Z)

Yeah. And I believe I. I really believe we can. I really believe we can do that.

### You (2025-12-09T15:22:04.103Z)

In my. In my opinion.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:22:08.423Z)

I mean, I. Well, do we go to Ali and get a big fat no. Maybe Your contact sounds like we should consider that after the holidays, right? As a work as customer. But that's going to be the case of a lot of AI, Right. Like we're not going to develop the core AI, we're. Just going to use the AI to deliver workflow automation because we understand the workflows.

### You (2025-12-09T15:22:25.783Z)

Right. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:22:36.983Z)

I also am hopeful about this relationship with Mark Woodward. He is the grand. I mean, like, the hotel industry loves him, and so, like, some sort of branding around him would be really, really good.

### You (2025-12-09T15:22:40.343Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:22:54.343Z)

But. So where do we end? I mean, I. Where do we end this? So you. If there's settlement conversations, we'll have those with Sherben. I'm concerned that their attorney. It's been a week since they're. I mean, almost a week since we sent that response letter, and I mean. Do you have any concerns about that? Like their view is just drag it out because they can get the note on their side and know that. It could potentially.

### You (2025-12-09T15:23:20.023Z)

I, I, I, I don't know. Yeah, it's, it's possible. I don't. I don't know if having been note on their side. Changes anything, Although I don't. I don't know, it might. Yeah, I. I don't know. I mean, we basically. Complied with their request, didn't we? I mean, we didn't push back or say no to anything. I think they want. I think might maybe want some clarification on a couple things, but. Or maybe he was just waiting for the confirmation that Vinod did what we asked him to do. I don't. I don't know. I haven't seen any reply back to your posts on the team's chat, so.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:24:07.623Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:24:09.783Z)

But, yeah, I mean, let's just. Let's just keep conversation going with Mike, who can use the teams chat.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:24:09.943Z)

So.

### You (2025-12-09T15:24:15.783Z)

You know, if he wants to get on a call, I will be available for that. You've already cleared the calendar of all the team calls, which is fine. Anytime you want to have a one on one. Just let me know and we can do that. You know, if there's. If there's something you want to discuss, like if you've had conversations with somebody and you think you're making progress, that would be great. You know, so I'm not.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:24:44.503Z)

I'm not going to reach out to Ali until. I mean, even if, like. Well, first is I'm not going to do anything with. Without alignment, right? So that's the first thing. So I wouldn't reach out until I have alignment, and that alignment may come.

### You (2025-12-09T15:24:52.343Z)

Yeah. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:24:58.743Z)

After you. You know, make the decision if you want to move forward with this or don't, based on the outcome of the settlement and things like that.

### You (2025-12-09T15:25:04.023Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:25:07.543Z)

But. And I have to, actually. If we decide to reach out to Ali collectively. Right. Or if you decide to take a step back and not do this. I need to have good pitch deck materials. I can't pitch without the actual materials that I need. And I genuinely believe that Mark and Drew hurt my ability to.

### You (2025-12-09T15:25:23.063Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:25:28.743Z)

To kind of get a pitch duck, right? To actually finalize a pitch deck. They just sat on it for so long because they didn't want to raise capital. I believe that in Mark's mind, that was part of it. Why does he need a pitch deck if he's not going to go raise capital? He's going to try to bootstrap the whole thing, right?

### You (2025-12-09T15:25:43.463Z)

Right. Right. Yeah. Y. Eah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:25:48.903Z)

So that will be another thing that they. I mean, if Mino decides he wants to partner, is Mark and Drew feel very strongly against any kind of fundraising and dilution. And so, I mean, it was never my intention for everyone to work for free. Kind of like my uncle said when we were talking to him. It's. It's not an easy thing. You want to avoid dilution, but the practicality of people working that long without pay is just not realistic in this world. Unless you're independently wealthy like Mark. Right. And have two homes and things like that, but. But, I mean, it was never my intention was to raise capital so that we could cover everyone's, you know, bare, minimal living costs. And I feel like the market, Drew, really hurt my ability to create the material that we all needed to go do that. Now. Now I'm a bit freer to sit down and with my uncle's help, I believe, like, if I can convince my uncle and he can understand the strategy, that I've made it crystal clear to people that might not get it immediately. Does that make sense? Like, I think I. I have a good. What is the word I'm looking for? Like, test case. Right. With my uncle. Like, if I can lay this out, in a way he gets it, then I have a streamlined message that I can go out and talk to people about it.

### You (2025-12-09T15:27:16.183Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you and I both talked about the. The pitch deck that they created is way too much. Way too much. You're gonna lose people's attention after three or four slides. They put way too much information in there. So I, I don't I, I, I, I'm kind of glad. That we're not going to use it, and I have to start all over again. Yeah, it's a lot of work, but, you know, you and I have been trading messages and articles.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:27:47.463Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-09T15:27:54.503Z)

And different things that say, you know, what should. What should not be in there, how much detail, you know, what to leave in, what to leave out. And I just really don't think that they're pitch deck. I mean, they wanted to share every detail of everything going on, and it was just. In my opinion, not too good. And, yeah, I agree, your uncle is. I was very impressed. And I think he will be able to help really pinpoint what we say. So we're not just throwing against the wall to see what sticks. We're focused. I think that'll be very, very helpful.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:28:34.823Z)

Clear, concise message, right?

### You (2025-12-09T15:28:35.463Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:28:37.543Z)

Yes. So, okay.

### You (2025-12-09T15:28:37.783Z)

Yeah. So. All right. I think. I think we're good. You know, like I said, I'm not. I'm not out. In all transparency. I am actually interviewing for two different positions right now. Neither one of them would prevent me from continuing with this. Of course, one. One of the jobs I think would be pretty intense. And would probably. Really limit the amount of time I can work on it to, you know, maybe evenings and weekends, at least for a while. The other one is is interesting. And they, they are a four day work week. So, you know, I would have, you know, pretty much the entire day, Friday, all weekend, plus, plus evenings. I'm further along on the first one. I've already had a couple different interviews. Tomorrow is actually. Yeah, tomorrow is actually my first one.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:29:32.983Z)

Good for you.

### You (2025-12-09T15:29:37.063Z)

But you know what? It's weird. You know, I had another opportunity a month ago. I went through five different interviews, and, you know, it's just like. Then they say, you know, we decided to go on with somebody else. Which is unusual because I had. I checked every single box off on there, and just like you and I've talked about this before, I think maybe when you're no longer having a phone interview and you're actually having a video interview and they see the loose skin and the wrinkles and, you know, oh. Yes. You're double the age of the person you're talking to. I mean, there's no denying that's. That's part of it. So.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:30:23.703Z)

Know age discrimination is real. My uncle's going through it right now too. Right. Which is. But there's. But then I don't know. I guess that's why I feel so strongly about InnVestAI It's like it's a chance to do something.

### You (2025-12-09T15:30:25.383Z)

It is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:30:36.423Z)

Where you're in. I mean, your viability is in a job. I've learned this. I mean, I've been fired on the spot for things that had nothing to do with me. Right. Had things to do with company strategy and downside, like at Radix. Right. And you were just beholden and. You have no control over it whatsoever. And companies are not kind to employees these days. They are. I mean, It's just not. It's strange time to be in the workplace. And it's a time where maybe if you can be a creator, to be a creator and a builder, because employment, I mean, to me. You have to pay your bills, right? I'm. I have to pay my bills, but at the same time, the constraints that you face, like, kind of like my friend, we talk to him. At Airbnb. Right. So he was brought on in a role that seemed really exciting, and then once he gets in and he realizes he has no actual ability to control anything. Right, right. It's like, that's very disheartening very quickly, and. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-09T15:31:42.983Z)

Y. Eah, yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. I'm. I'm really interested to see how the one that I said would be more intense. My first interview was basically with the technical recruiter. It went really, really well. But it was by phone. And yesterday I had a video interview. And what's interesting is it's a company that's a direct competitor of Radix. And they've been around longer. They're very stable, they're profitable. They're growing like crazy. They're just killing Radix. But it became obvious. In both calls that they were observing Radix acquisition Rediq. And what they're looking for, they're looking for. They have a brand new product which is basically geared towards multifailing investors. He mentioned. You know, right now they have some of the basics of, you know, gathering market data and the data that investors would like, but they want to branch out into underwriting and few other things. And I'm like, okay. Dude. There's nobody on the planet. Would be more qualified for this than me, right? And the interview went well. But I'm interested to see because this guy actually worked for conservatives too, right? And we had an awful lot in common. So when I was in multifamily operations and asset management, I was overseeing the resident utility billing program, and that's what Conservus does. And so I was a client up until about a year before he joined. But he joined as a freshman in college and Conservis does that. They're in a university town and all of their employees are college students and whatever they give them full part time jobs. And when he graduated, he was their very first product manager hire. But that was in between when I left as a client and in 2020 joined. But I was working with direct competitors of his, so we were chatting about all the people that worked there and everything else. But long story short, He graduated in 2014 and in 2015, right after graduation, was hired full time by them for this position. And I'm sitting here thinking. That makes him 30 years younger than I am. And despite the fact that we hit it off and everything else, I'm thinking if I ever get a call, say that they moved on with somebody else, There's only one reason. That could happen. Only one. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:34:51.223Z)

Your age, right?

### You (2025-12-09T15:34:53.703Z)

So I'm kind of on pins and needles.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:34:54.263Z)

And. And, you know, you and my uncle. Right? You're my uncle. Are like feeling that, right? And I feel too. But I'll just say this is gender discrimination is very similar, right? It like it.

### You (2025-12-09T15:34:59.783Z)

Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't prove these. That's the problem.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:35:07.303Z)

You can't prove this, but I like you say like I am the only one sometimes that I'm like I'm the only one who does has both acquisitions and asset management experience. Cradle to grave that makes me so valuable because I understand up front what could go wrong. Right? I've been on both sides. I've had to live like I've been the deal person trying to push the deal through, and I understand the pressure of getting deals done, and I've been the person that it gets volleyed to and understand the pressure and the responsibility of the execution, right? No better person for capital markets on this planet than me. And yet I go into male dominated teams. I mean, there is no not male dominated team. Even when I sat in Driftwood for their budget meetings. All men are in the capital markets team, right? And so it's so hard because it's. I feel the same way. It's like there's only one reason why I'm not getting hired, and it's because I'm a woman, right?

### You (2025-12-09T15:35:52.663Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:36:03.623Z)

And my age factors in as well. Once, you know, once they see that I was in business in the 90s, It's clear that I'm older. And so forth, but anyway.

### You (2025-12-09T15:36:15.943Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:36:17.463Z)

Going back to the node situation, one thing that has me puzzled is no one has reached out and said, I need to pay the engineering team Amazon. I mean, is this scenario where I feel like Drew could be potentially, like, pushing the node, like, okay, I'll keep paying the engineering team.

### You (2025-12-09T15:36:34.423Z)

That is. Yeah, that's. I didn't really think about that. But yes, I did ask him after you pinged me. I said, do we need to pay the team for November or December? And two, do you have any out of pocket expenses? And he reply back said no to both, but that was his only reply. No to both.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:36:54.503Z)

Because that is like. Maybe we should bring that up with Sherben. I don't know if Vinod would do that, but it does seem an ode. Seems too risk averse. But I could be really misreading this as well, right? Drew could be offering to keep paying for the software engineering team in India. And maybe that's something that Vinod. I mean, these are his personal relationships with these people, right? For him to like. Cut it. Cold ties like that just seems strange. That he wouldn't want to try to get them compensated or anything like that, so. But there's nothing I can do, right? I've done everything I can do. I mean.

### You (2025-12-09T15:37:33.463Z)

Probably. Yeah. Yeah, I doubt it. I'm just gonna ask him. I'm gonna straight up ask him if he has been in contact with Drew or anything, see what he says.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:37:44.583Z)

You mean it via teams or in a call?

### You (2025-12-09T15:37:47.143Z)

No. Just as an FYI. While you and I have been talking, I realized that Raj is still has access to teams. He was the only one of the developers, and so I disabled his access and I disabled the nodes access based on the email last night. Because now that I'm thinking about it, you know, all of our PRD documentation. All of that stuff is on there. I Disabled Jews access. Mark never had access. I'm disabled Jews access. When you and I first talked to Mike a couple weeks ago, so he has not had access for quite a while. So none of them will have access to the documentation yet, and that's going to be pending whatever decision comes out. If they say I have to or we have to give them access to teams, fine. I'll put their names back in. But yeah, when you mention that and I started thinking maybe he has been in contact with them, I thought, okay, just got. To cut him off. So right now, don't bother trying to get through him on teams. It'll have to be at his phone.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:39:08.503Z)

And when you've said it through these teams chat set, I shouldn't reach out to him. Is he angry at me about this or. I'm just. I mean, I'm. He is. Okay.

### You (2025-12-09T15:39:15.543Z)

Yes. Yes. Yes. You know, I mentioned that a couple weeks ago. I know you and I talked about it. He did say that he is not happy with the way everything turned out. I do think he kind of is aligned with Mark and Drew in terms of, you know, how the money was handled, how Driftwood is handled. Although I'm kind of surprised because I don't think he really has. Any business experience. I mean, he's a very technical person. So, you know, I don't know. If his opinion was swayed by Mark and Drew or what. But, yeah, he has definitely made comments over the last couple weeks that, yeah, he does. He is not happy with the way things were handled. And he is. I know for a fact, you know, like, he's been aligned at least with. Their opinions. I. I don't know that.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:40:16.903Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:40:19.783Z)

He's in business with them, but.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:40:21.943Z)

Okay. So in my thinking, I really do need to think that there is no Vinod going forward. Because the practicality of swaying him back into this. He's at a different point in his life than he was when we first started working on this. There's too much history involved. I mean, is that how I should think of it?

### You (2025-12-09T15:40:38.903Z)

Probably. Well, probably, yes, but that. That's why I said in my message yesterday that it's going to be up to you.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:40:40.103Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:40:49.303Z)

To talk to him and bring him back. And that's why. Because I knew his issue was with how you handled things. And so that's why I thought, let's. Stop doing everything that we can in InnVestAI other than what we've already discussed. Wait for whatever happens with this cease and desist. And if there's a possibility that we can pick up the pieces and move on. That would be the time to call Vinod. When? There's nothing hanging from the cease and desist that would possibly scare him away. Then I think it would be between the two of you to patch things up. And if you could, at that time, maybe he'll come back.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:41:38.583Z)

And what would be your advice and how I need to approach the patching up? Like, as I think about it over the holidays, if I need to just like sit in a quiet place with this myself and be true and genuine in what I'm saying? Right. What would I what specific. I mean, so it was the way I handled Driftwood. It was the way I handled the funds. Was it the way I handled Mark and Drew? Was it that he questions my leadership ability?

### You (2025-12-09T15:42:04.663Z)

I think. I think. I think. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was a little bit of the above. And that's one of the reasons. I think when we had the call with Mark or Mike, and Mike told you bluntly that he didn't think this was managed properly. And what we've talked about as having, like, co CEOs or, you know, maybe we just don't have titles if we. Continue. But the fact that he would be involved with some of the day to day operations if Justica was on board and advising and part of the operations, you know, if he, if he's able to see that. This is definitely going to be a team. Managed operation. And that. Everything. Has to be approved in advance. Not by. Not by 100% right. If two out of three. You know, like the funding. You know, we have to have two signatures on a safe letter. You know, things that you and I have already talked about. Those are the things that would help Vinod be more comfortable. I think, you know, And I kind of got the term from him when we had conversation. Deal. He was afraid of just the unilateral decision making. And if the three of us were partners again, and, you know, I mean, he. He was the one that mentioned that, you know, he would not come back to you at controlling interest. If you could outvote the two of us and just do whatever you wanted, he would not have any part of it. So, you know, when I drafted that letter to you and I mentioned, you know, the possible equity splits, I do think you should have more equity than Benoten. I've because of everything else, but not enough to make unilateral decisions. And those are the things I know he is specifically looking for. He just needs to be comfortable that things that have happened in the past can't happen again in the future.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:44:33.543Z)

Okay? And then can I just say something that I'm thinking about as well, and that is, I love a node and everything he contributed, but this journey that I've been on over the past five years, I mean, there's a lot of risk involved with being a founder. Lots and lots of risk and pain and. Like, defeat and, like. I mean, the emotions. And I shouldn't talk about emotions. I should just talk about, like, the journey and the risk tolerance. And I have been thinking about it, and it's like, I'll go back to this is Vinod likes the idea of being a founder, but, you know, he was sending inspirational videos to me on LinkedIn and then when it got tough, He disappeared. Like, I feel a little bit like that. Does that make sense? Like, when it really got tough, and it will get tough. Like, this isn't the last time it'll be tough. It'll be tough, right? It's gonna be. It's a.

### You (2025-12-09T15:45:28.023Z)

No, no. No, I. No, yeah, I agree. I agree. The only thing I think of. When you mentioned that it got tough is the fact that there were lawyers involved. This time. And I know, and I can't blame him. With all the stuff that's going on with ICE and everything else, that anything that could endanger his visa or anything at all.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:45:51.463Z)

Right. Now.

### You (2025-12-09T15:45:55.463Z)

You know, I think that's going to make him nervous. So there's a difference between when business is difficult and when lawyers get involved. So I don't know. I really think. You know, when he and I had conversations, he was. The three of us were talking about, what do we do? Post breakup. He was on board and, you know, he wanted to continue. But then we get cease and desist letter and that's when it fell apart. So. But. But I agree. And. And this is another thing I've been thinking, too. I've mentioned openly that none of us are irreplaceable. I didn't care whether it was Mark drew myself a note I and I even explicitly said I said that only. That applies to everybody except for you. And. The thing that I didn't anticipate is having to replace three people at once. Right? So that's what got me freaked out, is if the node left.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:46:54.983Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-09T15:46:57.943Z)

But we still had the core team, I think. Yeah, we can. We can probably have enough money and. Yeah, well, no, the four of us being Mark, Drew, you and I. I mean, the original five. And, you know, this was a couple months ago when we were discussing this, or even over the summer.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:47:03.783Z)

The core team being the folks in India.

### You (2025-12-09T15:47:19.943Z)

You know, because there was a call, and I. I don't know who said what, but, you know, I. I think Drew made a comment, and I said. I said, no, I. You know, I disagree. If one of the five of us got hit by a bus. It wouldn't be the end of invest. It would set us back, but it wouldn't be the end. Every single one of us is replaceable. And I kept thinking that over and over. But last couple days, and especially after last night's email, I'm thinking, all right. This could be the nail in the coffin.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:47:54.503Z)

Well, let's break that down a moment, because I just. I. I just have to. I mean. I had to part ways with Mark. Like, Mark and I were not going to work together, right? And I didn't respect him. I couldn't go to him to ask him his opinion like I do to you. Right? Like, it was so fractured. And that's what he wanted. He wanted the validation that I would. Come to him. Right? But the negativity.

### You (2025-12-09T15:48:00.823Z)

I know. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:48:20.503Z)

And there's a real reason. I worked with someone like Mark one time in my life. His name is Nir Lee Blaine. And it almost killed me, the negativity that I had to face every day. Right. So same personality, very strong willed, opinionated deal guy, ego. And he brought a lot to the table, but. He killed the. The culture of the team, right? And so Mark was a culture killer. And. And he was not someone. And so that had to happen. The fact that Drew got involved with that, it breaks my heart. But as I think about it, sometimes in times of uncertainty, people gravitate Howard the loudest voice, right? And you do have the gender dynamics between the three of us, where they think of themselves as expert domain experts, right? And there's. There's some gender nuances that happened where I think Drew just felt like Mark could sell the product. Right. And Drew's had a hard time launching his product and selling his product.

### You (2025-12-09T15:49:21.863Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:49:26.583Z)

For reasons. Because it's just a dashboarding product. Right. You've talked about this. It's like it really is just a dashboarding product. What? I would have wanted that to happen with Drew. No, but in the end, Drew was only wanting to spend 10% or 15% of his time. Right. That was. Really problematic. And there was also not the transparency that I had hoped with hotel biz. Like, I had really hoped we could just maybe buy hotel biz and roll it into our platform. But that wasn't going to happen because I think he was doing things that his partners actually didn't know about. Right by spending so much time on InnVestAI. I'm not sure his partners knew the full extent that he was spending on InnVestAI. He was also very untransparent about Profit Sword, and I feel like he should have been, like, showing the team more like, this is what Profit Sort has done. Right, let me show you what already exists.

### You (2025-12-09T15:49:29.703Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:50:25.543Z)

So could that have worked going forward? I. It breaks my heart that he sided with Mark because I just think Mark is such. I mean, a difficult personality. But he did, and that is shake out of it. Do I need Mark?

### You (2025-12-09T15:50:40.823Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:50:43.703Z)

I don't know. I mean, I need to think about how I sell into capital markets, right? I need to do some thinking about that. But. I'm the one, like, you know, like, I'm the one who believes in going out and raising the money around this. I'm the one that has deep ties into the women's founder, the women's network, right?

### You (2025-12-09T15:50:59.463Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:51:05.383Z)

Vinod. Now that's crushing to me. It's just crushing to me again, because I thought we had a good rapport. And to hear his dissatisfaction with me on these things. When. But. But that's good feedback for me to have. And then you've kind of heard my feedback as well, that maybe the Node just isn't suited to be a founder. Right? A true founder, where he's got to take a lot of risk.

### You (2025-12-09T15:51:24.343Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, And I don't do it. I don't disagree with that. Yeah, that's. That's why. That's again, over these next few weeks.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:51:32.823Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-09T15:51:37.863Z)

If there is a way to continue moving forward and bring Vinod on. I would. I would put him in the key employee category. You know, he gets a salary, he's a paid employee, and he gets equity. But not a founder's equity, not voting equity. He would just have skin in the game, right?

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:51:57.303Z)

Right. And there is. To me, that's all the difference in the world. Because I feel like you and I are enough like minded that we could resolve any conflict that existed between us.

### You (2025-12-09T15:52:07.703Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:52:09.063Z)

Right. But it's when you start to feel like I could be outvoted. And what happened?

### You (2025-12-09T15:52:09.463Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:52:15.463Z)

Crushed me like to have two partners try, right? So I like. But I would sign a simple operating agreement. A three page operating agreement with you tomorrow. I have that much faith, right? But the idea that two partners could go against me again is when I was really trying to save us. I really was like, did I mishandle things? Yes, I did. And I. The governance piece, I was sloppy with it. But this is also my first time through this, right? So I. I did what I felt needed to. Be done for survival. There is $7,500 sitting in an account right now to use, right? Like, I didn't want to take Mark's money, right? Because you start to take Mark's money, he becomes a bigger and bigger and bigger.

### You (2025-12-09T15:52:31.863Z)

Right. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:53:06.263Z)

Ego in. In player in it. And so, like, there could be, you know, $12,000 in that account, which was more than Drew contributed and more than Mark was willing to contribute. Not that it's my money. It's not my money, but I was trying to create, like, cash flow for us, right? Like some sort of like money to start to pay bills with. It was all so good intentioned when it. When it all came down to it.

### You (2025-12-09T15:53:35.143Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:53:37.863Z)

Anyway, sorry, but for you to think about and.

### You (2025-12-09T15:53:38.103Z)

All right. No, I I. Yeah. I just really think you and I are still on the same page. I'm not. I'm not concerned about that. It's just. How can we. Start over. Again if we have to. Or what partnerships can we do?

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:53:55.463Z)

Are you okay if I send you some stuff on atelier over the break? I mean, just so that you can kind of like.

### You (2025-12-09T15:53:59.063Z)

Yeah, yeah. No, I'm not building a wall here. I'm not shutting down. I'm just saying I don't want to.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:54:02.983Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-09T15:54:06.983Z)

Spend any time building anything or coding anything, doing anything like that, having, you know, random meetings, except for Mike and Jessica. And mark those three, I would get on the call at any time. That, that's fine. And same thing, you and I. If you want to have a one on one or if there's anything that's going on, you know, I'm not just shutting down, but. I guess I don't want to do anything to make any type of a commitment, either with the product or with anybody else. Until we have something in writing that says we're done, this is it. We've made our agreement. Mark and Drew go their way. We go our way. It's clean. We never have to deal with them. That's what I'm ready to start. Moving forward. So.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:55:01.223Z)

Okay. I understand. That's a clear boundary, well communicated, so thank you. Right. I feel like that's why we work well together, because you are clear and rational and I respect. What you say. So I'll. We'll keep teamsing with Sherben, and then I'll send you some stuff on atelier. I mean, not this week, but probably when I have some downtime. Next week. Yep.

### You (2025-12-09T15:55:16.103Z)

Yeah. Appreciate that. Yeah, whatever.

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:55:27.783Z)

And just see where it goes.

### You (2025-12-09T15:55:28.183Z)

Okay? Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-09T15:55:31.303Z)

All right. Thanks, Howard. Bye.

### You (2025-12-09T15:55:31.783Z)

Very good. All right, we'll see you.
