# Transcript for: Weekly sync product & tech

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:01:35.278Z)

Howard. I have to take my son to Ent. But I'll be here.

### You (2025-11-07T15:01:43.761Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:01:46.398Z)

So arrange and Sim they're going to demo you progress. So Raj will demo UI changes and probably something on year zero. And then sim will show few things on the background processing probably on map on other things.

### You (2025-11-07T15:02:04.401Z)

Excellent.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:02:05.918Z)

And yeah. After that if probably we could, if we could some. I mean add. Did you get a chance to go through what exactly is remaining for this demo thing that we are trying to close by December1?

### You (2025-11-07T15:02:28.001Z)

Basically what I mentioned on the call yesterday. As long as we can create a deal. Upload a financial statement. Show blue participants in the data. In the model. And. Then we will not go. Through every single item. Item. But you want to. Kind of show the revenue. And maybe adjust the line to show the calculations are live. Same thing on the Excel plan. Maybe one or two rows on the expense line. Is where we then go. And then hopefully. 15 minutes.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:03:14.558Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-07T15:03:14.961Z)

Would be all it takes. But we would also want to show. The. Market. Ing page or the market data.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:03:27.678Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:03:33.521Z)

But that's just too much data to go through and actually done this. We could use a PowerPoint for two pages. And.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:03:44.878Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-07T15:03:45.441Z)

Then that. Should be about it. Just the core functionality.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:03:50.078Z)

Right. Drew also added bunch of points in the other feedback. So I don't know whether we should focus on those or Mark, I don't know whether we could really do everything. Probably we could either take that feedback or the market data, because market data, that feedback and whatever remaining items we have.

### You (2025-11-07T15:04:14.401Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:04:14.798Z)

Not really sure whether we'll be able to do all of that, but probably we could prioritize what is more important.

### You (2025-11-07T15:04:20.721Z)

Yeah. Maybe we should go through the email. And just. Pick and choose. The other thing as well is all of that information that Larc. Said about the lenders, right?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:04:36.558Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-07T15:04:37.681Z)

So knowing that. The lenders are going to. Be our first. Clients. There are some things we need to add. And other things that maybe. We can hide. But it seems that we need to add. Our. Pretty minor. So I don't know if you had a chance to take a look at. That.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:05:01.678Z)

I did. Look at that. Are you going to add those requirement into PRD or.

### You (2025-11-07T15:05:01.681Z)

New. That's also what we need to talk about. I think we could probably do that. And even if it sets it back, A few days. We can talk about it. But really for the lender. We. Would need a few more. Of those inputs. On that. Normal. Like another page of lender page, right. That has some of the data that they would need to input. And then all their inside field calculations, which are actually very simple calculation. S. We. Can talk about that. Now. I didn't think we need that for the demo. I think if we had the model.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:05:51.518Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:05:55.761Z)

Basically what you've already got. But kind of. In just adding. More pages to it. I don't think that would be difficult to get there. So that as we're going through and setting up a property for the first time, we can show them the lender page that has these checkboxes. And as part of the demo. We're not going to go through and actually create a deal. We're going to show them the pages, show the input. We want to have a deal that's ready to go. We can pull up. We'll use the same financial statement for every demo, one that we know that works. So that we don't have any surprises on the demo for a couple of financial statements that doesn't work. So that's probably what we want to focus on. We can continue working on. Getting the rest of the stuff up for version one.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:06:51.198Z)

I'm going to be off camera as I'm starting to drive, but I'm here on audio.

### You (2025-11-07T15:06:55.521Z)

Ok?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:06:58.798Z)

Hi can demo as well. So in whatever sequence you want to go. Thank you. I'd like to start first with the UIU exchanges. Let me share my screen. It's visible right now. In case. So first of the few things. Like I changed these cards. And I think they. They were taking too much space here. So for now, I have, like, consolidated them and. They do display all all the type of deals like you asked us. And the completion rate also is displayed like how many deals have been closed. Based on that, we'll have the percentage here. Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:08:09.761Z)

Let me. Walk. Real quick. I did send an email to everybody. About? The map. Those three cards that you have on the top will actually. Have to be compressed. Quite a bit more. So that those three cards take up. Maybe. At most 50. Percent of. The width. Of the screen. At the top and. Then the other 50% will have. A map. But also the map. Will have to be. Deeper. Than just. One row. And so. We could have. Up to. Six cards. That way. We could have those three there. And then three more below it. But. We can discuss that later. But. That's another thing we want to talk about is clearly have a map. Em. Bedded into. The pages. By December 1st. If not, then we don't want to change what you have here.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:09:12.238Z)

We can have a map, Howard, we are already working on that. So yeah, map will be there. The only thing was I would consider about the UX changes, right? I mean the map. My positioning particularly, because if we just have those three cards in one line and then map on right. The height of the map is too low. So we'll probably space out few things.

### You (2025-11-07T15:09:42.081Z)

Right. Let that go. That's what I was mentioning a minute ago. Also. We could just have the three cards stack. Ed. Maybe not quite so high. Right? We can make them a little bit narrower. And that one. The cards could take up one third of the screen, and then the map could take up 2/3. That'll be more. It is small width and if you go swee cards high, that should be sufficient for the map. But I am concerned.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:10:13.438Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-07T15:10:14.241Z)

I don't want too high because then.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:10:14.558Z)

That will. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-07T15:10:17.441Z)

We're going to have a negative impact. On the table. Below.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:10:21.438Z)

Right. Right. So that will basically take the. What you call the main. Main part of the screen. So we do want to kind of show both of those items, the table, the map, and the cards, but in a way that they fit the screen. And we can have those heights dynamic based on the screen size. So on pro Laptop laptop screen, the height of those cards and the map would be little less. But if you go bigger screen, then the height can increase.

### You (2025-11-07T15:10:46.561Z)

Y. Eah. We can also have. The map pop out. Right. So a lot of these companies could have. Hotels all across the country. So you might have the entire. Map of the United States on their right. So. They might have just a bunch of really tiny dots. So we may just want to have. A pop out as well, so we can keep the map small. But if they want to see a larger map, they just click on it. And they can. View it and then close. It out. Come back to the pipeline page. That way we don't have to. Compromise. Too much of the table size. We. Have options. We can explore. You guys decide what works best. Sorry.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:11:52.158Z)

And I have few more changes like on the deal detail detail page. So currently I have few of them on my local so I'll be showing them from here. Only. That's. Okay? So unlike you asked. So coming first two and the these buttons. Like I have highlighted them. Side this container. Okay. And added a few more details from a form data. Like if it's a market competitor or not, and a few more like brand and management. It also gives us some space for description, if that's required. Like is. Is it necessary?

### You (2025-11-07T15:12:46.481Z)

Real quick. Just real quick to change. Can you switch places with the brand in the sense society? The census id. Has to do with the property address and everything. But management and brand are very closely related, so it just makes sense if they're on the same row.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:13:11.518Z)

Okay? So I can do like. We can switch places with brand and sensor id, that's what. Okay.

### You (2025-11-07T15:13:12.401Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Simple, simple change.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:13:20.158Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-11-07T15:13:20.481Z)

R.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:13:21.278Z)

Okay? Okay? So next thing is the description needed here, like. The property details. Like. Is it necessary to put this here in the property details? Or I just have added something extra. I just wanted to confirm this.

### You (2025-11-07T15:13:41.441Z)

No. That's really good.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:13:44.478Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:13:44.961Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:13:45.838Z)

Okay. And then, like, I have added documents card. Like. Like you asked to shift it. Out. Done that. And then the AI summary part has been like, I made it in inside a container. And then for just the highlighting part,

### You (2025-11-07T15:14:03.121Z)

Y. Eah. That.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:14:06.638Z)

Like I gave it a color. Like, it's more highlighted right now, okay? Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:14:11.601Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:14:13.278Z)

Then comes the revenue and expense. Card. So we do. We already had that. So then, coming to a side navigation. Like you already have a pro forma. Currently like it does look like this. It's quite like. It's not quite visible, I guess. Like everything has shrinked, right?

### You (2025-11-07T15:14:43.441Z)

We also need to change on the proof of concepts so we actually only have. Two. Sub links under the performer. You've got. Penetration analysis and revenue. Has one link and then expense as of the second.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:15:05.598Z)

So we are keeping.

### You (2025-11-07T15:15:05.681Z)

And that was.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:15:07.838Z)

So this won't be a collapsible thing, right? I don't need to add categories. And yet.

### You (2025-11-07T15:15:13.281Z)

Right? Right. Well, let's talk about that, because I'm the actual pro forma page again. What I did in the POC is separate two different pages. Hypothetical section and the web researching most of those who are relatively small still. Ready? We combine that one page. But when you scroll down. Total revenue is the last flow on the page. And when we sell Stage, because I have way more categories, I actually need a separate page.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:15:48.238Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:15:49.601Z)

Whereas in this version, you can go all the way from the top to the bottom. Scrolling in a single page. We can do that. Or we can read it the way it is and just get your feedback. And see which they prefer.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:16:13.758Z)

But I still think. Like, we can add a bit more width to it. Like, the contents might be more visible. Right. So I am. So we can definitely increase the sidebar a little bit if if you see the gap between the sidebar. And the right side content. Yes, yes, probably. But the thing is, like, pro forma takes up much space, right? Performance still has much, so we can decrease it on Forma but increase it on deal detail, so that should be fine. Okay? Sure.

### You (2025-11-07T15:16:58.161Z)

You can also hide the sidebar.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:17:02.318Z)

That is. We already have it.

### You (2025-11-07T15:17:04.961Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:17:07.918Z)

And you also should be able to navigate between.

### You (2025-11-07T15:17:10.721Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:17:11.118Z)

Investment summary and valuation. Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:17:16.081Z)

So also refer to the PLC regarding the order of. The links, the. Valuation goes above pro form. A. Because they need to fill in that information before they start working on the pro forma.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:17:39.278Z)

Before pushing it to Debo stage. Like, I'll change that.

### You (2025-11-07T15:17:44.001Z)

Yeah. It's just simply reordering them. So. Okay, so here you can see right now.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:17:46.478Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:17:48.401Z)

Right, so you've got the valuation top. And now instead of having a link called Profuma, you just say should the penetration and revenue. If you click on that, And if you scroll there, you can see it just goes down to total revenue. And that's the end of the page. Then you click on the expense analysis in the sidebar. And it does the same thing for the expense analysis. Whether. I have no objection to leaving it the way it is. And then just getting user feedback. What we'll do is, as we're reviewing with the users, we'll let them actually use the model that you put together. And then we can bring up the. Plc and say which. Looks. Better to you. Which would you prefer?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:18:39.838Z)

And that actually quite sums up my part. But like, I also have one more question regarding the and these four things. Like, we do have them on Dashboard and you kind of mentioned something like we we might not actually need these on the deal detail page or either pro forma page.

### You (2025-11-07T15:19:07.361Z)

A couple of things. I think the documents in here, Linux went up a 404. When you click on them, I think there isn't a page.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:19:18.478Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-07T15:19:20.081Z)

So can you. Yeah. Let's leave those in the sidebar, but let's disable the link.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:19:20.638Z)

There are.

### You (2025-11-07T15:19:24.801Z)

S. So that users don't click on them and think something. 's broken. We'll just put a little.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:19:31.838Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:19:32.641Z)

Banner. Coming soon. Or something like that.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:19:37.038Z)

We can add a coming soon page, I guess.

### You (2025-11-07T15:19:39.441Z)

Yes. Because one of the things we have to. Remember is. Documents. Actually ideal specific. So you've got that documents section right there. In your dashboard. So. That may just need to be removed.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:20:01.998Z)

Okay. This new documents, right?

### You (2025-11-07T15:20:04.481Z)

Yeah. So go back to the poc. If you go to the other tab. Yeah. So. See, we've got documents and reports. Below. The investment summary.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:20:16.878Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:20:18.001Z)

So those are things that a user. Would. Not have any use for until they've gone through the process of creating performance and everything. So again, if you think about the workflow, They start by creating a deal. In the pipeline, then they input the property details. Then they upload the market data. Then they put in their valuation assumptions. And they. Have to get that information before they even start working on the pro forma, right? Then you create the performer. Then once you've got the data, You need that data? To create a report. Right. And documents.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:20:57.998Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-07T15:20:59.281Z)

You would upload over again. So one thing to remember is that it sometimes takes months. To. Go through the acquisition process. So the day that I create this deal, I'm going to have. Let's just say I created a deal today. The most recent financial statement that I'll have available to you will be September. Because October just finished. And they're still working on the. Accounting. So. In two weeks. You read the financials? Have done around the 15th through the 24 months. So let's just say on November 15, The salary sends me the October financial statements, so I'm going to have to go back to the documents page. Drag and drop. The October statement. And bring it in. And same thing I might not be buying and actually closing on the deal till January or February. And so each month I'm going to be uploading more documents. So that's what I think. It would be best. To have that. Document link. Lower. If you go back to. Your model. Now, if we move the documents down below within the Deal Actions page, Right? So if we follow that same. Layout. That we have on the poc. Believe analytics and reports. Because we're going to have. Account level reports. And ann. Ux. They also have deer level account. S and analytics. We haven't gotten to that point yet. So we'll actually have, like, an analytics and the reports link. In the deal. Actions sessions as well as the upper section. There. But for now. But for now. Let's move that documents down below valuation. But also disable it. Right. I don't want somebody clicking on it and getting an error. And same thing with the analytics.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:23:15.038Z)

So you want me to, like, shift the documents below? And analytics should be disabled along with documents. Right.

### You (2025-11-07T15:23:23.201Z)

Yes. Perfect.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:23:26.478Z)

So we'll have dashboard analytics and reports in the upper section. Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:23:31.921Z)

Yeah. Exactly.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:23:33.198Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-11-07T15:23:35.041Z)

Yeah, sorry for the long rule of explanations. I just want you to understand the reasoning behind.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:23:39.518Z)

No. So I guess that and that's all from my side. Sure you can continue. The order. Yeah. So I worked on this. Background processing and non operating field. So here I did edit the details, and I did the document. So now when we create the deal, The model closes and we show the message that Deal Test 2 has been created. Uploaded document are still processing. We will notify you once document processing is completed and for a time being user can go to any page like view detail page. And like, anywhere, like Performa. So we would have to probably wait for the deal to get created. Until then. We have this non operating field. This one. This total non operating expenses. Which contain this management fees. We have management fees and incentive management fees, as you said, like these. Both of them are kind of related, and they would sum up, sum up for total management fees. And then we have real estate taxes, insurance, rent and lease and other non operating expense. So right now, as we said, like. Like Drew mentioned, This other expenses and owner expenses, we are summing this up. Which is. 3500697.

### You (2025-11-07T15:25:28.961Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:25:29.198Z)

And showing it in other non operating expense. We are good, right? And that's it for total non operating expense. We added it here and yeah, here we get the message. Like the TL test 2 has been processed successfully. And from here we can go to the deals page. Following week. Hel. Lo. Am I audible? Yes, yes.

### You (2025-11-07T15:26:23.681Z)

So I can hear.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:26:27.198Z)

Yeah. So right now, as I just showed, when we give the notification, and by clicking on the view reel, we can go to the theme page.

### You (2025-11-07T15:26:42.561Z)

Very. Nice. So it looks like the mapping.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:26:47.278Z)

Where you able to see the notification? I think I went too quickly. Is my voice clear? Yes, it's from my side. That's what I wanted to show. The background processing and non operating earning.

### You (2025-11-07T15:27:23.361Z)

Looks. Good.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:27:29.038Z)

I guess. I guess we are done with the demo part. If you have anything to share.

### You (2025-11-07T15:27:38.641Z)

Yeah. So I did, as you know, send out the emails earlier this week about the maps. And there was one on the thing. But one thing I do want to let. Everybody know I will be working to document. This, but we need to. Keep in mind. For every. Feature. And even the ui, we need to keep in mind that we need to have. Flexibility. In the model. First off. By Persona. Herb the mode and I talk about that our first test clients are going to be. Lenders. And that's because the numbers don't need to get into the details. Right, so food and beverage and other operated income. There two more levels of. Line items within those categories. Investors and brokers really need to get down to that level of granular. Ity, but lenders don't. So that's one of the reasons why we're starting off with. Lenders. But what we need to do is we're going to have to have. Just. One. Model. That encompasses. All of our Personas. But what the user sees. Will be. Controlled by future flags. Right? So we need to make sure that we are planning for future flags. Of both the Persona. Right. And that would be at the account level. So when. I. Am a part of what's called it, Howard Bank. And Howard bank is a lender. When I log in. My account. Will be associated with a lender Persona, so everything I've seen in the eye will be specific to me. In addition. When they have the core model, which is what you're creating. Right now. That's going to be something that everybody will be subscribed to. But still, even within that core model, What they see is going to be determined by their Persona. So some of those metrics that we're working. On. Like those cards. At the top of the page. Don't apply to lenders. But they've got specific metrics. That they need. Right. So women enough to make a decision. That, for example. The ro. I and the cash on cash. Cards. They're not applicable to a bank. To a lender. But. Then they have other ones saying you have that feature flag and built behind the sales. But when Howard logs in and how does a lender. He sees these cards. And. That one's left for investors and bankers, right? We need to. Be conscious of that. And like I said, I'm going to put together a document that will show the Personas. And then as we build, we're going to have to decide, ok, is this. For all Personas. Ones for this Persona. Right. It could be one Persona, it could be 3%, it could be all six. Depending. On which way it goes. So I just want to bring that up. Because right now we're at a point where we're just focusing on the lenders. But the model that we have put together, the proof of concept, It's a little. Bit of everything. But it doesn't fit any. One particular Persona. So some of those kinds that we're working on now, we don't want to have visible. In december. When we start going to the lenders, we still have to substitute some of those cards. But the last thing we want to do is have. A model for lenders. A model. For investors. And because there's so many things that are applicable to all. We don't want to have to go in and maintain six separate models. Right. So we want to do everything that we can. Right from the very start. To. Be able to use. Our. Core model. But have the features. Specific to. The user. Right. It's going to take a little bit of work with the feature flags and making sure, because we're going to be adding on new features, AI related features, or different types of reports. Different types of things that they can add on over and above the core models, part of our monetization strategy. So things like that, too, we'll have to. Connect to our CRM system so that when we sign up an account, then say, okay, I walked the base model and I want feature one. Or. Feature one and three. Right. We know exactly what. To turn on. For that particular account. Any questions on that?

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:33:13.678Z)

I guess not. Just one question. Are you saying it will be a type of subscription based service? Ok?

### You (2025-11-07T15:33:24.001Z)

Yes. It will be a subscription. Based service. Another thing. I'm working on the pricing. But one of the things is that. With AI features. You don't know. What? Your cost is going to. Be. Right? Because. It's all about token z and tokens out. If we had a very simple and basic AI like, ideal summary that we're going. To market with. Right? We know that that's going to be. Minimal. But as we expand our AI based offerings. We're talking about. The next version of this being our. AI augmented model where they can just input the deal details, push a button. And we're going to have an agent. Go out and get tax information, insurance information, market data. And then they have a lot. Of. Data coming in. So we're going to have to charge. Every time that they query. We're going to have to monitor those queries. And dropping 100 tokens will use and coming back with our cost per token. So it's going to get complicated. Although there's a lot of tools out there, we don't have to build ourself. We'll use some of those third party tools. That will measure the usage and everything like that. But again, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:34:59.198Z)

Ay.

### You (2025-11-07T15:35:00.241Z)

We're going to have to build in the logic. That says ok, if they subscribe to AI tool number one. They get this fixed amount. If they subscribe to AI tool number two. Then we're going to have to charge because the ideas we're going to have in the chat box, right? So they can start asking questions. So today. They have to go to each individual line item and make adjustments. So in order to get the rate of return that they want on the investment, if it does. If that ROI doesn't quite get to what they need. They're going to make adjustments. How much? Maybe can I raise my prices, can I lower my expenses, et cetera? The idea is that they can have a conversation with the model. And say, what can I change? Or how much do recommendation. What can you change my assumptions to get by? Ir whatever I need. And let the model go through and make the adjustments right? That's going to. Be a lot of. Tokens going back and forth. And if they keep going and keep going, right, that's going to build up. So that's the type of scenario that we need to be able to. Monitor. And make sure that we can build the clients. For their usage. Again. I want to put together a document. It's going to be fairly generic. But it's not going to get into specific features. It's just going to be saying, here are the various levels that we need to have. Feature flags. How we want to handle going forward to make sure that. If I. Don't put something in the pid. If I accidentally overlook and say if I omit the feature flag, you guys will know at least a bit. I think this is a feature flag, Right? Bring it back. So just a long way. Sure it doesn't slip through the cracks.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:37:07.518Z)

It says. Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:37:11.441Z)

But that's all I did. Anything else? It's looking really good. But I will get with him. And make sure you know by the beginning of. Next week. Exactly. What we need. For. A live demo versus what we can just put in a PowerPoint slide and just show the people what's going on there. So I definitely don't want to have to go out. There with a full operating. Model. We. Can't. We got to get up there. So. We need to start raising funds. And getting some money there, and we can't do that. Without having something to show.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:37:54.798Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-07T15:37:55.601Z)

So hopefully you guys will have clarification on. What needs to be there. And then we'll also come prioritizing because there are things I'm sure. That you can add to the dem. O model. Middle of december. Or beginning of January. Whenever. We'll just add them as we can. All right. Ok? Happy. Friday. Weekend.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:38:23.998Z)

Okay. Yeah. Just one question. One question. I forgot.

### You (2025-11-07T15:38:27.281Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:38:31.598Z)

Regarding the year Zero part. So, like, do we have any documents that will only have the partial year data? Like currently I had a document like it had whole year data, like what you showed in the mail. Right.

### You (2025-11-07T15:38:52.241Z)

We do.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:38:52.398Z)

So it had actual and forecast. We don't have to do anything with the forecast columns, right?

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:00.721Z)

No. No. If it just has powerful year actual.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:01.838Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:05.921Z)

That's all you need. We just need the year to. Date.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:09.678Z)

Okay, understood. Yes.

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:11.201Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:12.158Z)

That's it.

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:13.281Z)

That's related to my explanation. There. The projection columns or the forecast columns are coming from the seller. But.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:22.078Z)

Yes, Emmanuel reports.

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:22.321Z)

We as buyer? Yeah, I don't care what the seller is sarcastic. I need to put in what I think it's going to do.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:27.918Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:29.601Z)

After I buy. The property. So.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:32.238Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:33.121Z)

It's just noise.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:39:36.558Z)

Okay, understood.

### You (2025-11-07T15:39:39.841Z)

Do you? Have access to the folder on the panels site that has all of. The financial statements and samples, or have they been. Downloaded. Because we have a lot of simple financial statements. I want to make sure that. We're using as many of those different formats as possible for testing.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:40:02.718Z)

I used to have access to my team. I guess we have already downloaded all that folder.

### You (2025-11-07T15:40:10.801Z)

Okay? Yeah. As long as they've been downloaded, you've got access to them. That's all we need. Some. Okay? Excellent.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:40:18.958Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-11-07T15:40:19.121Z)

We'll see you guys next week.

### Guest (2025-11-07T15:40:20.398Z)

Have a nice day. Okay? Yep.
