# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:01:48.430Z)

Hey, friend.

### You (2025-10-29T14:01:49.711Z)

Hey, good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:01:51.790Z)

I'm all right. How are you?

### You (2025-10-29T14:01:53.711Z)

I'm doing pretty well. Trying to close a couple things up here on my screens. Got too many things going on. So how's your week been? Other than not feeling well.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:02:09.470Z)

Yeah. Yeah, the grocery store, like, when people get sick, you know, it's like, boom. You just goes crazy. So I'm a little under the weather. Like, a lot of the people that are that work there.

### You (2025-10-29T14:02:12.991Z)

Yeah. Sorry to hear that.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:02:23.310Z)

That's all right. Before we get going with, like, Regular work. I have a favorite ask of you and it is, you know, over summer when we kind of talk to a few of my friends and we did a little demo, right? And it was just to get some industry intel and things like that. I was wondering if you'd be open over the next two weeks to doing two more of those.

### You (2025-10-29T14:02:45.151Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:02:45.390Z)

And there's a specific reason. So, again, they're just industry friends. But they're on my radar screen for two reasons. One is a young man named Will Webster. I worked with him at C. Beren. He was in the research group. The hotel research group. And he's again, he's in his early or mid-30s. Why I like him. He'd be someone that I would put on our talent acquisition radar over the next two years, call it right. So it's a long. It's a long term thing, but he was the person that would spend his nights voluntarily trying to figure out, like, API integrations with different companies and. Things like that. He always showed, like, way more. What's the word I'm looking like, commitment and just like work ethic. And then what was requested of him. But he's not like you, right? He doesn't. He's not as. He doesn't have your skill set, per se, but I. Think he could be, like, a good addition to us over the next couple of years. He's based here in Atlanta. And then secondly, why, this is bad of me, but I really like him in and of himself. Like, I would without a doubt recommend we think about him as our team grows. But secondarily, his dad in my opinion, is the most influential hotel broker in the country. His name is Bob Webster. And I don't know if you remember Jessica, the tech woman that we spoke with back in the fall, but she brought up Bob Webster as well as, like, a potential investor, and she knows him really well and things like that, so. There is a little bit of, like, you know, something in the back of my mind thinking, okay, well, his dad's probably gonna retire in a few years, and he's gonna be looking out for his son's best interest. He's really well connected. But again, Will, in and of himself, has. I've just always been incredibly impressed with just his curiosity. Right. And his work ethic.

### You (2025-10-29T14:03:55.791Z)

Okay? Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:04:56.030Z)

So he's one. Young, mid-30s. Right. Just to show him what we've done, you know that CBRE shut down their hotel research program. So I think he's job hunting now. Again, we don't have the money to hire him, but just one of those things. The second person is a gentleman. I know he's a. Friend of mine, his name is.

### You (2025-10-29T14:05:05.951Z)

Yeah. Okay? Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:05:21.470Z)

Why can't. I'm so tired and I'm not feeling well. Oh, my God. I can't even think of his name right now. I don't know if you've ever had a moment like that where your mind just his name all the time.

### You (2025-10-29T14:05:31.471Z)

Oh, all the time. Yeah. To me, that's business as usual.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:05:37.470Z)

No, let me. I just. Because it's so important, I want to make sure I get. Jim Alderman is his name. So Jim Alderman, for many, many years was in brand develop, business development, brand business development with Starwood. He went on to take a very difficult role as the COO of Radisson. And right as he took, or maybe it was CEO, but right as he took that role, Radisson literally went under, like, investigation and his entire world blew up, right? His first day or his first week. He has people from the Treasury Department coming in and, like, locking things up and locking files down. I'll always remember that story that he told me.

### You (2025-10-29T14:06:23.791Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:06:24.510Z)

And now he has had a residential for Airbnb. So Jim is probably my age, maybe your age, like somewhere in between our ages, I would say. And he was on his own for a couple of years before he took this job as head of residential at Airbnb. He is an amazing personality. He is. And I probably cringe when I say this word, but he is like an adjacent hey, bro. And what I mean by that is he sits at the periphery like one could consider him. I don't know, you can see my hand. Like a hey bro. Right? He sits here. He knows all the hey bros from all of his years, but he's actually a really great person. He does not bring with him some of the hey, bro. BS that comes with that personality. And he once had an idea that he believed in. He wanted to grow the outdoor hospitality business, and it ended up that someone did it. Right. He was the original person with that business idea, but someone else did it. And I know he regrets to this day that he didn't push that forward, but anyway. Airbnb, obviously, is a technology company. He knows a lot of people, which is why I want to show him this. But I also just have in the back of my mind, like, if something were to happen to us and we needed to find another type of person, another person that could almost fill that role, he might be a really good person to kind of put on our slate for this is making sense, like a friend, someone who's very good at business development, someone who really understands the capital markets well, who is well connected, but also who is kind and empathetic and brings some of that to the table.

### You (2025-10-29T14:08:07.711Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:08:23.950Z)

So it's not like their customers. It's not like. Right. It's not like they're investors. Neither of them. They're just people that. I want them to meet you because I like you so much. And I'd like you to meet them because you just never know where life leads you. Right.

### You (2025-10-29T14:08:43.231Z)

Yeah, no, that is. That is very true. No, I'm wide open, so.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:08:47.630Z)

Okay, good, good. And we would do kind of what we did over summer, talk about the platform, how we came together. You know, just show a little bit. It's not like it's a demo, right? It's just show a little bit of what we've got and talk about where we're going.

### You (2025-10-29T14:08:58.991Z)

Right. Yeah. And we. We may have something that's demoable or at least the. The core features by then, so. Been working a lot with Vinod and the team. We had that Year zero issue that we had to tackle that we really didn't address in the PoC. And so we've got. Clear direction on that. I just need to document it today.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:09:27.310Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:09:27.951Z)

Might. Might take me a couple days. And we've talked about the ui, so. There's a list of things that need to be done. But. They're not. That large. It's just, you know, little things that need to be checked off. To get to a product that we can actually demo. So. One of the things that, that we brought up in the call yesterday is staging is ready the staging environment. So that would be what we use to demo. And what I need to do is get with you and Drew and Mark as well and find out. The bare minimum. Of what we would be comfortable demoing. I have my ideas. I think Mark's going to be on the other end of the spectrum, and I think you and Jool be somewhere in between. Of. Of what we really need to have an actual working demo model right now. And then we'll go ahead and get that all set. But another thing is, the speed of the demo matters. And right now it's set up just like we would if we were to go public. Or bring in some. Some outside clients. And you've got all these required fields that you have to populate when you're setting up a deal. Don't want to do that in a demo. You want? Just the basic information. So we do need to make certain fields not required. So, you know, name. City, state don't need the. We don't need the street address, you know, in order to get the information we need. All we need is basically the zip code. But we need more and not worry about the type of property it is. You know, who's the broker. I mean, all those other fields. Otherwise, you know, you get this uncomfortable period where somebody's typing in and the other person sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Yeah, so.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:11:45.710Z)

I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Which is Jurassic Express. Concerned about that before, too, right. He said when he was demoing his product early on, it would take 30 seconds for something to work.

### You (2025-10-29T14:11:53.151Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll get that. And what I really want to do is, like. Like I said, if we can settle on, you know, in. In my opinion, we need to show. Show. The functionality. So create a deal. Upload a statement. Show the data. In the model. Without bouncing back and forth and say, oh, see, here's this number. Here it is, here, here. You know, maybe. Maybe one or two, but can't get bogged down in showing all these things. And then the input fields for some of the other areas. So, you know, we can show the market data, but we don't need that. That doesn't do anything right now. That's just user input for their reference. But we do need to go through, like, the. The valuation and show the fields there. I mean, we could populate something. And then just quickly show. Okay, here's the pro forma. You know, you can go through and change these rows, change one or two, don't go through everything, and then pop over to the investment summary. And show. Here's all of our years. Here's our metrics. Nobody is going to sit there with a calculator and see if our cash on cash return or our IR is accurate. They just want to see the numbers, right? Then you can pop over to a PowerPoint and say, okay, here's. Here are the things that are under development or have been developed during testing. They'll. They'll be cool with that. You don't have to show them. You know, basically, you tell them you're done and they're in testing right now. They'll be cool with that. And then a quick look at what's coming. You know, the AI features. Oh, Vinod does think that the AI summary will be ready to go. So we can do a lot of that information, then push the button to show, you know, here it Berends out this big overview. Nobody's going to sit there, read it. Word for word. Really the ideal is to have that portion of the conversation only. Take 10 to 15 minutes. If it goes longer than that. Then it becomes a training session. And you want to avoid that. So if we can kind of come up with an idea. Of what we want, get together. I'll continue to work with the node and the team, and we'll go for that. But I do.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:14:41.950Z)

What do you think of the idea of a video? I don't remember drew remark proposed that, but what are your thoughts on that?

### You (2025-10-29T14:14:45.471Z)

I think. Yeah, no, that's a great idea. Mark brought it up. I definitely think we should have something. On there. Whether I don't think we can afford to have it professionally. Produced. But what Mark showed as an example is very, very common. And I think it's. I think it's. Easily what we should be able to do. Which would be the same thing, but instead of typing in the fields, you basically edit the video and say, okay, fill in these things. And. And so you could easily put together most of them that I see are anywhere from a minute and a half to four minutes. If you go a little. If you go longer than that. It's unbelievable these days. Yeah. To think that somebody can't pay attention for four minutes. But that's just some. The unfortunate truth is that, yeah, you have to get it quickly, but, yeah, we could definitely do that.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:15:41.950Z)

You lose people's attention, right? In today's world. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T14:15:54.271Z)

And we should post that on our website so we can just send an email to somebody say, check this out. What do you think? And then if they want to see more of it, We can get deeper into the weeds, so.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:16:06.750Z)

Okay. I do like that idea. I think it's also a good idea for being able to maybe send out to potential investors. And those clients that Drew and Mark have in their mind that they want a demo too, right? As almost just like a first quick whiz passed and let them see something. It also gives us something to, like, keep momentum going. Why we while we actually work on what we want the demo to look to the script of the actual demo in the half hour call. Right? Because to your point, we shouldn't be spending a half hour at least at this point, because it's still in the MVP stage. It's not like we're in a V3 or something like that where. Right. We're. We're showing someone. We're still kind of getting our initial customers and investors lined up.

### You (2025-10-29T14:16:38.751Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:16:57.710Z)

Okay? I love that. Yeah, definitely want to do that. So do you think just warn me. You said you think that Drew and I will be in the middle and then you and Mark will be on either end. Did some of that come out yesterday in conversation, or is that just your view of it? Based on all the conversations we've had to date.

### You (2025-10-29T14:17:20.191Z)

I. Yeah, that's just. That's just my. My view, I think, you know, I'm.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:17:23.150Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:17:26.431Z)

As a. As a product manager, I don't want to show. Smoke and mirrors. Or vaporware. I wanted to show what we can really show. But keep it to a minimum. Never over. Promise. Never do this. I. I know, mark. He's, he's. I think he's coming around more than he was before, but I think Mark, you know, with his comments of, you know, I don't want to show it till it's done, I think, you know, he'll probably want to expect more features in a demo. Than. Than less. And I. I know you and Drew are more reasonable in terms of what we can. Demo. As an mvp, so, yeah, I don't think we're way far apart. I just think, you know, that's. That's something where we need to be.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:18:10.510Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:18:15.791Z)

And like I said, I think.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:18:16.110Z)

Just trying to get a sense if you think it's going to be stalemate, as things can be, or if you think that, like, we can somehow figure out how to work through it and collegial way.

### You (2025-10-29T14:18:19.391Z)

No. Yeah, and. I. I still keep falling back on that. If. If Mark is not comfortable demoing it, then he can wait until he is. We can go out and demo does mean we're not. We're not. He doesn't need to approve. What we do. So, you know, if. If he disagrees, then fine. Wait until it's ready.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:18:49.870Z)

That's me. I may be taking it too far. Too far. Right? Like, how was yesterday? Did. Was it a good call? Was it?

### You (2025-10-29T14:18:55.871Z)

It was. It was. It was short. The node was able to join, but he couldn't be on camera. And so really, it was just primarily Jew and myself going through where we are, what needs to be done. We talked about. Testing. So Drew put together a little worksheet that we can use because. He and I both are like, okay, I. I don't remember if I told these guys that this isn't working before, and we're all kind of coming over with the same thing, so we're trying to make the. The review as efficient as possible. And that's about it. You know, we talked about the AI Augmented.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:19:43.950Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:19:47.951Z)

And I kind of reiterated Drew's email. I think he kind of misunderstood, thinking that we wanted to stop what we're doing and then pivot to this AI augmented. And, you know, I reassured him that, no, that's like version one or even later. I'm just trying to get things documented right now. And. And make sure that we're ready to go. So that's really about all we talked about. So your was there, so you should have some notes on it. I hope so.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:20:17.310Z)

And then I did see. Yeah. Yeah, I should. I just haven't checked yet because I'm still a little bit under the weather, and I did see something about, like, the.

### You (2025-10-29T14:20:20.911Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:20:29.790Z)

Pitch deck and the LLC agreement and like a handful of other things that were business related. Did you guys just mention it? And that it so picked up in the bot? Okay, all right.

### You (2025-10-29T14:20:41.471Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Benod asked about the status of the llc, Drew mentioned that he didn't have a chance to get with you over the weekend and still needed that final review. For the llc. That's. Yeah, there's just something that was mentioned briefly.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:21:02.190Z)

And then just to help me understand back channeling for a moment, I mean, do you think the LLC is going to be contentious? Is there, like, conversation behind the scenes that it's not well done or it's over legalesed or anything like. I'm just trying to gauge, like, you know, how prepared I need to be for if it's going to be like a, you know, a hellacious discussion or if it's going to be just a, you know, like it was originally, like, we just needed, you know, a few things updated.

### You (2025-10-29T14:21:13.231Z)

No. No. No.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:21:32.350Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:21:32.511Z)

I think. I think the. The only thing now is for you and Drew to come to an agreement with what you wanted to add in. There. And once that's done, it's more about wanting to finish it. Than any particular points in it. So, you know, once you and Drew finish it, Mark has been pretty silent. He hasn't really said one thing. One way or the other.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:22:00.270Z)

Which worries me, actually.

### You (2025-10-29T14:22:02.751Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:22:03.470Z)

Like that. Yeah. I mean, that just. Especially after. Well, anyway. But it worries me, like, maybe he's using Drew to, like, you know, like, behind the scenes, and that's why it's taking so long for Drew to get through it as well. But I don't know.

### You (2025-10-29T14:22:08.511Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. But that. That's why I think that. I mean, even if he is that, that. That's fine. Because then when you and Drew kind of, you know.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:22:29.470Z)

To down.

### You (2025-10-29T14:22:29.631Z)

You know, give it. Give it the thumbs up. You know, Vanya, we're. We're good with it. We'll just. We just want to get it done. So I think. I think we'll be fine. So. Yeah, the sooner you can get withdrew, the better.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:22:38.270Z)

Load, okay. Okay? Got it. And then the pitch deck is super important to me. But I realize we're probably recording all of this, but I may take a stab at just trying to do a few slides in that pitch deck, just get my own account to pop, AI, just so that if I have to talk to a couple people, I. Have something that's finished and they won't be Mark's people, but, you know, like, I feel like I'm missing opportunities and the female funded space to secure funding maybe sooner than later. And if I, if I, if I could tackle some of that, I might be able to at least get a couple. Hundred K in on top of Driftwood's funding.

### You (2025-10-29T14:23:19.311Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:23:24.350Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:23:24.351Z)

And. And I think you and I talked about this before, and I fully agree. We should put everything in the pitch deck. And then remove pages. Depending on the audience. So. Rather than having multiple versions or argument about what does go in, what doesn't go in, just put everything in. And if you think that's a slide is inappropriate or not needed, just take it out for whoever you're talking to. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:23:54.190Z)

Appropriate. Yeah. Okay? Okay? Got it. Okay. And I haven't had a chance to. I mean, my whole. These things are super important. I know you have your own thing, but these infographics. I just haven't had a chance. And I don't think I need to write this moment again. I just need it probably before the end of the. Year. I'll figure it out. Might be what I do over Christmas, if I have time.

### You (2025-10-29T14:24:27.791Z)

I. I haven't played with it either, but I did send out a link to a new tool that I found.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:24:30.430Z)

No, you don't have time either. And, yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T14:24:35.071Z)

At creates info graphics off of a prompt. That I didn't. I didn't try it. I just saw an advertisement for it and thought, well, okay, I'll pass it along. But yeah, infographics and marketing aren't my thing, so I probably.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:24:38.350Z)

Love it.

### You (2025-10-29T14:24:50.911Z)

Won't even try to do anything with it, so, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:24:53.870Z)

Nope. All good. All good. It's on me, so. And I just wanted. It's. I just. My time has been much more limited. Because I've explained this, right? It's like 40 hours plus 30 hours equals no more hours.

### You (2025-10-29T14:25:00.031Z)

Yeah, yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Yeah, no, I get it.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:25:10.270Z)

For now. At least it won't be that way forever.

### You (2025-10-29T14:25:12.591Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:25:13.710Z)

Okay. And you're still with me, right? You still feel good about everything and, like. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T14:25:17.151Z)

Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, bumps in the road are gonna be expected, so. No, I'm. I'm really happy with the way that my biggest concern was the data extraction. Given our experience at RedIQ and the limitations that I'm fully aware of with the technology, And so that's why I. Really want the entire dev team to focus strictly on that. So that's why I know when Drew goes in and tests and he sees that, you know, there's something that hasn't changed since the last time he was in there. It's like. That's okay. We don't need the button to be moved or changes me to this until I can get that data extraction. And they are making very, very good strides on that. So once we're comfortable with that,

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:26:15.710Z)

What does that mean for. Because I know that, like, you're a conservative person. And so when I hear you say that, I have a lot of trust and faith in it. What does and for laymen, making progress, does that mean. Our accuracy is 60%. Our accuracy is 80%. I shouldn't even think about accuracy. There's a better way to. Word it, you know, to describe the success we're making and the progress we're making week over week.

### You (2025-10-29T14:26:49.071Z)

That's exactly what it's. It's measured by. The success rate. And success rate means. You've uploaded a document. You've extracted the data, and the data is in the correct spot. So. You know, the. You get a lot of these. Statements that might just be year to date and then a forecast to the end of the year, or it could just be trailing 12. I mean, there's a lot of differences, and you have to have a tool that can recognize and say, Okay, this statement goes through August of 2025. And therefore. It's. If there's nothing beyond it, then you can say, okay, well, this is a trailing 12, so I will upload that, but not as an annual statement. And that's what this whole year, zero. Conversation was about. So, you know, there's always a lag. Here we are in October. The most recent financial statement you could possibly have is through September, although we are past the 15th. So maybe you can get, or excuse, yeah, September for being mid October, maybe August. And then how do you determine what you have to forecast to get your 2025 for year zero and then year one, two, three, four, five, etcetera? It's both the logic of making sure that you've got the time period correct as well as mapping the numbers. And you have to be in the upper 90%. In order to go out to the market and say, we can extract your. Data. With accuracy. You know, if 1 out of 10 financial statements fail, That's not good. They're not going to trust the system now. There will always be failures. We monitored every document at rediq that was uploaded. And remember, with RedIQ, you upload financial statements and rent rolls. And we were having people that would upload a rent roll into the financial statement, vice versa, or they would upload a rent roll. Which would be a scan. Of a document with handwriting on it or things like that. Those things you will never be able to stop. And we'll do the same. We'll track it, and so we'll know why something failed. So if somebody calls up and says, your product sucks because I uploaded this, and we can go back and say, oh, well, you know what? You changed everything or you had handwriting over it, which threw everything off. You got to upload a clean document. And as long as we keep. Pressing that to our users, we'll be fine, but. Yeah. If they upload a perfectly good document and for some reason we can't extract it, then the confidence is lost and we have to figure out what's going on. So we'll. We'll make sure that. That we get up there.

What would you say it is now?

### You (2025-10-29T14:30:33.951Z)

I think he said we were in the mid-90s. I mean, really, really close. The issues they were having were just some of the formatting. You know, they keep talking about the Ambridge, how there are different format. You've got other ones. My concern is, you know, we've, we've got a lot of financial statements to test, but they're from a relatively small group of users. I'm sure they're very representative. But we're going to get some mom and pop or we're going to get somebody who's got something formatted in the first time through, it's going to fail. And so, you know, we have to let people know.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:31:01.150Z)

Yes. Yes, they are. A hundred. Right.

### You (2025-10-29T14:31:17.071Z)

We'll have to come up with you some documentation and faq or, you know, when we onboard a new client, we'll have to let them know that we haven't seen your operating savings yet. So, you know, we. One of the things we should do is to get samples from them during the sales process. So that we can be prepared for it, but.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:31:36.750Z)

Yes. Yes. And even, and even before that. Right. Because unlike multifamily and I'm sure you enjoy, there really is a finite number of hotel management companies. Right. They don't. And it's really, there is a green book that is established with the top hundred management companies, which, I mean, really with networking, we should be able to at least get their form. And then where the problems typically come that I've seen isn't with the bigger management companies because they're more sophisticated. And we can, and I believe we can handle it. It's with the mom and pops, but the mom and Pops are affiliated by an organization. Called ahoa, which is the American Asian Hospitality Owners Association. And it is a very solid organization, clearly of Indian hotel investors. There's also one for Latino hotel investors as well. And through these organizations, if we're thoughtful, right, we can leverage the leadership, I think, of these organizations to kind of help us get the samples. That we need and understand where the problem mapping could lie and things like that. Right. It doesn't mean we have to go out to 50 different management companies that are Indian. We can work through a HOA to try to solve that challenge as can we work through. There's not as many Latino owned management hotel management companies. But does that make sense? There are. And we can work through the American Hospitality and Lodging Association. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T14:33:01.711Z)

Right. Yeah. No, what. What that tells me is we need to get some very close relationships with them. Sponsor conference or be a sponsor or really partner with them.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:33:21.710Z)

Yes. Yes, yes. Right.

### You (2025-10-29T14:33:30.191Z)

Because. If they are establishing standards. And they say if you do this, InnVestAI can assist you. I mean, they could be another sales team for us.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:33:45.790Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-10-29T14:33:47.551Z)

So, yeah, we would definitely want to make sure that we work very closely with them.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:33:47.790Z)

Yes. Right. And AHOA as an organization. Their membership somehow is invested in a property management system called M3, which is one of the like it's. I mean it needed upgraded, which is why I think a whole invested in it. But it generates a P and L, right? And a HOA. The organization is an investor in M3, so you can just really start to see the lineage. We build a relationship with a hoa. We get in and, like, start to work with them three directly, right? But I go back to I need the pitch deck, right? To be able to go to a HOA and kind of say, like, this is what we're doing. This is what our vision is. This is. You know, I can backchannel that. There's a lot of women that are involved with running those organizations.

### You (2025-10-29T14:34:17.471Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be great. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:34:43.630Z)

Anyway, I didn't mean to digress. I just.

### You (2025-10-29T14:34:45.631Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:34:47.070Z)

I do believe there are these leverage points within the hospitality industry that we just approach them correctly, it could almost be like, exponential for us and the leverage and the success we have with data and transfer and documentation, things like that. But mid-90s is good. Mid-90s is for where we are, right? That's really good. That's not like it's 40 or 50%.

### You (2025-10-29T14:35:06.511Z)

Makes sense. No, they're. They're doing very well. So.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:35:18.590Z)

And clearly that's annual data, because that's really the only thing we've directed them to focus on at this point.

### You (2025-10-29T14:35:24.591Z)

Yeah, yeah. But they have had some of those documents, you know, that show from January through month to date. Or year to date and then the forecast for the rest of the year, and they were able to identify. Which is which. So that's a very strong step to where we need to be to get the monthly data. Instead of just one column of annual data. So. So, yeah, that'll. That'll be very helpful.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:35:53.150Z)

Okay? Okay? All right, very good, then. If you see a couple of wild emails, just fly out there to Will and to Jim Alderman. Just know they're just friends just chatting with. And it'll probably be a Tuesday or Thursday, since those are the only days that I technically have off. Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T14:36:17.711Z)

Yeah, no, that's fine. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:36:20.030Z)

All right. Have a good day.

### You (2025-10-29T14:36:21.471Z)

Okay? You too. So you say. Are you permanently, like, Tuesday, Thursday off, at least for the time being?

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:36:24.270Z)

Bye. Yeah, for the next six months. When I say off, those are my driftwood days. So I'm not standing behind a cash register at Kroger. Right. And I can, like, slip in calls. So can we just move this to Tuesday at 10:00am.

### You (2025-10-29T14:36:31.551Z)

Okay? Right. That's what I was. That's why I was gonna ask, because it's still on the calendar for Mondays. And Tuesdays are fine for me as well, if you want to just go ahead and slide it a day where we'll be good.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:36:49.390Z)

Great. I'll just move it. Okay, I'll just move it to Tuesdays then.

### You (2025-10-29T14:36:52.911Z)

Okay? All right. All right.

### Guest (2025-10-29T14:36:55.470Z)

Thanks, Howard. Bye.

### You (2025-10-29T14:36:56.591Z)

See ya. Bye.
