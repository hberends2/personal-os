# Transcript for: Howard | Vinod weekly call

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:30:38.895Z)

Hello? Hello? How are you?

### You (2025-09-15T21:30:43.775Z)

Doing all right. How about yourself?

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:30:46.575Z)

Doing all right as well. How are you feeling? Now.

### You (2025-09-15T21:30:50.735Z)

Had a little. Quick reference this afternoon. But cleared up after an hour or two.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:30:59.455Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T21:31:01.055Z)

Yeah, Nothing major. Just.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:31:07.695Z)

Yeah. I also had some cold, bad throat, fever and all that, but not much. All good.

### You (2025-09-15T21:31:19.695Z)

Yeah, my wife had that last. Tuesday. Yeah, day after Labor Day. Because she was upset that it was the first day of class for one of her classes, but she had a fever of, like, 102. And they say there's more. Another strain of Covid going around. We didn't bother.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:31:36.255Z)

Oh, that's not good.

### You (2025-09-15T21:31:42.095Z)

We didn't bother doing the test.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:31:42.575Z)

Yeah. As well. And yeah, I had in the family, like, my son had some infection, then my daughter, then my wife, and I was the last one to get it.

### You (2025-09-15T21:31:46.335Z)

But yeah. That's the good thing about kids. They like to share all their sore throats and sneezes and everything. Been there.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:32:01.615Z)

Right. What's going on with Mark and Diane? And what was the meeting? About?

### You (2025-09-15T21:32:14.015Z)

Well, they were separate meetings. I have a call every Monday morning with Diane. So we were talking about that, and then Mark called right after that. He took a little bit of disagreement with the email that I sent this morning. About the AI hype.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:32:36.975Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T21:32:39.615Z)

Cycle. Yeah, I had to talk him down from that. So. Not a big deal, but he still feels that we need to focus in all of our marketing has to focus on AI. We have to be selling the AI and. Bring them back into the AI is a feature. But it's not our core product. I had to explain to them. We don't build and sell AI. We build and sell an abm. I reiterated that we're not going to put AI products. In the model. Just to say we have AI that every single thing that we put in there has to prove that it's either faster, easier, cheaper, more accurate.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:33:23.135Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T21:33:34.335Z)

It's going to have to meet these requirements. He kept pushing back, but then I think he finally realized that we were really on the same page. He was focusing on their view because I told him, I said, look, from a marketing standpoint or from a sales standpoint. Yeah, push the AI. I mean, that's got to be part of the sales process. But it's not something that. Our product is not an AI product. Our product is an evaluation model that has AI features. And he just kind of, like, couldn't wrap his head around that. And then he brought up that email that I sent about the equity. With Diane and everything, and he's opposed to it. He doesn't want to do it, so I told him. And, you know, if we didn't have 100%, I wasn't going to push it.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:34:29.855Z)

And you know what last after we had our last call I had these thought of why True and Mark are getting equal equities. They are barely involved. Like what are they doing for investai on day to day basis? Their involvement is probably just joining one call a week for one hour and I don't think let's say they are investing. Probably, I don't know, not more than three, four hours.

### You (2025-09-15T21:34:45.055Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:35:03.135Z)

Weak, right?

### You (2025-09-15T21:35:03.775Z)

Yeah. Drew has been putting in quite a bit of time. But he does have his own business to run.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:35:15.135Z)

So both of these guys, right, they run two, three different businesses. So what is the commitment we can expect from them in future as well, right? Suppose we had an office. They come eight hours in InnVestAI office.

### You (2025-09-15T21:35:24.895Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:35:29.135Z)

And devote their full time.

### You (2025-09-15T21:35:32.655Z)

I believe he would. Larc. No. I hate to say it, but I just. LARC provides very little value. I know why Diane wanted him involved. But. She was, you know, she thinks that he's got all the connections in the industry and can get funds. But Diane probably at the time didn't realize that probably a minority of the investing that we end up getting. In at, you know, three or four years from now. It's not going to be hotel investors and operators. It's going to be capitalists and other funding organizations. You know, call it venture capital, call it whatever. I. I don't believe that we would ever. Be fully funded by industry experts. Therefore, Marks value, I don't think is anywhere near what Diane thought it would be. And, and Diane and I talk about this before that if she had a chance to start over again, I don't think she would have split evenly. And I think Mark's compensation would have been based on a commission. That his revenue is income to be based on how much money he raises. So, you know, right now, he. Right now.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:37:07.295Z)

Right. All right. Masa, your second do.

### You (2025-09-15T21:37:11.615Z)

Right now. He can sit back, put his foot up on the desk and collect money. If we were fully operational. It is what it is. But, yeah, I think I kind of expected him to push back. But. I think Diane may, or maybe it was even Drew, made the comment that Mark kind of feels like he's the most important person in this organization. And definitely has an ego issue. So I can see. I mean, you saw how he started arguing with Diane on the call before. I can see where there's gonna.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:37:46.175Z)

Llar.

### You (2025-09-15T21:37:56.175Z)

Honestly, you know, it could be he and I. It could be j in him. You know, he even drew my punch in it, because I think it was Drew that mention that, because he's been working with Mark on some of these. Like the. The safe, documents and everything else. So I know that the three have of them have been having quite a few calls. But honestly, I still think I do know that Mark and Drew have been working on the pitch deck. But how many hours he's putting in that, I don't know. Maybe Drew was doing all the work and he's just reviewing. I don't know, but. He still is kind of in that. I'm not going to reach out to my friends until I feel the product is working. I don't know. I don't know. I just. You know, it's. I don't dislike him. But I really starting to lose confidence in him and really feel that, you know, if we had to rank each one of us in terms of priority, who provides the most value to the organization? He would definitely be number five.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:39:20.495Z)

Yeah. And value, and then also the commitment, right?

### You (2025-09-15T21:39:26.015Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:39:26.655Z)

I don't know. What commitment can we expect?

### You (2025-09-15T21:39:26.735Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:39:29.375Z)

From him in future. Even if he'll be involved in sales, he should have certain target or something set so that we can say he's adding value. He's just attending a call once away. But, I mean, I don't know what we can do about it now.

### You (2025-09-15T21:39:56.655Z)

Yeah, I think it's. Yeah. I don't think Diane would ever have the courage to stand up and say anything. That's one of the problems. I think Diane is just too nice. Yeah, and I'm concerned about that, so.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:40:12.415Z)

And even compensation wise, right? I think we should give the compensation based on what's your commitment like? How much time are you putting in? If you are not putting in any time, why are you getting equal compensation as anyone else?

### You (2025-09-15T21:40:22.015Z)

Yeah. Well, here's the thing about the compensation, though. We did talk about that today because she she's been circulating her budget for some comments. And the whole thing about everybody getting equal amount of compensation at the beginning is just because, number one, there's a very good possibility that we can't pay anybody a salary. Yet. Until we get to, you know, at least a precede or series A that anybody who's going to be investing money now is they're not going to be writing us a check. So that we can give ourselves money. It's got to be put into it so. On paper, we're all getting whatever 150k. However, these have been researching, you know, what does a typical cto, cpo, COO get? And she, she, we've already, and she, she's already got it kind of planned out in the three to five year range that at some point none of us will be getting the same pay. Right. And it. And at that point, then it's based on profitability, in fact. The way it would be is like, you'd be at the top pay. I would be second, Drew would be third. And surprisingly, a CEO doesn't get a much salary. They get more of a performance bonus and things like that. And who knows? Maybe at that point, Mark maybe gets a small amount of a salary, and maybe then we can convert him into. No, you don't get a salary. You get a commission based on what you bring in, you know, because I think Diane is kind of looking at him to be kind of the. Seed sales officer. Right. So not only raising money, but also then being in charge of the sales. And that's how salespeople get paid. That could pay on a commission. So, you know, if that's what he wants to do, then his salary will be less than anybody else's, and he can. He can sell. But the thing is, how motivated is is he for that? I don't see him in that position either. He's got his own business. I don't think he ever has any intention of making invest full time, ever.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:42:49.535Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-15T21:43:01.135Z)

So yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:43:03.935Z)

Yeah, that's my concern as well. I don't know about sales, and you'd be able to get in some clients.

### You (2025-09-15T21:43:06.095Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there's more going on with Drew as well. He did lose a client. I don't know that. What's going on with that? So what we're actually talking to. I mean, Diane mentioned this to me. I'm not part of the conversation. I think she and Drew have been talking that when we raised funds, One of the things we may do is just pay off his promissory note that he has to. What is it? Actable or whatever his partner is or whatever. And.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:43:49.775Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-15T21:43:50.895Z)

Just. It becomes part of InnVestAI.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:43:52.575Z)

Merge.

### You (2025-09-15T21:43:53.855Z)

So that way he's not dividing time between his company and us. It's. It would all be invest. We would absorb his existing clients. We would absorb the technology, you know, all of the mapping and everything that he's got set up.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:44:10.255Z)

Okay. And how much is that? That loan.

### You (2025-09-15T21:44:13.935Z)

It's only, like, $45,000.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:44:17.055Z)

Which won't be a bad deal if you get all data, client everything.

### You (2025-09-15T21:44:18.735Z)

Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Now, the thing is, there might be. In addition to the. The 45,000, there might be some type of profit that they were entitled to. You know, I don't think it was just a straight loan. Here's $45,000. We're gonna lend it to you at 7% interest. I think they probably got some other things, so we. May have to do some negotiation, but I think Drew sent out an email to everybody, and he. He just. He attached. I think he. I think he attached the actual note. As an example of a safe note. But I believe it is the actual note. So we could probably read through that and see what else we may have to pay over and above just the note. Either way. I mean, from 45 grand to absorb some clients and, you know, we would just keep that running. It would just be part of investai. You know, I think that would be a great opportunity for us to. Get that. Over and done with, right? So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:45:44.335Z)

Sounds good, Sandra, but road would be like, a good fit for sales as well, right? Because.

### You (2025-09-15T21:45:52.095Z)

I don't know. I don't know. I don't think he's a salesperson. I think that's why his business is suffering. I think he's a good, you know, put. He knows the data. He was an asset manager. But I think he had to struggle to get the clients he has. And something was mentioned way back at the beginning, like February or March time period. That he hasn't had any new clients in the year or so. So I think Diana's looking at him to be the chief operating officer. You know, keep it running. And keep working with us. Marketing or something like that, you know, probably would fall into his review. But I, I think we were. In terms of who was going to be running the sales, I think that's going to be a higher. I don't think. I don't think Mark or Drew are qualified for that. Or Diane. Definitely not me. I'm kind of like, Drew. It's like, yeah, I'm not gonna. I. I can't sell. I'm not going to go out there and pound the pavements. Up.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:47:09.295Z)

I want you to be in the product only. I don't want to go in sales of marketing.

### You (2025-09-15T21:47:12.015Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No, I. I will not do that. I mean, I introduced Carrie to the team, but not as somebody who's going to report to me. Yeah, just.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:47:23.775Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-15T21:47:24.335Z)

Yeah, that's not my thing.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:47:25.615Z)

Yeah, that reminds me. These guys have time. Why don't. I don't know. Why don't they prepare the content for the website? Or some other marketing material as well. Right. Just keep it ready. Then whenever we get time, we work on that development.

### You (2025-09-15T21:47:36.895Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I can tell you it's not going to be Mark. Mark's not going to do a thing. It's like that. Terry is working with Mark.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:47:50.815Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T21:47:50.895Z)

Just to get him some items ready. For the conference in Phoenix. But, you know she's not going to be reporting to Mark.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:48:03.215Z)

Isn't that his own conference? Is that for InnVestAI, though?

### You (2025-09-15T21:48:08.815Z)

That is a conference that I think he's moderating a panel.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:48:13.295Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T21:48:13.295Z)

And he knows a ton of people that are going to be there. So he will use that opportunity to pitch InnVestAI. But, yeah, that's. I mean, he's gonna be doing both. He's gonna be participating, and then he's gonna be. Talking to people, so.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:48:35.535Z)

Is Diane going for that as well?

### You (2025-09-15T21:48:37.615Z)

I think it's only Mark.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:48:39.615Z)

Okay? I was dying would be going as well. She would have made some connections there.

### You (2025-09-15T21:48:43.695Z)

Yeah, yeah. Well, unfortunately, we. I mean, it seems like if we got some funding, Before the end of the month. That I don't see why she can't so. She still wrapping up the deal with that Mike Sherman? And then she's got that deal with the father and son. I keep. I need to put their name in there. Either one of them could be writing a check here within the next week or two. But. But, yeah, I agree. It'd be really nice if she was there, so.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:49:23.935Z)

Right, right, right.

### You (2025-09-15T21:49:24.415Z)

But. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:49:29.295Z)

Yeah, from the engineering thing, I think we have some good lead on the extraction now. The only part was we were having some issues with throttling is kind of saying, oh, you have sent too many requests or something. Something. Trying to resolve that.

### You (2025-09-15T21:49:47.215Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:49:48.415Z)

But, yeah, I think we are getting some good extraction done with high accuracy, which is great.

### You (2025-09-15T21:49:52.895Z)

Good. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:49:58.735Z)

I was also thinking, I don't know if these guys understand, like, how complicated the extraction can be. Initially when True said he'll send the data right in Excel. His data was straightforward. That was like I was able to extract the entirely with Python script without any AI or anything. But I mean, the kind of document we have, those are complicated in this structure, right? It might have less data, but its structure is very complicated. Like three headers. This, that here for machinery is like, bit complicated.

### You (2025-09-15T21:50:23.295Z)

Yeah. From my understanding, the data that he gave us is he gets the financial data from his client. He copies and pastes that data. Into his bottle that then maps that data. To his standardized chart of accounts. And that's what he gave us was the data that was already mapped. So Diane and I spoke about that again. This weird that she keeps me brought it up the same things. She, she didn't understand why we just didn't have Guru process the financial statements. And, you know, I explained to her that, you know, what he's doing is copying and pasting into this model. So what we would be doing is extracting the data from the financials. Then he would use that, and we could use his mapping tool. To get everything standardized, but we can't copy. Have somebody copy and paste the data. Manually like that. You know? Cause he was talking about that. I remember. You know, he talked about how difficult it was, but once he got it set up, It was fine. So the initial setup was there, but, you know, he's in the same situation. If somebody adds a new line item or if there's a change that doesn't match his mapping, he has to go in and change it. But it doesn't happen that often, so he has the same clients. Each time he gets a financial from them. It's formatted the same as last month, so now it's easy. Copy, paste, map. Power bi. No. No big deal. But, yeah, we can't. We can't do that.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:52:18.175Z)

Right? Yeah. I was just thinking that I hope these guys understand the extraction is complicated, and that's why it's kind of taking a little time.

### You (2025-09-15T21:52:31.215Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:52:32.895Z)

That's the piece really kind of remaining on the MVV version, or probably, you know, we could do more than mvp, but just extraction is taken some time in produce. Take a little more time.

### You (2025-09-15T21:52:43.695Z)

Yeah. We should probably. Maybe in tomorrow's column, maybe you do a little demo, but not just showing, you know, I drag and drop here, push the button and pull it. I mean, maybe you should have some type of. An infographic of the steps. You know what happens after we drop it in there and push the button? I agree. I think. I think they just probably think that AI is taking all the information and putting it where it has to go. And we're just using ChatGPT. And why is it of an issue? Right. I think that's a good idea if you could do something like that. If tomorrow's too soon. You know, we can do it on our Thursday call.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:53:37.135Z)

Yeah, that's would be better. And with this tomorrow, I was thinking if I could show some extraction, that would probably give them some more confidence that, you know, we are heading in the right direction.

### You (2025-09-15T21:53:52.735Z)

Yeah. So maybe tomorrow we just show them that what's happening? But then set the stage for Thursday that maybe we'll do a little bit of a deeper dive. And you just basically have to educate everybody. What's going on? And explain to them. What's not working and why it's not working. What are the hurdles that we have? What are the difficulties and the risks?

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:54:20.895Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T21:54:21.935Z)

Because I don't think. You know, I don't think any of them. Understand the process at all.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:54:27.055Z)

Yeah. All right? And I kind of assume they understand in the last call when. True, sir. We don't even know what you are doing. We know what we are doing. You don't know what you are doing.

### You (2025-09-15T21:54:42.255Z)

I think that would be a good idea. Yeah. And if you want help on, you know, an infographic or putting together something like that, idea can help with that as well. So I did. I am ready to go over the formulas with the team.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:55:01.455Z)

Okay, great. Tomorrow.

### You (2025-09-15T21:55:03.535Z)

Yeah. So I totally rearranged that PRD or not, that none of the formulas document, because when I did it, I did it in order of basically the process, you know?

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:55:08.815Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T21:55:20.895Z)

Put together the deal. Then upload the documents and then put in your valuation assumptions and do all of this other things. But it's not really the way that the formulas were laid out. It wasn't laid out that way. So I rearranged everything, put it in the order. Of which they would want to develop it. So we basically start with a pro forma page, you know, because that feeds the cards at the top in the metrics table. So I will go through all of that. And so like those cards at the top of the page in the metrics table would be later in the development process because there's really no calculations there, they're just displaying data that was shown elsewhere. So I still need to get some screens hots for those items. But the pro forma, that whole section is ready to go, so we can do that. Another thing I'd like to show tomorrow is I changed the PoC so that the occupancy, revenue and expenses are on separate pages instead of one big scrolling item. Because Drew also mentioned one thing I haven't done yet is he would like every one of those line items to have the cost per key. Which is very simple. But then that's going to take up thing that's already big. And make it way bigger. So the occupancy and revenue are both very small in terms of input. Right. Revenue has four lines. Occupancy just has a couple. And then expenses are down below, and I'm thinking, we've got that. KPI table that has the four tabs, one for the key metrics, that has your gop, your ebitda. Couple other things. Noi I mean those are the rows that every time you make a change. Those are the items you're going to want to look and see. What happened? But then you've got your occupancy tab, then you've got your revenue and expenses, and they all have the care to expand. So everything you need is in that metrics table. So it doesn't matter if I have different pages. So I created another version of the POC this morning, and I split those out, and it's so much easier to use. When it's split out like that. So it doesn't change anything in the development. It's just basically, instead of having everything on the 1 performa tab, you now have a tab called Penetration and Revenue Analysis or to page and then another page called Expense Analysis. And there's no more expanding in the sidebar and clicking to navigate to go over here, you just click go to the page. That's it. So I think makes the sidebar easier. Makes the user experience better. And hopefully I don't think we're to the point yet where that's going to have to make anybody go back. I don't think that you've done anything on the pro forma yet, have you?

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:58:45.615Z)

For my. I'll show it to you real quick. Yeah. So current performer, something like this. So if I click on this performer analysis, So this opens a new tab.

### You (2025-09-15T21:59:07.535Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:59:07.695Z)

And this. This how it was like we are thinking, right? I mean, I'll push it. No changes. But it was done. But then, yeah, we can go over whatever new POC created.

### You (2025-09-15T21:59:17.295Z)

Yeah. Ok? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:59:22.255Z)

And then probably made the changes.

### You (2025-09-15T21:59:24.975Z)

Is that in the Dev. Okay. Yeah, I've got Dev open right now, so I'll. I'll take a look. But. Yeah. So you. Yeah, you still have it set up the way the original POC was, where the revenue has the carrot and then you've got the subcategories underneath. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-15T21:59:41.295Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T21:59:42.335Z)

Simple, simple fix. And we don't have to do it. Maybe we do with some A B testing. When we do start testing it. So maybe we just let keep going the way you've been doing. We'll see. Yeah, I'll show everybody tomorrow. And we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:00:06.015Z)

What about? What do you think about that thing? Was invited someone in last meeting, right? I think that's very easily doable in house. If they are charging 5,000, we can charge 3,000, and we can really make that if we have clients.

### You (2025-09-15T22:00:27.375Z)

Remind me. I kind of remember what you're talking about.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:00:32.015Z)

What was that thing called in the last call. Right. Diane had invited someone from outside.

### You (2025-09-15T22:00:37.615Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:00:40.015Z)

And then he showed a marketing material, right?

### You (2025-09-15T22:00:43.055Z)

Oh, yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:00:45.615Z)

The browser type of thing.

### You (2025-09-15T22:00:46.735Z)

Yeah, I, I talk to diane. She is two years ahead. On on that. She thinks that we could sell something like that. Two hour clients. But. We don't have that. That's why I kind of mentioned that call that we could populate, you know, some of the financial data. But all those other pages. That's a broker's offering memorandum.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:01:10.895Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T22:01:15.695Z)

And I don't know where else she thought. We could use that. But I was thinking the same thing you were thinking. I'm glad you brought it up, because we could do something like that for, like, our investment summary or our investor packages. Things that we were just going to print to a PDF. You're right. I agree. We could. We. We could build the same thing in house. We wouldn't have to partner with anybody. So I think she just saw something online and she thought it was really cool and was trying to figure out how we could incorporate it. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:01:58.175Z)

Cool. Yeah. Something that fits our clients need, right? Yeah, that's definitely a broker thing.

### You (2025-09-15T22:02:05.295Z)

Yeah, yeah. Well, that's the thing. She. She probably went on for 20 minutes this morning, showing me just one slide that she has in the pitch deck. And basically what it was, it was just kind of a brain dump of all the products and services InnVestAI can can use.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:02:17.055Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T22:02:26.895Z)

And so many of them were, like, three to five years out. And she. Even she. She knew it. It wasn't like she was expecting all this to be done in the next 12 months. And I, you know, I kind of pointed all of them, and she was okay with that. But we do need some of that. You know, our investors, they're gonna want to know what is our three to five year roadmap. So it wasn't like she wasted time, but, yeah, she had. She's. She's. Got a lot of stuff like that that she's got on there.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:02:57.855Z)

That's fine.

### You (2025-09-15T22:02:58.495Z)

It's like, you know, we'll add it to the list. But it's gonna be a while before we can do anything like that. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:03:07.935Z)

Right. Yeah, man. If we can sell something, which is easily, we can build and sell, then we can, you know, expand our offshore team. We can add more guys. So anything that is sellable can generate income.

### You (2025-09-15T22:03:22.655Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:03:26.735Z)

We should just think of doing in house.

### You (2025-09-15T22:03:27.135Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. We've got plenty of things that we could do in house. I don't. I don't really feel that we need to partner on hardly anything anymore. You know, AI has made it to the point where, in fact. So. So you know that CRM that I've been working on?

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:03:49.855Z)

Right? Right. Right.

### You (2025-09-15T22:03:50.575Z)

Right. So I found that new tool that I told you about called Diane, which is basically a no code tool, but it resides on your laptop and you just use your API key. So I connect it to Claude, I'm using the Claud code. And I've seen plenty of articles and videos where they say, well, I just asked it to replicate X video or X website, and it created a perfect thing. So I thought, all right, I'm gonna try this. So I put in a prompt. I said, build me a fully functional CRM based on HubSpot. And like with it was it took six minutes. And it did a perfect Even had the HubSpot logo. I mean, okay, I didn't want that. But it's like six minutes, and I had this, and I'm looking at it. And all of a sudden, I realized that the template that I was using before. Was almost identical to this HubSpot, but it's like, okay, somebody did that. They. They went in and said, build me a replica of HubSpot. They made a few changes and are now out there promoting it as their own. And. But. But when I did that, I was thinking, you know, this is so easy. And so now I've got a CRM that looks exactly what I've already shown everybody, but has more features in it because it just replicated what was HubSpot. I didn't have to rebuild those. You can do that for so many things out there. It's like, yeah, it's the days of the big SaaS providers and all these things.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:05:43.615Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T22:05:45.935Z)

Are gone. It's like nobody's gonna have to pay the big bucks anymore when you can just put in a prompt and get a fully functioning version.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:05:55.695Z)

That's true, that's true.

### You (2025-09-15T22:05:58.335Z)

All right. So. All right. Anything else?

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:03.535Z)

No, not really.

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:04.335Z)

Okay? Did you set up the call for tomorrow with the team?

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:08.735Z)

Yeah, I'll set up that.

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:10.175Z)

Okay. Yeah, I was gonna say I don't remember seeing the invite yet.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:12.735Z)

Your current is up to date, right?

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:13.695Z)

But yeah. Yeah, I'm wide open tomorrow. So, yeah, whatever works for the team.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:17.215Z)

Great. Thank you. Sounds good. Sounds good.

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:21.935Z)

Well, I take that back. I do have one call that was added, but it's later in the afternoon. It'll be the middle of the night there time. So we're. We're good.

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:29.695Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:30.655Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-15T22:06:33.535Z)

All right. Thank you.

### You (2025-09-15T22:06:35.055Z)

All right. Have a good night.
