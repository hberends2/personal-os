# Transcript for: catch up

### You (2025-09-11T15:01:01.789Z)

How you doing?

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:01:03.468Z)

Good. Happy Thursday.

### You (2025-09-11T15:01:04.589Z)

Yeah. Happy Thursday. Hold on a second here while. I close out a couple tabs.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:01:25.468Z)

And I will the transaction volume stuff to you this afternoon.

### You (2025-09-11T15:01:30.589Z)

Oh, okay. Yeah, I was just gonna. Keep moving forward with.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:01:36.348Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-11T15:01:39.309Z)

Doing some research on it as well. Cool. So how's everything going?

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:01:47.628Z)

Eah, weeks. But you guys are probably gathering that from my temperament. All right, so let's dive in. I'm going to be as emotionally neutral as I can be, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:01:57.469Z)

To be.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:02:03.708Z)

And I really want to listen.

### You (2025-09-11T15:02:06.109Z)

Here.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:02:06.588Z)

Because, Howard, you were the one. You have this superpower skill of explaining things to people in a way here. And so that's what I want to understand today. Blame this to me. In a way, you're getting it, but I'm not. But I want to be able to really Howard, if that makes sense.

### You (2025-09-11T15:02:27.469Z)

Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah, it was kind of a disturbing call. Because clearly yourself and Mark. We're not connecting. So Mark wasn't listening, and you were having a difficult time understanding Mark. I was having a difficult time. I wanted to jump in because I felt the same way you did. It's like how? Can we get somebody to write us a check? Without them getting something in return. Because what bothered me the most in that conversation was when we asked Mark about, well, what do these early investors get? What are they doing? And he made a comment about, well, they're getting in on the ground floor, this great opportunity. And I'm like, Thinking to myself, okay, does that mean they get a plaque to put on the wall and that's it? Congratulations for investing in investai. And so I wanted to jump in and ask them kind of the same thing.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:03:37.068Z)

And I realized I wasn't. I was probably over talking Mark too, so that's a fair thing to say. Why? His frustration was rising because I wasn't listening to him.

### You (2025-09-11T15:03:45.949Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:03:49.388Z)

So what are they saying, though? That I'm missing? That has merit.

### You (2025-09-11T15:03:52.669Z)

So. Here's basically the bottom line. As I was thinking about this. If somebody writes us a check, They're going to want one of two things. They're going to want to earn interest. In other words, it's a loan. Or they're going to want equity. So that they get their money back plus a return on their investment. And the way Mark was explaining it. Didn't. By not putting a value on there, you have no baseline to determine whether or not there's a return on their investment. So I'm thinking, yeah, you have to have a valuation. And then I had a call with Drew yesterday on a different subject. But then I asked him about what he thought of the situation, and I told him what I thought, and he said yeah. That's what is the most confusing thing, is that a safe note is a loan. And so I think. Where the confusion lies is that the way that his safe note was written up is that they do accrue interest. If the deal is sold for less than their investment. Right. So if they put in $50,000 and we padlock the doors and walk away. We still owe them $50,000, plus some interest. But it also contains a clause that says if we raise equity capital, At which point you have to have a valuation. In order to have equity investments. Evaluation.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:05:56.588Z)

Series a, right? That's series a.

### You (2025-09-11T15:06:03.469Z)

Somebody says, no, I don't want to do a safe note, I have to do this. Then we are assigning a value to our company. At that point, the safe note would convert to equity. And they get a discount on there. So basically, we would say that you would get an X percent of equity. When we reach y percent of valuation, right? At that point, it converts to equity. So that's why we would not put a valuation in a safe note. So that started me thinking about your conversations with Mike and how he is wanting to assign evaluation. He wants equity from day one. So that could cause a conflict with a safe note. Because at that point, we're assigning a valuation. So if we accept, let's say, worst case scenario, somebody says, yeah, I want to write you a half a million dollar check. On a safe note. And Mike says, I'm going to give you $50,000 for 10%. What? We just now valued the deal at half a million dollars. The equity amount, then.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:07:41.548Z)

It's too dilutive.

### You (2025-09-11T15:07:42.829Z)

Would convert.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:07:44.348Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:07:45.389Z)

Basically a half million dollar investment. On a half million dollar, they would own 100% of the deal.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:07:51.868Z)

Right. It's what right? That's why we might can't get for 50k. He can't get 10% of the company. I know that and I've told him that, so we're working through it. So is that the point, though, that we're miss is in your opinion, was Monday our disconnect all about valuation?

### You (2025-09-11T15:08:16.669Z)

I think it was about valuation. The fine print of a safe note.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:08:25.628Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T15:08:30.989Z)

It's almost like. Yeah, I agree with both of you.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:08:34.988Z)

Great.

### You (2025-09-11T15:08:36.509Z)

Yeah, we would have to have a valuation if we are giving equity right off the bat in exchange for money. But if we're doing safe notes, Then there is no valuation at all. It is a loan. But it's a convertible loan.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:08:57.708Z)

So let me ask you this question, because Sherben, from the very beginning, set a safe note. Right. He's just like combining two things in his mind that I want to safe note. But for my safe note, I want to understand what the valuation is in the company. Does this make sense?

### You (2025-09-11T15:09:14.189Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:09:16.188Z)

So how do we deal with the situation like that?

### You (2025-09-11T15:09:21.709Z)

We may need to have a conversation that includes Drew and Mark. Right. With maybe the four of you.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:09:28.428Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T15:09:32.269Z)

And maybe get some information, do some research on exactly what a safe note is. Break it down into simple terms. But like I said, usually and Drew can do, I think, a pretty good job of explaining this, that there does have to be something in the safe. Note that it's going to be triggered by a valuation amount. But that valuation.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:10:00.508Z)

Which is typically series A in my understanding. You're right, it could be triggered by something else. But that's what I research is typically series A. And that's when then your precede converts to equity.

### You (2025-09-11T15:10:02.509Z)

Yeah. But you can't predict what that valuation is when you write the safe note. You don't know. You have no idea what the valuation is until you start raising equity. Essentially, what you would do is, and I want Drew to take this with the fact that I'm still not 100% on there, but the way he explained it is when we go to series A, we get a valuation of X dollars. When we get funding from that, we would pay back the safe notes. And in return, they would get their equity. But there again because it's like a loan. Right, so we have to get the lawyer.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:11:07.148Z)

It's alone. Right. But yeah, yeah, I would think the loan then though, just converts to equity because the money still, we can't pay them back. Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:11:16.509Z)

Maybe that's what Drew meant, that maybe we don't actually write a check back to them, but then.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:11:18.428Z)

Right. But then, but then their equity becomes whatever the entire precede equity. And let's just say for a minute that's $4 million, right? What? Everything. A research I have researched says that that total Berkadia called formil is essentially between 12 to 15% of the value of the company. Like, kind of like if there was a rule of thumb, right? Like you probably have rules of thumb and multifamily. Right? We have rules of thumb and hospitality as well. But that's one of the rules of thumb that I have read.

### You (2025-09-11T15:12:02.109Z)

Yeah. I'm not sure how that applies to safe notes, but what I'm thinking and I'm going to do some additional research myself, but I've been going down so many rabbit holes this week, I'm falling behind on some deliverables. To Vinod, so I probably won't do it until over the weekend. But the way I thought about this, as Drew was explaining it, is okay. Let's just say I write a check for $100,000. And six months from now. We get our first equity investor, or Series A, and our company, based on that Equity, is worth $1 million. So that $100,000 note would convert to 10%. If I get a 10 million valuation, that 100,000 now is just 1%. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:13:01.948Z)

Great. Dilute. Yes. The higher the valuation, the more diluted, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:13:06.829Z)

Yeah, I think that rule some of you're mentioning is for equity, not for safe investors. Because we can't control what percentage they own. The only thing that determines that is.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:13:18.028Z)

Unless to say converts to equity at a trigger point.

### You (2025-09-11T15:13:22.989Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:13:24.268Z)

Right? Then they become equity.

### You (2025-09-11T15:13:25.709Z)

Yeah. So that $100,000 check that I write today will convert to 10% equity. If I get a million dollar valuation. I get a 10 million dollar valuation, that becomes 1% equity.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:13:41.708Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:13:42.029Z)

So with a safe note, we can't say 10 to 12%. I think I'm pretty sure that the rule of thumb you're referring to would be maybe some pre seed equity or. Series a. Maybe early, I don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:14:00.508Z)

What I what I've read is that it's the total amount of your pre seed and that pre seed is usually around cult like 3 to 5 million dollars for company.

### You (2025-09-11T15:14:15.229Z)

That makes sense if we're talking the sum right. So I might write a check for 100,000. Somebody else might write a check for 200,000. So at a million dollars, there's 30% right there. And as that goes up. Right. Those will compress. So. Yeah, I can see where if you're talking about an average of your pre seed, Investments. That would probably fall within that 10 to 15% range. That makes sense to me.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:14:45.228Z)

And again, that's just what I. What I've researched. So I. To recap, I agree there's no valuation on a safe node. It's really a hope certificate. That is true. Right? But what I've read is that at a certain trigger, which is typically series A, and you go for series A When you're around 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 million in ARR, that's one point when like a fifth wall would look at us.

### You (2025-09-11T15:15:03.149Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:15:15.228Z)

And that's two, three years of work, essentially. So you need pre seed capital to cover that. Two to three years of work, which takes anywhere from three to five million dollars to fund. You raised that all with safe notes. In this precede ground. And then when you get to the point three years in the future, when we have $4 million,

### You (2025-09-11T15:15:34.509Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:15:42.108Z)

And we go to fifth Wall and say, hey, we're ready to really expand, right? Then those safe notes convert to equity at that point. And there has to be evaluation done.

### You (2025-09-11T15:15:53.949Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:15:54.908Z)

On. On the company. And then that becomes that. I mean, that. And I don't know if it becomes. I don't know if it's on the two and a half to three and a half. Million ARR. With future ARR. But again, I just go back to this, like, rule thumb I keep reading, which is, I mean, I pegged it down so close that it's like 12%, but it's between 10 and 15%. So I guess I have a problem though. Or maybe it's a good thing because this could just draw us to a I need to get driftwood are formed safe note by Monday morning. This should not be a hard thing to do because this is just a market safe note, right? I should be able to go into perplexity and say, write a market safe note. For a startup tech company. But there's a lot of tension right now. So what? How should we handle that?

### You (2025-09-11T15:16:57.229Z)

GRU sent a copy of the safe note that he signed.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:17:01.548Z)

He signed a promissory note, though. That's the difference.

### You (2025-09-11T15:17:06.029Z)

I think he may be two different I did not open the attachment, but in the body of his email he said here is the safe note that I sign, but it's different. He did mention specifically that there are clauses in there that we would not include in ours and we could just them. So you might start there. But I also think that, yeah, you can go online. You may not even need perplexity to write something. You can probably go online and find an existing template and take a look at that.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:17:10.108Z)

Okay? Okay? Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:17:41.709Z)

And then maybe just have Perplexity review it to see if there's anything. That needs to be updated or changed. But, yeah, I think they are. Fairly standard. So in the situation. If Mike puts in $50,000, that's a great check, but it's like a drop in the bucket, what we actually need.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:18:04.828Z)

I know. It's not worth 10% of the company. I know. I totally know that. Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:18:13.309Z)

But. The thing is, the thing that's good about him is that you guys are close. You're going to have conversations with him often, and if it appears that we're really getting traction and going up and he continues, if he really wants to continue to have a percentage, he just has to, you know, he'll have to reinvest just like any stock. If you want to buy a particular stock that's taken off, you keep buying it, you know, so that way he can maintain a certain percentage as we go along. But if he just writes one check for 50,000 and we end up getting, you know, a 25 million valuation, yeah, he would get.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:18:54.908Z)

I totally agree. You can't have that. So. But the thing I think about Sherbin, I mean. Well, one, we need the money, right? But again, I'm not agreeing to 10% valuation on the company. I don't want anyone to freak out about that because that's. That's not on the. Table.

### You (2025-09-11T15:18:55.709Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:19:12.748Z)

But it's that he's an attorney, and so we can tap into free legal resources. Right. Without essentially having to rack up huge third party.

### You (2025-09-11T15:19:24.509Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:19:25.308Z)

Legal resources, and he's a patent attorney, which I know you don't feel like what we're doing is patentable, but there may come a point where something that we're doing could be patentable, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:19:27.549Z)

Right. There. So here's another option. Is granting him equity unrelated to the safe note. So if we wanted to exchange services. It would have to be small, you know, 1 or 2%, right? He's gonna write our esop. Maybe we make him an employee and give him the same options that we would do an employee.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:20:11.548Z)

Could we do both? Could it be a safe investor and we give him 1 to 2%?

### You (2025-09-11T15:20:16.029Z)

I don't see why not.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:20:18.028Z)

Okay? Because I think that's what you might be looking for. Is that that might be the compromise he proposed something similar to that. That almost like a Jessica, right? Like he's. He sits in this like we're tapping into his resources to help grow our company, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:20:36.509Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So in my experience, An employee stock option is usually going to be. A very generous one is like two and a half to three percent. When you spread that out. And that would be for even. Even, like, your VP level. So, you know, if he were to get, like, a 3% cut, That would. That would be great. And I would. It would be a clear separation between Mike Sherman, the investor who has a safe note, and Mike Sherman.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:21:19.068Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T15:21:20.109Z)

Who is essentially an unpaid employee who will get paid via his equity.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:21:28.748Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:21:30.189Z)

Yeah, maybe. Maybe that says you can't do that. I don't know, but it makes sense to me.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:21:31.388Z)

No, I get that. The thing I research as well is most favorable nations. Cause I dealt with this at Hilton all the time. And that is, we have to be careful in our documentation because some investors will say, I want them your most favorable nation. Whatever you've given someone else, I want that deal, right? And so you've got to be careful how you draft things so that you don't have to give up the same whatever, early concessions you're giving up. Right? Like so, like, like with Carlos. Right? We're gonna separate consulting agreement versus the safe node. And no one will ever know that I've. Agreed. Give him X amount of time for this. They'll only know that Driftwood is our anchor precede investor and that's good for us, so.

### You (2025-09-11T15:22:20.189Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:22:25.948Z)

But was it really so just a posture? Was it in your mind? Was it really just about. The valuation. And that part of it is where. Where the conversation went south.

### You (2025-09-11T15:22:40.429Z)

That 's what I was hearing, because we are also talking about adding valuation in the pitch deck, which we. We can't do. Right. Exact same reason. We can't value it. We. We have nothing to value it on right now. It's just paper. So that's where.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:23:01.308Z)

Did you see that? Right. Do you see the connection where if we don't because we can't provide any information on valuation. To avoid a Sherbin like situation, we show investors that we think we're gonna need four million dollars or four and a half million dollars. Could it be right? Could be wrong. We're not. I mean, look, we're not, like. We're just trying to get within bounds, right? Say that for three years. We think we're gonna need $4 million. And the very first round is 500 to 550k. Then there'll be another one for 2 million and another one for 2 million. And then we think we'll be ready for Series A. But what I heard was Drew say no to that. And I don't even. I can't even remember what I heard Mark say. I mean, I just. I. By that point, I was so angry that I couldn't, like, see straight or hear straight.

### You (2025-09-11T15:23:58.189Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:23:59.148Z)

So what about. What do we do about that?

### You (2025-09-11T15:24:02.029Z)

I don't think Drew said no. And you're right, there's a lot of people talking over so same thing that five and a half million will hopefully be done via safe notes or precede. Right. And that's why I push back on that chart where he set has costs. We cannot allocate costs. To a budget like that. We just need a lump sum of money. So if I'm saying in order to create our POC, we need $125,000. In order to get it from our mvp. In order to get it from our mvp. To version one. That's gonna be another 75k, right? So in his graph, in the, in the MVP, right, we would put 125K. In the next one, we would probably be cumulative. So we'd show 200k to get there, because we need 125 for here, 75 there. So that cost just needs to be replaced with funds or some other term. Showing. This is what we need to get there. And we. We have a budget put together. But we do not put that in the deck. If somebody says, why? Then we. We discuss it. We verbally tell them, well, we've got this, this and this. Drew did make a good point, and this is always something that's been on my mind, is if we show salaries in. The chance that somebody's gonna push back and say, look, you know, I will give you money to cover the costs of construction, building, this marketing, go to market, blah, blah, blah, but I'm not going to pay your electric bill, right? Hardline. It could happen. So, you know, we may want to downplay the wholesaler thing as much as possible. Even if we show that, you know, we're accruing the salaries. And whether we actually pay them in the future is to be determined. We don't know. We'll see how things play out. That is something I did agree with that I hope we don't get in a situation like that, but somebody might want to get into the weeds like that. But for, for where we are today, and particularly in a pitch deck that we're going to show. We just show the cumulative amount of funds that we need to get to a particular place in time. And the pitch deck. I mean, we might show like, he has it right now. He's got POC MVP version one. He's got three columns. We may need to add a couple more Year one, year three through five. And that's where we get to, you know, the big money that you've got budgeted for, you know, the 5.5 mil or whatever. But we're not. We can't show a line item budget. In a pitch deck like that, so.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:27:31.948Z)

So this guy right here, because this is. I did a lot of research on this. Can you see this? What it said? The research. I. What the research told me was you have to have a slide in here that tells where their money is gonna go. Like, they need to understand what they're getting. They said keep it as general as possible, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:27:55.949Z)

Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:27:56.748Z)

So that is what I try to do. Because by saying four and a half million, what I'm trying to do is Sherben may think there's no way in, like, in my mind. If a lease AI can get to whatever they're at, and if, well, Active is a better direct example, they can get to 85 million and recurring ARR. Right. That's a lot.

### You (2025-09-11T15:28:26.749Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:28:26.988Z)

We can do that.

### You (2025-09-11T15:28:27.709Z)

Yeah.

And so that's where Sherman, like, Sherman's, like, oh, I run a one man esop shop, right? So to him, that's unfathomable. But that's why people recommend putting the total amount of pre seed capital that you need. In your pitch deck because it does while. While you're not committing to evaluation. It is mentally setting someone's, you know, like, view of how big the opportunity is. And then what I tried to say was that it's we're gonna be lean. It's gonna be an engineering team. And that like these co founders, we are working essentially jobs, right, that would have had to have been paid, that we would have had to bring resources in for, but we're working. And that we're also really gonna be looking at a build by partner strategy for each of our components as we grow. So you can see I've got phase one, I have phase two, and I have phase three, and I have it essentially going for, I guess it's two years. But we've been already. We've already been working for a year for free, pretty much. So this is like, I want to go back to the beginning because where I got so frustrated. Is we needed this months ago, right? And I have poured myself over this. I have redone this. Probably 10 times myself as I studied it. As the language has started to change, right? Earlier on, I was really following all that deal path language and the pair review language. But I can see on LinkedIn that it's changing. And the guy that runs Juniper Square, one of the most recent posts he put on was he had 40 some advisor CEOs in his office, right. That are his clients and the number one concern they had is AI and how they use AI.

### You (2025-09-11T15:30:37.309Z)

Y.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:30:37.868Z)

So I feel after listening to this for a couple of months that we need to change our problem to be. That's what's the problem is there's this big, scary thing out there that we know has value to us. That we know has value to everybody, but we're really not sure how to implement it. And it's really hard as just being one person without a technical background to truly understand it.

### You (2025-09-11T15:31:06.829Z)

Eah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:31:08.268Z)

So trust us. And I think I even said this in here somewhere. Is it? So navigating AI is hard to. Let's do this together, right? We're going to be your partner. We're going to do the research and understand it and bring it to the hotel industry. So let me just though go back to it. So I poured myself into the stack. It's not perfect. It could be way too wordy. That's what Drew thinks. I sit on the other side of that because I truly don't understand. If we don't have enough meat in this, how after we leave, then someone doesn't have material. But I'll roll with that. Right. They want to condense it more, but when they put that word document up, And they started to go through it. It felt to me like they threw out all the work that I had done and we were over. With. And I thought the three of us had agreed that we were going to change. We see the promise of AI but how do you understand something that's so complex, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:32:19.309Z)

Problem. To.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:32:26.908Z)

And then Mark goes back to Excel. I realized that's because he meeting and all the people we're talking. But you have to with this platform is going to be the AVM is the first module, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:32:32.189Z)

The. Posture.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:32:49.708Z)

There are going to be other modules. Just like rediq never got to the point where you were adding on additional modules. Where you were adding on an asset management module. Right where you were adding on the other modules. To me. I think you played down the Excel part and say our view is this. And then secondly, I do have a clear idea in my mind on how, when we get to complex full service hotels, How we sit down with certain key people in the industry. Do a collaboration and come up with the best in class and how to break down very complicated revenue data to underwrite it to the best. Right? I really do believe this. So why I blew up. Was because we need this done now, right? I'm the one fundraising Mark hasn't lifted a finger to fundraise. And we need the 500k in the next couple of months. We can't continue to retrench on this deck. We need it done.

### You (2025-09-11T15:34:05.549Z)

We can't continue.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:34:13.468Z)

And then the third thing is what they were showing. I was having a mini heart attack because I'm not proud of that. Does that make sense? Like I can't show that to Glenn Appeal. I didn't think it was very good. And so I have, like, I have a lot of responsibility.

### You (2025-09-11T15:34:33.069Z)

Responsibility.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:34:34.668Z)

With the women's network that I have access to and the few men that I have access to. To deliver a very good investor pitch deck. And what they were putting on the screen, I would be embarrassed to put in front of Glenn appeal. And so I was having a heart attack. I don't know how to manage. I don't know how to manage this. I thought in my brain at that moment, if I could push them to get a final product by next Tuesday, Knowing that we're gonna have to probably. I don't know. I mean, I don't know how to get through it after they do it. I just take the worst of it and try to recommend things to make better. And then. Or that we have two decks. One, this becomes a consumer deck that Mark can use. And the other is an investor pitch deck. But Howard scared.

### You (2025-09-11T15:35:26.829Z)

I actually thought that's what we were doing. Because they are. Too totally different audiences. You can't show a pitch deck to a prospective client, and you can't show a client deck to prospective investor. They have to be separate. Second thing is, if I were in your position, I would put it in writing. As an email to kind of hold, you know, avoid all this thing, at least, you know, the things that you object to. But yeah, I think first we need to decide who is the audience for these decks, if they're working on one to show respective clients. Let them go. You know, we do have to. One of the things that I have always found difficulty with is control. You know, I never thought that I was a control freak. But of course, if you are control freak, you don't think you are.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:36:36.988Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:36:37.309Z)

And the hardest thing that I learned is to let other people do their job. And I still find myself stepping in where I probably shouldn't. So I think because Mark will be. I mean, he'll be working with investors. And of course, Drew will kind of straddle the line. But if what they're working on now is more of a client facing Deck, let him go. Just. Just let him do.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:37:14.428Z)

I agree. I agree that. I agree that I'm not worried because the clients are the Habro community. Right? And so if Mark puts his deck in Hebrew language that he thinks his Hebrew buds will understand, That's fine. Right. But we have to raise this money. And I know Mark literally. What's the word I'm looking for? He always says I can't let my own personal circumstances dictate this. But I have immense frustration with him because I thought he was going to be bringing in potential investors. When we talked in January or February, he played up that he knew all these people and he should have had Dan Lesser, in my opinion, in here two months ago.

### You (2025-09-11T15:37:57.869Z)

Something.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:38:16.748Z)

But I need a deck that I can feel proud of because I am the one. I feel like now I am the one that needs to go talk to people about giving us money. And I cannot go with a deck that leads with an Excel problem when the world has changed so much. Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:38:39.789Z)

I would fully support having two decks. And I think you should just keep going with what you've got going because you are focusing more on fundraising right now. And if they want to do the client facing and, you know, even, even, like, with lesser or anybody who could potentially be both a client and an investor. Right. You've already accomplished that with your contacts, but I don't see any reason why. Why we can't have two. I'm 100% aligned with what you said. You know the voice. If you had to sit down and present their deck, The way that they've got it. Like you said, the hey, bro, and it's not your. You would be uncomfortable. Know you're uncomfortable. You could see it and Howard. And they're going to be the same way if they try to take your deck and show it to a customer. They probably would feel the same way. I don't see any conflict between the two, you know?

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:39:48.348Z)

And that's what they feel, right? That's where Mark says that it really should be almost like the same deck, but just with certain slides that get removed and inserted because we're going to friends and family in the hotel industry. For the money.

### You (2025-09-11T15:40:07.309Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:40:08.268Z)

And that's true. And hey, we could give Dan lost her both decks, right? We could give Dan lost this deck and Mark Stack and maybe that's fine, but.

### You (2025-09-11T15:40:22.509Z)

Yeah, I was going to say there's probably going to be some that. Something in their deck that you think, oh, yeah, that probably should be in mine, and vice versa. They.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:40:33.948Z)

Yeah. They won't like the idea of two ducks. Well, but maybe I shouldn't say that.

### You (2025-09-11T15:40:41.309Z)

I know, but we. We have to have. And I'd be more than happy to jump in.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:40:47.468Z)

Yes. Today, when we talk about that, if you could and just say that.

### You (2025-09-11T15:40:51.309Z)

We've got different audiences. A customer is totally different than an investor. You're not going to find a one size fits all.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:41:00.748Z)

Right? Because a customer will be thinking about Excel, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:41:03.869Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:41:05.548Z)

But on the investor side, what I'm trying to show is that this is like a monumental shift in that we'll never, ever see in our careers again, right? That creates an opportunity that could. Because, like you say, we're this niche industry that's overlooked, but we're deep. We're connected because of brands. And our ability to scale international is unique because of those brands and the network effect. Right. So that's what I'm trying to tell investors. But a customer could care less about that. They only want their problem solved.

### You (2025-09-11T15:41:45.789Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:41:46.508Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:41:46.829Z)

Yeah. So, like I'm seeing on the screen right now, you've got the problem. You know, I do think Excel needs to be mentioned, but not the focus. You know, and how we phrase it, you know, it could be just a technology issue. But, you know, I think the important thing to point out is that. Excel is an island. It doesn't have all these external connections to all this other data, whereas we would have the ability to integrate all of this data.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:42:29.148Z)

See. But I do have Excel here. I just look clean connected data because I knew Mark would be like. Folks. So most hotel data remains trapped and fragmented. Spreadsheets and outdated systems.

### You (2025-09-11T15:42:30.909Z)

Okay? There you go. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:42:43.868Z)

Excel is where data goes to die. I put that in specifically because Mark likes to say it that way. So do you see how hard I tried? I listened to everything he says, and I'm like, how do I get this? Weave this in so he's happy. And then. And please. It's just because you're my monstros colleague, and I don't want Beno to feel this frustration or Drew to feel this frustration. But then Mark sends an email saying, I've spent all of Sunday afternoon working on this, right? My heart beat started to go up. What was so like, okay all of Sunday afternoon? Boy, you must have been busy rewriting what I wrote. So I'm gonna have to take a calm breath on Tuesday when we go through it. And then on Tuesday, they put up a Word document. That is. I can't even tell you, like, a thousand steps back from where. This is when we need to have a deck done by Labor Day, and it's past Labor Day.

### You (2025-09-11T15:43:49.309Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:43:51.868Z)

So, howard, how do I do this? Because. I don't. Maybe I'm the one with the control issue, right? But Mark and I are not connecting on this, and I don't know how to truly connect with him. At this point because my emotions are pretty high. And he has some. Sometimes he has tendencies. He's to be like, know it all. I know better than you do. Advice is the third party, calm person who could. Because this is natural. It's natural for teams to have disagreements. It's good even.

### You (2025-09-11T15:44:34.829Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:44:36.988Z)

So we proposed two decks, right? That's what the.

### You (2025-09-11T15:44:39.629Z)

I would say that. And it. It might. Be. I don't know that I would bring it up in our call today, but Carrie could be the key to this. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:44:50.668Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T15:44:55.549Z)

Maybe. I did have a call with Mark and Carrie yesterday. Just an introduction call.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:45:01.468Z)

Oh, that's good.

### You (2025-09-11T15:45:02.429Z)

They got along really well. Carrie blew me away with all of her questions that she had for Mark, she was very well prepared. Brought up all these suggestions and clearly, like, well, do you need business cards to hand out at this conference in Phoenix? Just all these different things. So I. I think you know right away. Because of that connection, I think Mark would probably listen to her as well. So I almost think that Lep Mark and Drew go with theirs.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:45:36.028Z)

Yes, that's a great idea.

### You (2025-09-11T15:45:42.269Z)

You use yours? And then we can use carry at some point, maybe to merge them. Right. Let her use her marketing expertise. But I still think. I don't think we will ever get away from having different presentations for different Personas. Right. When we have an actual sales team. They would do that. They would. They don't care about the investor deck. They would take all theirs. They may even make a separate deck for lenders versus brokers and may have three or four different versions, right?

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:46:19.548Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T15:46:22.269Z)

So we have to be prepared for that. I really do feel that what Mark and Drew aren't working. I know it's in a Word document now, but it would be converted into a presentation deck, so I'm not worried about the fact that it's a word, but I thought what they had in the deck was pretty good. With the exception of that visual that I mentioned, that we have to change that. And I don't think we got through the whole thing. But, you know, I just. I will be more than happy to jump on that point in the call today.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:47:04.668Z)

I mean, let me go down to. For a second. I just show you because, like, this is why I didn't think what they presented was good. Is this is a very ugly slide. So please, and I swear by said that and my email when I sent this on Sunday. But what I'm trying to show is here on the right. Is what is really what's valuable, right? Which is? You always say that the workflows are great, but it's the data that's the gold mine. So it's the specialized hotel investment, and we've agreed to call it a data model. I thought that's the terminology the five of us agreed on. I would have used the word LLM prior. But that conversation we had a couple weeks ago really helped me to understand and the transaction we become the transaction marketplace.

### You (2025-09-11T15:47:58.109Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:47:58.748Z)

Where we are getting paid off of the Aum somehow. And so we do. The first is the pipeline management and underwriting. And then we'll see this interactive OM this afternoon. But when you see it, you'll I guarantee you'll either want to go with this group or you'll see it and be so impressed, you'll be like, oh, we need to do something like this ourselves, but do we have the actual bandwidth to do it quickly? Right? We're gonna do debt and structured finance and appraisals where we're start our deployment, right, because it's on the higher end. Then we do our full service release, which helps the people that are the Excel, the ones that hold Excel, so close that we start to try to get them to, like, say, oh, I really love how they built this revenue module. It's. It's so close to how I do it in my own right. And we even get their advice when we're doing it. Then this. This is why I put this one in. Is Mark's feedback. That from the HLA was the management community that showed the most interest. So this is like, this is like for the management company, right? This is like their tool that they will use, which will be different. It's gonna be much more granular, right? We debt and structured finance and appraiser. High, high, high level manager. Very granular, detailed. And the issue that our industry has.

### You (2025-09-11T15:49:22.909Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:49:34.588Z)

Multifamily may have it as well. Is the underwriting goes into, like, an Excel spreadsheet that gets locked and finalized. The wall comes down between acquisitions and asset management, right? And there's no roadmap that shows you. Okay, now, I'm gonna go from underwriting now to actual, when in reality, our industry has the data to build to, like, be able to roadmap that, right? So. And then let me just keep going. Legal work flow. PIP workflow. Right. This is the loan servicing piece, which I truly believe we need to go after at some point, because this is. It's so basic. We price it affordably, especially if we're going after lenders. This becomes the bare minimum. Keep your lights on, Revenue. Right? It's. It's consistent. It doesn't change. Every loan has to be serviced, right? It's not volume transaction volume based which kills brokers. Right. We do the investment management module, which is more like the return. Right. The returns. Right. Like a pair of you. Then we start to work on the closing. This is. This is very near and dear to my heart because this is how I think you sell it to operators. Is they spend days preparing for owner presentations. Right? So create a module that helps them not have to prepare at all, because it's. They just. It's there. Right. And they don't have to actually create a doc. The ESG collaboration is specifically put in there because of my attempt to try to. Create a collab with mind click and mine clip is they track ESG and renovations. But also, ESG will be. I mean, like, you've got measurable out there, right, that we could have an API integration with or an agentic relationship with. There's a. There's a group called Squeak that is doing really, really great work. On rating hotels and their carbon footprint, which I think is going to be become more important than the fund administration. I call it a collab because I don't think we ever want to become a juniper square, right, or an appfolio, but we will. This is the goal is to connect with them. Education and training. This becomes like, okay, how do you teach these young kids? Who think they're, like, brilliant, but really don't know anything about hotels. It's a problem. Like, I sat in that chair myself, right? And I thought I knew so much about hotels when I was a young acquisition analyst. And then I crossed over into asset management, and I saw what's under the hood. And it's like, oh, my God, these kids know nothing. Right? And we're valuing 50 million, you know, dollar hotels. So how do we that. How do we teach senior people or people in the industry about AI and hospitality? How do we bring content creation and education to this very niche industry? And I have some other ideas too. But how we might affiliate with one particular conference. To almost do like a cretek, kind of like a teeny tiny, like, add on, like, retech. Because cretek, the way they do the breakouts in the video s is great. I mean, it's there. You can go in and review it after. So if people don't want to sit in a room, when they could be networking at a conference. You can still go to Pretec and sign in and see all the content around the breakout sessions. And it's just really changed my mind about how a conference can monetize.

### You (2025-09-11T15:53:36.989Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:53:44.348Z)

I think we could make money on this identifier idea. Right. This might also be a way to have keep your lights on revenue, because it would be consistent potentially. And then this is the very last thing I put right, because this is like. This is where you say, we're not gonna chase shiny things, right? Like this. But. But at some point, the video and voice is gonna. That unstructured data is gonna become very, very important. And when you put all of this together, Then on this side, you end up, within five years, this fantastic data model that we have so much information in. And we become a transaction. Marketplace. So it's like this is the vision. But this is an ugly slide, and I mentioned that to everyone. And now I just wanna go flip through a couple more things. But I wanna go to what for you. Just. Well, let me. Yeah, let me. Okay. Pricing strategy. And this is. Again, this is ugly. Right? But I was just trying to get the content down. I went back and read what you wrote about the pricing strategy and that it would be on the higher side of SaaS based pricing. So that's what I said initially. High end of SaaS pricing, right? Hotels are complex. And we think we can show the ROI to our beta customers. So I haven't committed to anything in price. No numbers on this page, just the concept. That we will start out with SaaS based pricing. Then very quickly, we go to the T shirt pricing, right? Smaller organizations, media organizations, large organizations. I pray to God we land some big organizations. As beta or maybe V1. That could get us to 2 and a half to 3 and a half million in ARR. Like do so much transaction volume, right? And then this was intended to say that now, as AI Gets added more and more into it, we're sitting here, we don't even know at this point what that's going to do, but it will do something and it will increase pricing. And then the last is to become a transaction market. Where we're pricing on Aum. Here. This was directly from you. Your email, I think. In fact, I took what you wrote. And I asked AI to summarize it for me for a dac.

### You (2025-09-11T15:56:32.029Z)

No, this is.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:56:32.828Z)

So I focus innovation, not hype, right?

### You (2025-09-11T15:56:37.069Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:56:38.028Z)

So these were. This was exactly what you said to me, just summarized in a bullet point. Format. This next slide because I feel like we need a couple of slides about AI in here. This is the leaf. That we talked about, remember? And it was too complicated to see and read all of that, but essentially, this is the leaf. One of the leaves was LLM. One of the leaves was rag. One of them was AI agent. One of them was a gentic AI and so I might not have this when we might want to show this a different way and put. And I think we need to put some real words in here that people can understand. But we sit at the intersection of this, right? And we're going to serve our clients that sit out here something. This is the concept. And this is what I thought Mark and Drew would do is look at something like this and say, oh, okay. Well, we should really do a show. There's no customer engagement on this slide, so we should maybe put some of that in here. And then let me go back to the Tam.

### You (2025-09-11T15:57:46.429Z)

Let me make a comment real quick as I'm sitting here watching it, as I would like a like a client on that leaf graph, can I suggest that you do the opposite? Make the investai small to you and make the other ones larger. And we could put something in there like for example, people aren't going to know the difference between an AI Agent and agent, right?

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:58:01.228Z)

Yes. Right. Yes. That's what. Right. So we need language for that, right? Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T15:58:14.749Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So that way, within the AI agent circle, you could put automated workflow.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:58:23.068Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-11T15:58:23.229Z)

That's what it is. And then agentic AI would be used for deep research and that. Right. So you wouldn't have space to do it this way.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:58:28.108Z)

Yes. Yes.

### You (2025-09-11T15:58:33.309Z)

You know, maybe we want to try a different design, but. Yeah, I would make investai the small connector to the four larger areas.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:58:42.828Z)

Right. So how are this discussion that we're having right now was the discussion I thought we were going to have on Tuesday, right? And that's all fantastic feedback. I mean, I totally agree. I just don't know what words to put in there. And then I'm not. I'm not a Carrie, right? Like, I. Like, I fumble and PowerPoint. It's not something that comes naturally to me. Right. I'm so much a. Like an Excel. Well, I guess. God, I live my life in email, I feel like. But. And then I'm just gonna go back to the TAM because.

### You (2025-09-11T15:59:15.389Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T15:59:17.708Z)

This is the last thing right? I took your advice. I read through that article that you shared with me that said, Remove this slide. Just remove it. It's a stupid slide, right? People will. You're gonna lose credibility if you try to explain how big the market is. But I did think that everyone understands and concept that commercial real estate is a huge driver of the economy. Right. And so just by saying that hotel deals volume. Makes up 6 to 7% of the US commercial real estate industry. I thought that was good enough. It's like this show, like, oh, this is pretty big, right? This is a big opportunity. And then the words on the right side of the page. Are very important. Like the network effect. That is a word I have heard. Like Manny at Driftwood uses that word to describe something that can multiply quickly from, like, a workflow and revenue perspective, right? The niche opportunity. Right. We've talked about that. And that I tried to just put in here this feeling that I have. No one's coming to save us in the hotel industry. You know, you can have. Great. Mark found that. I guess that's the other thing that just. I almost flipped out when Mark was trying to use that company. And that's great that they're doing that, but he doesn't even understand that they're really a competitor to Drew, right? And, like, they're not going to come save us in the hotel industry. We are a freaking complicated sector. And so the fact that we had the idea to bring you and Vinod together with us sets us apart. Right. So that's what I was trying to say is, like, that. The network impact and then that the branding piece of it is so unique and it represents a big opportunity. So it's not really a campaign, right? Like you would normally see. But I hope I tried to show people why this could be very big.

### You (2025-09-11T16:01:30.349Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:01:32.428Z)

So I didn't think this was like, would I give it. I'd give it a what? A B minus. An attempt. Right. But when Mark said he spent all of Sunday afternoon working on this, Go back to my heart. Starts to be like, what does that mean? Because we needed this done by Labor Day. And then when they put that on the screen, And I agree. Word can get translated into that pop AI right? And it looks amazing. Probably. I have it somewhere. Drew's colors and everything like that. But it was so hard to get the idea into these little bite sized comments. Right? And then when I saw Mark just couldn't let go of the Excel piece, when I had it, it was there. Right? Right. So. Oh, my God. Okay, I'm talking too much.

### You (2025-09-11T16:02:24.429Z)

Yeah, yeah. No, no. This is very helpful. I am actually pretty good in PowerPoint. If you would like me to help clean it up.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:02:41.708Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-11T16:02:42.109Z)

I can. I can do that. But.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:02:44.588Z)

Look at it. If you want to change the words, change the words, too. I mean, I just. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-09-11T16:02:48.829Z)

Yeah. I mean, if there's something that I see that's wrong, sure, I'll.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:02:54.748Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:02:54.989Z)

But. No but instead of don't, don't just send me the deck. If you want to, just go ahead and click on the share button and just share it with me. That way. We're working on the same file.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:03:06.908Z)

Oh, got it. You mean you put it. Put it into the team site, right?

### You (2025-09-11T16:03:11.949Z)

I don't. I don't know if you even need to be in the team site. I think you can share this, even though. Yeah. If you click on that share button, let's see what happens.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:03:19.708Z)

Now. Okay, hold on. Let me go back to that.

### You (2025-09-11T16:03:25.709Z)

It's right at the. The top right of the screen.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:03:27.868Z)

Yeah. I have to maximize you. Maximize you by doing maximize the meeting window. Okay, so should I see the sharing? And I say it says, stop sharing. Where do I share it?

### You (2025-09-11T16:03:45.309Z)

It looks like your cursor is in the editing box. Is that where you are? Yeah. Up at the top, right, the orange button. That says share.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:03:58.188Z)

I had it. Where'd it go? Oh, here. Chat layout, optimize, give control.

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:05.309Z)

The far right of the screen.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:09.228Z)

Right this.

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:09.869Z)

That right there? Yep. The share.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:11.548Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:13.629Z)

So no, you'd want to share the whole thing, so just click the top. Share.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:14.188Z)

Link to slide. Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:22.109Z)

Oh, yeah. You have to have it in your updrive. Okay, so why don't you just. Yeah, instead of doing that, just go ahead and upload it into the team site.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:30.508Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:32.749Z)

And just let me know where you put it if you want to put it in the. Startup folder or something like that. You just have to remember that, you know, that's. That's the version that we would have to work on.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:48.508Z)

Yeah y.

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:49.309Z)

All right. One more thing on the budget, the very first screen that we were on,

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:56.108Z)

Eah, let me go back to it.

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:57.069Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:04:58.988Z)

Can you still see it?

### You (2025-09-11T16:04:59.229Z)

The time, the timeline wasn't.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:02.988Z)

You don't think the timeline's right? Okay.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:04.349Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:06.988Z)

Why would I get that? Come out of here.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:08.829Z)

There you go.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:10.668Z)

Okay, so this guy.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:11.789Z)

Yeah. All right, so phase one. September of October. That's actually. We. We need to talk in quarters and not months. So if you want to put it well, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:23.388Z)

Okay? 4q no.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:31.709Z)

I would say q3. Of 2025 through Q1. So that's basically because. Because actually, technically, I started working on this back in April, right?

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:45.708Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:45.949Z)

But we don't need to say it's going to take an entire 12 months. Yeah. And then Q1 of 25, so that takes us through March.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:05:57.468Z)

Yep. Okay.

### You (2025-09-11T16:05:58.109Z)

And then same thing there. Now, there's another thing too, because there it's showing. March And April of 2026, we jump from needing 550. To 1,000 to 2.5 million. And like, we're not going to two and a half million in March, but this one, I would say let's, let's go through the rest of 20, 20, 26. So I would say Q2, Q4. Of 2026. Yeah. And. And on the top one, I see that you've got Q1 of 2025. We need to change that to 2026. Right, and then the bottom one there, phase three. Then you've got basically the right timeline. January, February. I would just change That1 to Q1, 2027. So this way.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:06:57.788Z)

Yeah, I guess that's what I did mean is it was 20, 28. Then is when we go out for. Because in my mind, it was three years. Because it's like, we need this. Two like, we need this. To scale, right? And then over three years. And hey, if we want to put this in a different. I made this up, right? I mean, the 550 I feel like is real, but the two and a half, that's just research I've done. As far that seems to make sense. As far as how much I think we're gonna need.

### You (2025-09-11T16:07:13.149Z)

Yeah. Yeah, no, that sounds good. So at least that way we've got a solid timeline. It didn't jump. That that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:07:40.028Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T16:07:43.149Z)

So let me know. When you've uploaded this to the team site and and I will go through it now in our chat on teams. I copied and pasted a couple things that I had in that email. I think. You mentioned about the AI and the shiny new object. There's a couple things in there. That in the chat that I think it would be important to investors, not, not customers, but let them know. I mean, you don't have to copy this word for word, but we want to let them know that we're just not throwing any AI into it, that we're always going to answer the question how can AI make this either better, faster, or easier and provide measurable value to our user's measurable keyword, right?

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:08:33.468Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-11T16:08:36.589Z)

So shiny objects don't provide value. They're just the. The cool factor, hype factor, if we want to make sure. And I do this because. There's still chatter in the media about that MIT study where 95%, well, they failed because they were chasing the shiny object. They weren't looking for measurable. The ones that 5%, they're the ones that I. Focusing on measurable value, not just, you know, a brand new chat bot. Big deal. So I. I think it's important in your deck to have something similar to that.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:08:59.388Z)

Es.

### You (2025-09-11T16:09:21.389Z)

Somewhere.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:09:22.268Z)

Are you okay? Just to add that, though. Are you okay? Just to add that because that's what I thought I was doing when I sent this out on Sunday afternoon is like, you would take your parts, right. Which is might be the AI and the pricing and where I had not fully captured something I thought were maybe I had not fully captured the right language. On the problem and the solution. And the elevator deck, that Mark would try to clean that up. Right, that the timelines would get cleaned up. I didn't think we'd start over from scratch.

### You (2025-09-11T16:09:56.189Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, when you get it, share up on the up on the teams site. That way we're working in the same version and we don't have to copy, paste or look at who did what. When you send out individual models, Mark might be making a change in the exact same paragraph that I made a change, and we don't know which is which. So, yes, I, I would be. More than happy to go through this while I'm cleaning it up to, you know, if there is something like that.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:10:11.948Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T16:10:30.269Z)

That we should add. We can do that. I did not do that because I. That's what I thought we were gonna do on Tuesday as well. But you know, these are both large decks. I mean, it would probably take up two hour call to go through. If we were to go through slide by slide. And get it done, but I don't know. I just keep going back to the fact that I think, let Mark and Drew be Mark and Drew. You and I can work on this one. There are two different audiences. And. And, you know, we. Have money. To. To pay, which I think we do. I mean, at $30 an hour.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:11:13.468Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:11:17.229Z)

You know, then we can bring in. You know, it's like raising children, right? It's like you can. You can tell them whatever you want, but until they hear it from somebody else,

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:11:23.468Z)

Yeah. I mean, need beauty to coach me through something else. And I honestly wish there. I've been thinking about if there's a few women I could reach out to to help me coach through this. This challenge that I'm having. So the dynamic between Mark and I is one that exists. Very it's very deeply ingrained in hotel investment. S. It's actually deeply ingrained in multifamily, too. I've seen. Sometimes I think it might even be worse in multifamily from, like, the time I spent at Waterton and just how deal guys see themselves and then how they see the rest of the world around them. I'm gonna use it an example for when I. When I was with Waterton, I worked in Asset. Management. I'd already made the shift from transactions over to asset management. I was on the hotel side. We were growing a hotel sponsor platform. But David had already grown the multifamily into, like, really successful fun series. Right. And that's what we thought we were gonna grow Hotel into. And I was talking to a younger analyst that was on my team. And we were talking about, I don't know, about investments or something like that. And he said, well, a woman could never be a transaction person. Because she could never go to dinner with brokers. Like, she couldn't do that. Like she wouldn't be able to do that, right? And I was shocked. I was literally just so thrown back. But the multifamily transaction guys that sat across from me was really bad behavior in office, right? It was like, kind of, I don't know. It wasn't necessarily directed toward me. It wasn't directed toward me at all, but it was still. Unacceptable behavior for a workplace. So let me go back to this shoe that I think I'm having with Mark. Is that Mark early on? He wanted to talk to me almost daily. To let me know that he has been through this before and he wants to coach me. On how to handle the team. Because the technology people can get out of hand, and it takes a firm leader. To keep the boat. Afloat or sailing or moving ahead or what? I mean, whatever analogy you want to use. So Mark does not like my style. This just makes sense, right? Like, in his mind. And I think this is a gender thing. And the gender thing is in that there's still a few women and leadership. Right. And Mark was a former broker and a deal guy. And I tried to do some research on this over the weekend. That's exactly why I went to him, so that he could face that hey, bro community and be a hey, bro. Right. And we would have success. Versus me trying to do that. But I feel like what's happening is it's getting turned around internally to me. And so there was a day about six months ago where Mark and. I mean, we just kind of got into it. And I wanted him to know he can't boss me around like that. Right. Like we're partners. Right. But we can't have these daily calls where you criticize me every single way of. How I'm doing this. And that stopped our day to day calls. But I think now with this happened, is he's enlisted Drew in that effort. And Drew's not like that. She's not a Hebrew, and she's very organized. And I am like, praise be, if there's someone way more organized than I am. To do the things that we should all play to our best skills, right? But I don't know how to handle Mark the right way. Is this making sense?

### You (2025-09-11T16:15:39.629Z)

Makes perfect sense.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:15:41.148Z)

Because I feel like I don't know how to. I just don't know how to handle Mark. This is the right way. I cannot be on daily calls with him where he's completely criticizing everything. I don't think that's effective. It will definitely kill my spirit. We don't talk daily, right? We talk a couple times a week and we communicate well and we keep things going. So what do I. What do I do in this situation? You've probably been around people like this too, right? Multifamily brokers. Are. I mean, there's some of the worst.

### You (2025-09-11T16:16:24.509Z)

Yeah, yeah. But I haven't been around them in this similar situation is what you described. Which is. Which is interesting because I can't speak to the brokerage community. But I can speak to, you know, multifamily owners. Operators where on that side of the business, women have made tremendous progress. I've had many women supervisors. So I don't know, on the business side or the operations side. You know, there's. I don't see a whole lot of that. Some people. I mean, sometimes it's a cultural thing, like at one that you described, you know, could be part of the culture that they've kind of ingrained. It could be just the person.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:17:27.948Z)

It was a person. There was a particular person that was just like. And they knew it. And eventually they solved it honestly by he laughed and culture got a lot better. But I will just always remember that just like my shock to his comment, right like that. I couldn't have dinner with a broker, but it comes back to that. It's not quite that I use that as a story, but Mark and I are having this similar. Right. Dynamic where he puts. And he has been through this once. Right. But yet at the same time. In the eight months I've known him in this capacity, he hasn't done a lot. Like he has not done what I thought he would do. And I'm struggling with how to, like, how to motivate him. How to get it so that the five of us are working really well together. I value what he brings because it will help us grow this company. I just have to figure out how I manage the personality dynamic and be the best. Collaborator and weaver of personalities that I can be.

### You (2025-09-11T16:18:44.749Z)

So. I. Think. What might help. Is to have a very candid conversation about roles. Even. Maybe even introducing a job description. I don't want it, though, to be construed as a stay in your lane. Type of thing, because, of course, everybody's gonna have. Input on other items. But, for example, it's not your job to make sure that the technology team is in line. Because he is absolutely right that the engineers like to engineer. And they may have their own opinion of how something should look or how it should work. Or some fancy new product is designed and they want to copy it. Yes, they will do that. But it's not the CEO's job. It's not your job to do. That's my job. If Mark is going to be our chief.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:20:18.828Z)

Commercial officer.

### You (2025-09-11T16:20:19.869Z)

Yeah, whatever. Which is basically the fundraiser.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:20:23.228Z)

Sales. Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:20:25.789Z)

He needs to focus on fundraising. And I don't want to say state or say stay in your lane, but it's kind of like, this is what we. This is what we need to do. Focus on your own skill set, and let's work together as a team to do what the team needs to accomplish. I don't know how he would take something like that. I don't know him that well.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:20:56.348Z)

I think that all works until it gets to how he and I divide up.

### You (2025-09-11T16:21:00.909Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:21:01.868Z)

Our world because it's so intertwined.

### You (2025-09-11T16:21:04.189Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:21:05.308Z)

It's just like this crazy small, little clicky group of people, right? That we both know. For the most part, we both know the same people in the organizations. His are more senior than mine, which makes it really frustrating to me when I say, oh, I talk to Stacey Naldoni, and he's like, oh, I know the leader of this company. And it's like, well, why don't you just start to have some of these conversations, right? We don't have to deliver the product today. Just say that I'm reaching out to you because in a few months, we're going to be delivering this or that. So that's what. So when it comes to he and I, I don't know how we truly break out our job description from one another. We have to work very collaboratively together.

### You (2025-09-11T16:21:52.189Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:21:54.668Z)

And which is why when he says we need to be on the same page, I agree. My problem is that he needs to, like, step up. And he should have been on the page that we're all on four or five months ago. We're all trying to pull him up so he understands. Right. And does that make sense? So that even understands what the product is?

### You (2025-09-11T16:22:16.429Z)

I absolutely agree. I've said many times that how disappointed I am that he's not willing to speak to somebody. Until we have everything in.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:22:27.148Z)

A perfect product, right?

### You (2025-09-11T16:22:30.669Z)

He needs to know we will never have 100% of a product done because there's always something. It's continuous.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:22:38.108Z)

Exactly. For the next 10 to 50 or 5 to 15 years. I mean, we won't even be here when, you know, it's still continuing on.

### You (2025-09-11T16:22:49.309Z)

So. Yeah, I've always been frustrated with that. That. Yeah. I think he should have been knocking on doors and selling the dream, like he said a couple days ago, a long time ago.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:23:02.428Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:23:03.309Z)

But he's not really selling the drain. He's waiting to sell the product. And we won't get to that. Point without money. The node and I were talking about this exact same thing. It's like, okay, we're here at the very beginning of the process. We need to get here. For an mvp and a version one. The way from here to here is money. Money is the bridge. If you're gonna wait until version one before you get any money, you're never gonna get there. We're dead. Let's just fork it. Right. I know Benoit's on board. I don't think Mark is not on board. I just think he's got the wrong perspective. It's like I mentioned before. I don't know what his experience was with whatever before, if he got burned.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:24:17.868Z)

He was somehow burdened. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T16:24:19.229Z)

But the bottom line is you can't base an entire philosophy on one bad experience. You can't say, well, I lost money on this, therefore I'm not gonna do this. Right. So I don't know how or if we'll ever get to the point where he's comfortable. I think when Vinod gave his presentation and he saw what was already done. I think we can convince him to start knocking on doors. Way before version one. And I will continue to point out the fact that we will never get to that point without money. And if he's not willing to do the friends and family route, if he's waiting. To do the institutional route. Then he needs to just step back. And let you continue your conversations because you've already uncovered three potential investors, right? He doesn't want anything to the table if he's waiting to get the big bucks, the equity money. Then.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:25:31.468Z)

I think he's waiting for his friends and he doesn't want to be embarrassed. Does that make sense? Like he doesn't? Yeah. He wants to take Dan something that is perfect like that in his. In his mind. Not perfect, but perfect for an mvp, right? And it's just not going to be perfect. Someone gave me the advice. Mark was actually on this call. Too. It was this ERP company that services hotel management companies, and they said, If a year from now, you look back at your POC or your mvp, whatever. I mean, I was. We were talking POC at this time. And they said, and you are not horribly embarrassed by what you put together? Then you spent too much time on it. Right. And that sticks with me so much, like. Okay, so, yeah, we're gonna be a little embarrassed about this. Sure. It feels good to us now, but. Yeah. Anyway, so I was. Maybe I need to reach out to some women and try to get their sense of how to handle a difficult. Not a difficult, but just.

### You (2025-09-11T16:26:42.989Z)

Yeah, I think that would probably. Yeah, they would be able to give you a lot better advice than I can.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:26:48.748Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T16:26:50.349Z)

And honestly. Most of those articles and the things that I share with everybody. I mean, I'll be honest. They're really kind of directed towards Mark. But I don't want out. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:27:03.628Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:27:04.909Z)

I don't know if he's been reading them or not.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:27:07.628Z)

I don't think he does the thing. I don't think he does, really, so.

### You (2025-09-11T16:27:10.989Z)

There's a couple times where he's just replied thanks or something like that. Where? Yeah, okay, maybe he did read that one, but 90% of them I never hear back anyway. But I know I've shared some articles pertaining to exactly what you just said. How do you release? It doesn't have to be perfect. You just have to have enough to show it's about the function. It's not about the colors in the logos. And I don't know if any of that sinks in or not.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:27:48.748Z)

Well, thank you for your patience. I mean, I'm not. You know, I'm, like, asking you these things. Probably I have a therapist to ask, but it's all said and done, so I can work through this. But I have to this mark and I somehow have to get on the same page. And our personalities are so different. And I kind of was hoping Drew could be a middleman, too, but I don't know if that's working out quite as. Our lawn dies here, slat outside, as I had originally hoped it would be, but.

### You (2025-09-11T16:28:23.469Z)

Well, how often do you talk to Drew?

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:28:28.828Z)

You're busy. You're running his own company, right? So Drew and I don't really have one on one conversations. I talk to him. When we're all talking together. Except for one. We talked last week for a while. And he. And he understands what it's like not to be able to, like, support your family and the stress that that brings with it. Right. And the need for fun.

### You (2025-09-11T16:28:55.389Z)

So I have had some conversations with Drew. He makes time so I subscribe to a calendar sharing tool. There's a lot of them out there. Calum Lee kl.com I use. You can book me this one that I had never heard before but then I read an article. On some new tools that had come out, and it had really good reviews, and I've been using it. I think it works really good. And all I did is. In fact, you'll see in my email signature, I've got a little link on the bottom says, book some time with me. That's what you can do. Just include Lincoln. But you have to keep your calendar up to date. But if you send that to him, he'll pick a time and call. Because I really think you need to have the same conversation with him that we're having right now. He is not the type to get upset or angry. Like Mark did. And he does talk to Mark because when we do talk, he said, yeah, Mark and I were on a call, or Mark and Diane and I were on a call, and he is working with Mark on this day. So he could be probably a better liaison with Mark. Than I would be.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:30:27.148Z)

Yeah, yeah. And I was hoping that. I was hoping that. And I know what I think has happened is that I think Mark has. Well, anyway, I don't know. I'm not even gonna go there, so I'm just gonna say yes. And I appreciate you. I appreciate Drew's calmness. I appreciate his perspective. I think he's a great partner. I'm really happy to have him as part of this. Okay, so let's just end this on a past. So I'm gonna share that deck. To our team site. And then you'll find it if you could clean it up, because this almost like. Let's just let Mark and Drew run for a week with what they have, and in the end, I think it's gonna look more like a pitch deck to a customer.

### You (2025-09-11T16:31:13.629Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:31:15.068Z)

Right? And then we can try to introduce the idea that maybe we divide and have two different pitch books. We can put them in the same colors and all of that, that's fine. But if I don't feel good with what they produce by next Tuesday, I'm scared out of my mind. I can't fundraise the right way. So right now, and right now I feel like you've got the technology. You and Vinod have the technology, cover ed. We've got the idea for the mvp, right? We don't need to do anything. I don't. Need to do anything else on that. I just need heads down, focused. Fundraising, and I need a duck to get that done.

### You (2025-09-11T16:31:55.309Z)

Again. I think what you have here on your screen is the deck for fundraising.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:32:01.548Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-11T16:32:01.549Z)

So if you want to work with me, if you want Drew and Larc to give you feedback on this deck, For fundraising.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:32:12.108Z)

That's what I thought I was doing when I sent it on Sunday.

### You (2025-09-11T16:32:14.029Z)

Yeah, well, I think that might be an excuse for you to get with Drew on the phone.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:32:21.708Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T16:32:21.869Z)

And do the exact same thing. Say this is the deck. Even you can mention that you and I spoke and that we're in agreement that we need two decks, not one. And see if he's got some input. That would be fine. But, yeah, we do need to get something together. And if I were in your shoes, I would say if we can't align on something by Tuesday, I'm going to take my deck and run with it. And it is what it is.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:32:55.708Z)

I have to raise the money. I mean, Mark sitting in a house in the Hamptons, and I'm a cashier at Kroger, right? So. And I know he puts that down, but the time's up. We were working on this for free long enough and we now we should have had working capital well in advance of where we are right now.

### You (2025-09-11T16:33:18.189Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:33:18.828Z)

All right. Deck will be on the site. I'll also send you some information about transaction volume and we will talk at 5:30 today.

### You (2025-09-11T16:33:27.069Z)

Perfect.

### Guest (2025-09-11T16:33:29.388Z)

Hi. Have a good Thursday.

### You (2025-09-11T16:33:30.189Z)

We'll see. You.
