### You (2025-06-16T19:00:47.975Z)

Alright. There we go. Now I'm down on mute. Yeah. Hi.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:00:51.427Z)

Howard, you plowed through this weekend

### You (2025-06-16T19:00:51.565Z)

You plowed through this weekend Man, what's your progress?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:00:54.627Z)

Man, what great progress.

### You (2025-06-16T19:00:55.935Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And kinda just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:00:56.847Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-16T19:00:58.615Z)

locked myself up at the cottage and got some stuff knocked out. So It looks so good.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:01:04.857Z)

It looks so good.

### You (2025-06-16T19:01:06.355Z)

I hope so. I am I'm at the point now where I need people to actually start using it. And making sure that it works the way it's supposed to. There's a few formatting things I'm not gonna worry about those right now. But Okay. You know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:01:20.377Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:01:20.755Z)

as long as it makes sense and as you fill in the numbers, push tab, it takes you to the next one. And doesn't have any what they call, persistence. So if you were to create a deal, go in there, put in numbers, log off, and then come in there again, you won't have the same deal there. It's just it'll it'll just work in whatever current session you're in, but that'll also be taken care of by the time we get to the POC.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:01:51.377Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-16T19:01:52.655Z)

### You (2025-06-16T19:02:57.215Z)

what I have created and template.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:02:59.137Z)

Alright. I'm trying to

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:15.505Z)

that entire thing into the application itself.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:16.287Z)

you know, embed that entire thing into the application itself.

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:18.735Z)

Let's see if that works out well. If not, then

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:19.727Z)

Let's see if that works out well. If not, then we'll just create a link

just create a new to land to that page.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:24.427Z)

land to that page.

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:24.675Z)

So I'm kinda working on that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:26.107Z)

available online. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:29.457Z)

it's

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:30.585Z)

you know, I could create a test user

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:30.827Z)

available online user. You know, I could create a test user

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:33.525Z)

and, you know, whoever is demoing or showing it to

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:35.347Z)

and, you know, whoever is demoing or showing it to

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:37.145Z)

any kind. Probably use that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:38.847Z)

any client.

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:39.955Z)

It's basically the user.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:40.477Z)

Probably use that. Space big user.

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:42.425Z)

And kind of go through the application.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:44.217Z)

And kind of, go through the application.

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:45.225Z)

Okay. And for the proof of concept, are we gonna go all the way through, like, the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:47.007Z)

Okay. And for the proof of concept are we gonna go all the way through, like, the return calculation? So the purchase price,

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:50.695Z)

return calculation? So the purchase price the know, the cash on cash return, the IRR calculation.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:54.997Z)

the the cash on cash return, the IRR

### You (2025-06-16T19:03:58.515Z)

What do you guys looking in terms of the actual, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:03:59.557Z)

What what are you guys thinking in terms of the actual, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:03.885Z)

valuation part of it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:04.887Z)

valuation part of it?

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:05.665Z)

Yeah. I'm I'm hoping to be able to just get some inputs. I mean, they could be totally made up numbers, or real numbers,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:14.007Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:14.055Z)

But, yeah, I think we we we may want to go in stages

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:22.147Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:23.915Z)

Depending on who is doing the testing for us, You know, if it's somebody you know really well, mean, we could have them take a look at it tomorrow. To just to go through all that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:36.007Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:38.175Z)

But yeah. I mean, we will eventually want to be able to get all of that as well for the proof of concept. So Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:47.627Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:53.255Z)

So where wanna start today? Do we wanna go back

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:55.087Z)

So where do we wanna start today? Do we wanna go back

### You (2025-06-16T19:04:56.495Z)

through Howard, what you had sent us earlier or last night about the like, the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:04:58.377Z)

through, Howard, what you had sent us earlier or last night about the

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:01.765Z)

six minute thing here you did on what you had added and the way that it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:05:03.287Z)

like, the six minute video you did on what you had added and the way that it

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:05.405Z)

gets ordered, or is that the best

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:05:07.207Z)

gets ordered, or is that the best place to start, or is there another place to start?

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:07.475Z)

place to start, or is there another place to start? I mean, I I could go back through it. I don't know if everybody's watched the video, but it's probably not necessary to go through it. If you haven't watched the video, I can do that. But but, yeah, I do have a couple questions in terms of layout and a couple other things. So So let's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:05:28.107Z)

So let's turn it back. Watched it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:28.695Z)

it. So I'm

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:05:30.877Z)

So I'm

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:30.975Z)

caught up on everything yet. I apologize. No. That's that's fine. Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:05:33.277Z)

up on everything yet, so I apologize.

### You (2025-06-16T19:05:35.825Z)

Alright. Yeah. Let me let me go ahead and bring it up. Alright. So, should be able to see my screen now. Right now, it's showing the reports. Tab. So I did not do anything new other than I I'm Drew, you weren't here last week as well. So I'll I'll I'll quickly touch on some of the stuff that I did last week as well. So Drew, one of the things I added here is the ability to upload a thumbnail. So that as the users are creating a deal, there's going to be what we call the pipeline or the the deal list, whatever we wanna name it. Where all the deals that they're underwriting and working on will be there. And and, you know, we can add a a little thumbnail to each one. Right? Just a nice little thing to have in the list. Already went through this. I'm I'm sure, Drew, you saw this before you left. So we've got the dropdown list here where you can select a single item or you know, you could just go back up If you only wanted to to to forecast just at the highest food and beverage level, you can just click the top one. No no no real changes there. Market analysis, no changes there. That's just the static page. The only thing that I did last week, Mark, is or Drew is is I changed, Mark had suggested that we take off the names since this was a real report that we had in there just to take off the names. And so I just Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:07:21.117Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-16T19:07:21.835Z)

Made them comp one through four. So the real the real things that have been happening here over the last week or so now is getting back to this this valuation page. So the idea is to have a single page where you can scroll through and create the different sections so each item that you have to input the user for their forecasting is going to be highlighted in yellow. Drew, I think you've seen already the occupancy, the ADR, things that we have there. But what happened is as I'm starting to go through and add all these this sidebar over here was getting quite long One of the things that I worked on over the weekend is to make this a lot easier for the users to navigate. So you know, here, obviously, the occupancy is the top one already. So if I click on here, it doesn't really do much. Other than just bringing it up to a different section.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:08:24.027Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:08:27.685Z)

But now as we go through the revenue section, you can see now revenue and expense are broken out into their own sections over on the sidebar simply because there's so many items. Probably keep going as I do some of the more nonoperated or the the non allocated, like the in taxes, insurance, everything else, when I break those out, probably be another group there. So expenses, last time we met, and I think last thing you saw, we had the rooms expense budget there, other operated So what I also added over the weekend are the undistributed expenses. So we've got the property operations maintenance, admin in general, info, sales, and utilities. I put these in here in order of what I'm used to doing in in a multifamily. These are kind of the order of the expenses that they're laid out but I just took a guess. It's it's easy to rearrange these. So if you guys think that there should be a different order, just go ahead and pop pop an email or or put a chat in there. I I can go ahead and change that around. Nonoperating expenses, I just have the high level here. I have an email from Mark about the real estate taxes, insurance, that they're all usually based on the maybe always. I don't know. Maybe based on the, percentage of revenue So that's another thing we need to to to take a look at is right now, with expenses, you can choose whether you wanna budget or forecast on an ADI or percentage of revenue. If there are any items in here that do not use ADR, for example, there may not ever be a case where you wanna do the non operating on ADR level. Or utilities or whatever, let me know. And we'll just you know, I can just fix these to to be Can I can I just send it Diane? Have you seen it done based on ADR?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:41.467Z)

Yeah. Can I can I just Diane, have you seen it done based on ADR? We were talking about POR, right, on the expenses?

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:47.395Z)

Expenses. Right. POR, seen it, but not ADR. Yeah. That was just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:51.057Z)

Right. POR, I've seen, but not ADR.

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:51.735Z)

be a double major thing. I think

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:53.567Z)

And that might just be a

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:54.355Z)

It could as far as, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:54.907Z)

nomenclature thing. I think

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:55.225Z)

Yeah. But I think the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:56.647Z)

as far as, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:57.555Z)

calculation

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:10:57.907Z)

but I think the

### You (2025-06-16T19:10:58.555Z)

that how we've been talking about, anyway, is p to r.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:00.247Z)

calculation that how we've been talking about anyway is POR.

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:02.085Z)

Okay. Yep. That makes sense then. Okay. If it's p o r. Yes.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:04.747Z)

Okay. Oh, that that makes sense then. Okay. If it's POR, yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:05.765Z)

Yeah. I I I've that's right. It was brought up last week, and I just forgot to change the name on that. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:11.427Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:11.575Z)

Okay. Alright. Sorry about the confusion there. No. No. It's I'm I think we're all on this link.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:15.217Z)

No. It's

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:17.685Z)

Cough drop.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:18.597Z)

I think we're all just, like, awestruck when we're looking

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:21.735Z)

This is great. One thing

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:23.057Z)

I mean, Howard, is great. One thing on the

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:23.145Z)

on the top box where you said historical, the rooms, key available room type

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:26.437Z)

top box where you say historical, the rooms key, available rooms, occupied rooms,

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:27.685Z)

white rooms. Yeah. And occupancy. Is that is that just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:30.997Z)

and

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:31.475Z)

intended to be, like, a constant?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:31.747Z)

occupancy. Is that is that just

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:32.965Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:34.047Z)

intended to be, like, a constant?

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:34.535Z)

Yes. So Exactly. You could also include

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:35.667Z)

Okay. Because I I think

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:37.025Z)

ADR in that? Well, here here here's here's what I here's how I've got it set up. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:38.717Z)

should also include ADR in that.

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:42.795Z)

as we are looking at the you so remember last week I showed where we've got the tabs on the top? So here's I understand, but I think that, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:49.977Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:53.405Z)

users were

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:53.507Z)

But but I just I I I understand, but I I think that, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:54.125Z)

never think about looking at occupancy with them. Right? They're kind of, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:56.077Z)

users would never think about looking at occupancy without rate. They're kind of like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:11:57.105Z)

it's like peanut butter jelly, just sort of go in tandem.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:11:59.727Z)

it's like peanut butter and jelly. They just sort of go, in tandem.

### You (2025-06-16T19:12:00.155Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I okay. So my my assumption is that we would work on the occupancy section here because some of this is gonna be on the calculations here. But now when you go to the revenue, we do have the occupancy ADR, RevPar,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:12:15.417Z)

Oh, then you repeat it both. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:12:17.115Z)

up on top there. And then Drew, I this is something else that I did over the last week is because we do have so many line items over here, the the more items I include on top, the less room I have down here. Right? So if I expand the the revenue notice now I only have a handful of rows here. So the more that we have up here, the more difficult it is to work. Down in the valuation section. So I've got that. But then my question is, is I want to make sure I understood Mark's request last week is that, you know, this he he had asked that we have the ADR and the RevPar and everything on each screen, so I've got on on the revenue. But I also have it on the expenses. Do you have you know, it seems to me, you know, the ADR and the RevPar are revenue specific. Do we still want to have these on the expense tab? Or only the revenue tab?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:16.877Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:17.015Z)

I I

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:19.357Z)

I

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:19.365Z)

think that's right. I don't think

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:20.947Z)

I

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:21.205Z)

need me.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:22.187Z)

that that's fine. I don't think you even need all these other

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:22.725Z)

This is just me. But the other item is out there that are

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:25.437Z)

this is just me But the other items you have there that are

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:27.475Z)

that are gonna remain, right, so total other operators. Yeah. That one. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:30.107Z)

that are gonna remain. Right? So total other operated yeah. That one.

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:32.445Z)

Like, I don't think you need that to ever be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:35.177Z)

I don't think you need that

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:35.395Z)

included in

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:36.587Z)

to ever be

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:37.685Z)

the stuff that's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:38.097Z)

included in the the stuff that's always showing

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:38.935Z)

showing. User go down to that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:42.477Z)

because

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:42.835Z)

section. When they wanna see it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:43.477Z)

users will go down to that section

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:46.065Z)

That that's Yeah. I I agree with Drew. Yeah. We probably have

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:46.167Z)

when they wanna see it. Yeah. I I I I agree with Drew. I I think that as long as we have

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:49.665Z)

occupancy rate ADR, that's kinda enough industry standard

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:52.397Z)

occupancy rate and ADR, that's kinda the

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:53.645Z)

kind of basic dataset that's always repeated.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:54.657Z)

industry standard kind of basic dataset that's always repeated.

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:56.105Z)

K. Yeah. And I'll give you all and,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:13:58.677Z)

Yeah. And Aug ADR and RevPAR,

### You (2025-06-16T19:13:59.155Z)

You should really almost think of them the way you would, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:01.757Z)

you should really almost think of them the way you would, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:01.945Z)

get multifamily and, like, square feet of office space.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:04.627Z)

in multifamily as, like, square feet of office space.

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:06.975Z)

No more than you. It it's the whole

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:08.507Z)

Or, you know, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:09.305Z)

fundamental to

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:09.727Z)

number of you it's it's so fundamental to revenues, expense to everything that the hotel does.

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:13.385Z)

everything that the hotel does. Right. It it it I mean, obviously,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:17.807Z)

It it it's it I mean, obviously, it drives revenue that's

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:21.425Z)

but it it impacts everything because

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:22.967Z)

first thing that it does, but it it impacts everything because

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:23.415Z)

expenses, whatnot are often tied to the revenue you generate

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:25.997Z)

expenses and whatnot are often tied to the revenue you generate in the rooms you

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:27.595Z)

yourself. Right? You know? Yeah. The vast majority of the expenses you have. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:30.487Z)

sell. Like, you know, the vast majority of the expenses you have. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:30.925Z)

So if always going to be relevant. I what you're looking at. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:14:33.537Z)

So it's always going to be relevant. No matter pretty much no matter what you're looking at.

### You (2025-06-16T19:14:36.875Z)

Let's keep in mind the reason why I added this section up here to be visible at all times is because as you're scrolling up and down here, you you don't necessarily see the effect. So by having this section here, always visible, as I go through my future forecast example. You know, right now everything is by default. So as I input a value here, it's going to show the effect of well actually look at that. I'm seeing it doesn't show that. I'm going have to look it I think

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:15.987Z)

I see what you're but I see what you're getting at. I think

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:16.115Z)

talking about Yeah. Yeah. So Perhaps a more

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:21.607Z)

perhaps a

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:22.445Z)

way do that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:23.197Z)

more concise

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:23.625Z)

Just to show

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:24.937Z)

way to do that would just be to show

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:26.515Z)

like, gross operating profit

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:27.467Z)

like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:28.665Z)

and

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:29.647Z)

gross operating profit

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:29.875Z)

EBITDA. Or score

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:31.347Z)

and EBITDA.

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:32.345Z)

know, EBITDA, like, I believe.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:33.387Z)

Or or

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:33.995Z)

Or or otherwise

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:34.717Z)

you know, EBITDA less f f and e.

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:35.175Z)

often called an upgrade. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:36.687Z)

Or or otherwise often called net operating income.

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:36.865Z)

Mhmm. Those would be right. Like, if

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:39.507Z)

Those would be

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:40.215Z)

just a second. I could go

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:41.787Z)

right. Like, if the user's gonna look at like, the way all of our dashboards in our our our site are set up, users will look at ARC ADR RevPAR,

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:48.655Z)

and then sort of think of that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:51.377Z)

and then sort of the next

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:52.065Z)

We made your KPIs

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:53.537Z)

three major KPIs

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:53.755Z)

are NOI. Okay. NOI behavior.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:56.537Z)

are revenue, GOP, and NOI.

### You (2025-06-16T19:15:57.845Z)

Okay. Those are the six those

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:15:59.347Z)

NOI being EBITDA less FF and E.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:01.425Z)

things, like, they

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:02.477Z)

Those are the six state those six things, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:04.355Z)

they

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:05.027Z)

they they are you I mean, we look at them a 100 different ways.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:09.065Z)

Okay. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:09.397Z)

But they they are the most commonly looked at.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:10.925Z)

I think that would be So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:12.927Z)

So I think that would be an easier because then, again, if you change expenses, if you change revenue, right, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:17.845Z)

Right. Okay. And that's really

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:19.697Z)

it's gonna impact the profit.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:20.885Z)

what you sort of are looking at at at, you know, what is my profit?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:22.287Z)

And that's really what users are are looking at at at knowing, you know, what is my profit.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:24.105Z)

Yeah. More so than what what are my expenses? Okay. Okay. So okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:27.357Z)

More so than what are what are my expenses at at, you know, alignment.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:29.405Z)

Alright. That makes sense. So so you got occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, gross profit, EBITDA, and what was the others? You said six. Well,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:41.377Z)

Well,

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:42.705Z)

r and then revenue, you know, fees.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:44.447Z)

ARC ADR RevPAR and then revenue GOP EBITDA less FF and E. So you already have the three.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:47.705Z)

Three. Yeah. And then the other

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:51.007Z)

AKA d r, RevPAR,

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:51.415Z)

three, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:52.917Z)

and then the other three, you know, revenue, total revenue. Total revenue. Right? Because then that's

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:57.415Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:16:57.827Z)

the food and beverage. Yep. And yep.

### You (2025-06-16T19:16:58.275Z)

Would you want to analyze the percentage of total revenue

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:03.127Z)

You wanna show NOI as a percentage of total revenue, or is that are we getting carried away?

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:03.755Z)

to carry away?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:07.187Z)

I mean, if you really wanted to get fancy, you'd be able to change those to be POR

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:14.015Z)

PFR PAR percent of revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:15.417Z)

to, you know, amount POR, PAR percent of revenue.

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:17.895Z)

That's a a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:18.807Z)

But I don't necessarily know that's a a

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:18.995Z)

something we need to do right now.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:22.047Z)

something we need to do right now. I could always add that later.

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:23.865Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And also remember, we are gonna have the summary report here.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:26.737Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:28.355Z)

So yeah. So the question is,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:17:31.787Z)

Yeah. I think that's yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:17:31.905Z)

what what can we show on the summary tab versus what do we want in this valuation box up here. So this is designed to guide the user in comparing the historical and then carrying forward through the forecast period for the metrics that they need to complete a valuation. You know, it will be redundant, obviously. On the summary tab. We're still going have that same information laid out just like they are on the sample spreadsheets that I've gotten from Mark and Diane. They both had very similar summary layouts. But, yeah, I think that that's that's good guidance today if we just have those six rows. Being able to toggle between the natural dollar amount or percentages is not a problem either. If you did want to have a seventh row, that's not bad. I mean, because if you go here to the rooms revenue, we got one, two, three, four, We'll call this six, because there's two. So so, I mean, this would have this many rows. There was something else we wanted to add. And this is Okay. Once we get a little bit bigger than seven, you can see then we're really kind of running out of real estate down here. And and this is on a you know, I'm I'm I'm sharing my it's a 42 inch monitor. So if somebody was working on the laptop, it would be even smaller. Right? So Yeah. I'm actually I'm actually looking at it on the laptop, it's, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:19:09.527Z)

Yeah. I'm actually

### You (2025-06-16T19:19:12.435Z)

I have my glasses off, but it's it's pretty

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:19:12.877Z)

I'm actually looking at it on a laptop, and it's, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T19:19:14.345Z)

pretty well visible.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:19:15.207Z)

have my glasses on, but it's it's pretty pretty well visible.

### You (2025-06-16T19:19:15.495Z)

Yeah. Well, you're seeing my 42 inch screen on your laptop if you brought this up on your laptop, you would you would be fewer than than what it would be. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:19:24.457Z)

No wonder.

### You (2025-06-16T19:19:26.615Z)

And and you would have to probably scroll

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:19:27.537Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:19:30.185Z)

over depending on the number of columns, Which is why, you know, I made this collapsible, so on a laptop then, you'll have more room width wise, but still the number of rows. But either way, I mean, these are all things we have to run past users. And get their feedback as well. But I can go ahead and make those changes that we just talked about up here. I I feel better about that too because, yeah, once you start, like, getting into the expense and you have all these rows, and if you wanna take a look at the total other operated, the total undistributed, plus the ones that aren't even here yet, I mean, I'm I'm totally out of space down here. I can barely even get this thing to scroll on a big screen. So Yeah. I don't think we should have. Okay. That. That's some of the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:15.577Z)

Yeah. I don't think we need to have all that

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:16.595Z)

stat quick. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:17.367Z)

that up there. I think that's

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:18.375Z)

Level of detail.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:18.727Z)

somebody's gonna look

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:19.955Z)

They're

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:20.027Z)

only gonna look at that level of detail if they're manipulating at that level of detail.

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:24.325Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:25.487Z)

They can look at it on the summary.

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:25.945Z)

Alright. Good. No. That makes sense. That makes sense. I mean, in a in a multifamily or other items, they would insist on having those lines. So I'm trying not to copy everything that I've done in the past.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:39.717Z)

A two.

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:41.415Z)

But but yeah. No. I I understand how that works. It's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:20:42.437Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:20:44.525Z)

it's good. I mean, I've always tried to get people not to focus on the minutiae in their underwriting. Just look at it at the top level. But so cool. Okay. I can make that. Looks really cool. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:00.037Z)

Yeah. This is this is, this looks really cool.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:00.505Z)

Good. Yeah. The returns on top, we're I think

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:02.347Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:03.345Z)

people didn't really like that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:03.617Z)

Yeah. The returns on top are really I think people are gonna really like that.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:04.485Z)

Yeah. That. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:07.327Z)

Just a very unique way of presenting it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:07.345Z)

Yeah. And I

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:09.487Z)

And

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:09.665Z)

think last time,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:10.867Z)

Howard did

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:10.985Z)

we spoke about difference between

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:12.567Z)

I think last time,

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:13.735Z)

you know, how higher

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:13.867Z)

we spoke about

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:15.315Z)

department hire

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:15.357Z)

difference between, you know, account hierarchy and department hierarchy.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:17.575Z)

the I I really like

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:20.487Z)

I and I'm I bring it up because I see that, like, it looks like they're intermingled. Some of these. Like, if you open up

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:28.705Z)

or if somebody shares for all the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:28.897Z)

like, other operated like, where there was somebody who showed other operated revenue. There was, like, resort fee

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:37.985Z)

Resort

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:39.037Z)

These some have, like, food and beverage, and then they have resort fee and other operated and miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:41.005Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:43.897Z)

And this is Howard, you can weigh in here if you want. But I think in your model, you had resort fees broken out because you were looking at some place that had resort fees.

### You (2025-06-16T19:21:53.475Z)

Would say, well, in particular, you know, some

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:21:55.687Z)

And I was saying that while in a particular, you know, some in some cases that might be really important, know, in in other cases, it's

### You (2025-06-16T19:22:01.985Z)

not You know?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:22:04.677Z)

it's not going to be, you know, not gonna be resort fees. So this is the four main operating revenues would always be rooms, food and beverage, other operated miscellaneous. Those were your four main departments. And if you wanna break out resort fees or you know, rental or

### You (2025-06-16T19:22:21.595Z)

It it goes, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:22:22.797Z)

spa retail, whatever, it it it goes, you know, within one of those four areas. So resort fee becomes part of miscellaneous

### You (2025-06-16T19:22:23.605Z)

on those four Yeah. There's what we got as part of miscellaneous. Rather than its own thing. Yeah. Alright. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:22:31.147Z)

rather than its own thing.

### You (2025-06-16T19:22:31.785Z)

going to let you and Mark arm wrestle about this because because I originally had it set up with those four groups.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:22:35.827Z)

Mark Mark, what do you

### You (2025-06-16T19:22:38.715Z)

Mark Mark had requested that maybe we just break it out, which is why it's on its own here. I'm I'm open to whichever way works best. Because remember, you you can I don't remember where resort fees if it was under miscellaneous or other other operated? Under miscellaneous, usually? Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, if we had resort fees

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:02.267Z)

Under miscellaneous usually.

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:06.245Z)

here, you could you know, either include it or exclude it. Yeah. If I call with that, is are such a big component of revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:13.207Z)

Yeah. My thought was that resort fees are such a big

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:15.215Z)

Sort of working? With some line.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:16.137Z)

component of revenue these days that it's sort of worthy of its own line. But

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:16.635Z)

But yeah, in why

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:19.937Z)

Yeah. And I I agree that in a lot of cases, they are. However, I'd say probably 75% of the hotels that are gonna be underwritten aren't gonna have resort fees with all the select

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:25.455Z)

the parking lot resort.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:30.137Z)

service. Right? Like, if all of our hotels that we have

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:31.895Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:33.157Z)

mean, it's only 300, but, like, you know, probably only 50 of them have resort fees.

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:36.325Z)

You know, you have

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:37.517Z)

Albeit, they're significant revenue, but

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:38.895Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:39.287Z)

you know, the other all the select service and, you know, more urban stuff just doesn't

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:40.345Z)

stuff. It's a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:43.927Z)

doesn't have that Yeah. But there are there are a lot of full service and luxury and resort that hopefully will be Oh, yeah. No. I 100%. And I think that's why they'll they'll like, when somebody's underwriting those, they will they will

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:52.575Z)

they

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:56.117Z)

expand these boxes, and they'll be adding, you know, a line for

### You (2025-06-16T19:23:57.585Z)

for you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:23:59.707Z)

spa, for retail, for

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:01.135Z)

they wanna break down

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:01.397Z)

you know, all kinds of other revenue streams that they wanna break out in

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:02.355Z)

You know, in isolation, and I

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:05.897Z)

you know, in isolation. And I'd so

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:06.025Z)

so the resort basically becomes more of that one of But

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:09.547Z)

resort fees just becomes one of one of

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:10.365Z)

for several.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:11.957Z)

likely one of several That's My and the only reason I bring it up is that I I might I'm also thinking about getting the data in the first place.

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:18.905Z)

Fatality they got in

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:19.797Z)

Like, how is the date like, Sally, lays out data in a certain way.

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:20.585Z)

way? And I wanna try I wanna make it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:24.377Z)

And I wanna try to I wanna make it

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:27.245Z)

easy for us. Get data

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:29.707Z)

easy for us to get data

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:29.995Z)

Like, you know, I don't want I don't want their gaps. If we And, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:33.037Z)

Like, I don't I don't want I don't want there to be big gaps if we if, you know, if

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:33.955Z)

to get our support, you can help. Have. Resort fees broken out.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:36.897Z)

a particular summary p and l doesn't have

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:37.565Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:39.277Z)

resort fees broken out,

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:39.465Z)

I I want to get paid out to, like, a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:40.587Z)

like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:42.405Z)

summary

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:42.447Z)

I want it I want it to be easy for us to get data from, a summary p and l

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:42.765Z)

you know, Yeah. The only thing we can say for for political

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:46.417Z)

in every case.

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:47.435Z)

present certainty is that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:47.807Z)

And the only thing we can say for for 100% certainty is that a summary p and l from every operator is going to have rooms revenue,

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:54.655Z)

you know, those

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:24:55.617Z)

SME revenue, other operated miscellaneous. You know, those four revenue streams we've broken out on the on the summary page.

### You (2025-06-16T19:24:58.225Z)

weeks. You

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:25:01.607Z)

Of note, there might be other things too, but that's there's no guarantee.

### You (2025-06-16T19:25:02.385Z)

Yeah. That is something that we've talked about as well, that we want this to be consistent with however the the users are used to uploading it either HPIS or the STAR report or whatever that we wanna make sure there's that one to one correlation So you know, that that that's a good point. If resort fees are tucked under another group as a subcategory under miscellaneous, then I'd I agree that's that's where it should probably be. Now remember, and I know it's kinda hard. You're just gonna have to visualize this. I I haven't done it in this, but if I go through here, and if resort fees are under miscellaneous, what is going to be showing up on the valuation page is whatever item is selected here. So if I select and put a check mark on resort fees, when we get to the valuation portion and we go down to that other operated revenue, there will be a an actual line here to budget resort fees. Right now, we just had the big roll up for miscellaneous. I haven't gotten to the point yet where we can actually drill down into additional layers. But if we did have that, rather than budgeting miscellaneous as just one row, we would have, say, resort fees here and whatever the other miscellaneous or anything that we have, you'd have two or three lines here. And then everything that would then just roll up into my total miscellaneous down here. Right? So that hierarchy in that property details modal is what's going to control what's here. So if there's a if, you know, if it's a hotel that doesn't have any food and beverage. Right, or anything like that, You this it won't even be here. This this section won't even show on this page. If there's nothing to compare with the past, or nothing to forecast, I'm not gonna waste the the space by having it here. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:27:31.107Z)

Yeah. I think that makes sense.

### You (2025-06-16T19:27:31.245Z)

Yeah. K. What else? Any any anything else?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:27:50.777Z)

Diane, do you wanna weigh in on the resort fee? No worried about the resort fee. I feel like, you know, Mark and I are different opinions there, but so they're clear. Of of the opinion that like, Drew, like, when you say if you have lines that aren't used often,

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:03.975Z)

Then

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:07.297Z)

then your p and l has, like, nothing in the in in, like, the middle of the revenue

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:09.825Z)

So if there's a way to can

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:12.087Z)

Right? So if there's a way that we can expand it,

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:13.475Z)

we needed, that's great. Collapse

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:16.107Z)

for when you need it, that's great, but then collapse it

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:16.115Z)

it the 75% of hotels that don't need it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:19.397Z)

for the 75% of hotels that don't use it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:19.915Z)

Is is that possible how are you gonna

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:23.017Z)

Is is that a possibility, Howard? That that's how we're saying it. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:23.515Z)

Yeah. That's exactly what I was just explaining there. So when they're setting up the deal for the first time and they go here into this section,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:27.337Z)

Okay. That code. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:32.585Z)

if resort fees are under miscellaneous, if they don't have resort fees,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:33.747Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:38.175Z)

You know, if they check here, that's going to automatically include everything down here. But if they don't have resort fees and they go down here and they say,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:28:49.257Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:28:50.885Z)

oh, but I've got miscellaneous income and expenses. I can check that. Then it will in include resort fees up here. Let me go to one that has multiple Okay. So food and beverage, kitchen, minor F and B. So if this one say it has a coffee shop, you notice how none of these other items are checked. And if it has a coffee shop, and a bar. I can do that. So those are the only items that will show up. You when they go through here, there won't be any item displayed on that page for anything regarding banquets and catering, kitchen, anything else. So it'll be the same thing down here for the miscellaneous. If they did have resort fees, all they have to do is check the box. Does that make sense? Yes. And only on how add is

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:29:44.807Z)

Yes. And the only other thing I'll

### You (2025-06-16T19:29:45.565Z)

that, like, a resort fee is probably the other driver within the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:29:48.217Z)

add is that, like, a resort fee is probably the only revenue item within miscellaneous that might need to get called out, checked,

### You (2025-06-16T19:29:52.475Z)

and brought to the surface. Probably, other line item that pulls up in the facility would be too small.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:29:55.577Z)

and brought to the surface. Probably any other line item that

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:00.005Z)

To touch.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:00.127Z)

rolls up in a miscellaneous would be too small to actually include

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:00.455Z)

Actually include. Break it out on the on the overall summary, you know, if that makes sense. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:04.637Z)

to break it out on the on the overall summary p and l, if that makes sense.

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:06.865Z)

Okay. Yeah. So in that case, if under miscellaneous

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:09.247Z)

Right. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:12.005Z)

the resort fee is the only item they checked. When they come over here and go into the other operated revenue, in the miscellaneous section here, it'll still say miscellaneous but this will say resort fees. Okay. And then they can come over here

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:29.007Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:30.995Z)

input their resort fees, and then it will be used to calculate their total revenue. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:38.517Z)

Mhmm. And there are there are other items that

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:39.385Z)

Yeah. Are

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:42.527Z)

get are in miscellaneous that are, you know, not as common. Resort fees are certainly the most most prominent. You have other things like attrition and cancellation fees,

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:51.805Z)

like rental income from leasing out

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:53.557Z)

rental ex like, rental income from leasing out space.

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:54.195Z)

space. Right? The fact that bring it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:30:57.907Z)

Right? Like, that gets put in miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-16T19:30:58.575Z)

The probably too two other ones that come up

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:01.337Z)

Those are probably two the two other

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:02.525Z)

Yeah. They have the most significant revenue contribution other than resort fees.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:04.207Z)

ones that come up that have the most significant revenue contribution other than resort fees.

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:09.415Z)

You know, And

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:10.657Z)

But, yeah, it's it's only it is it is a

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:11.055Z)

or I don't experience

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:12.887Z)

you know, handful of

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:13.685Z)

specific items. Would get into service.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:14.947Z)

accounts very account specific items that they would get serviced.

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:15.605Z)

Okay. Alright. No. Very helpful. I appreciate the the help with that. How's it foodie members when we

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:26.647Z)

Howard, where is food and beverage when we when we were looking at the revenues? You've got ADR, RevPAR rooms, I know you did a lot of work on food and beverage, but I don't see

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:34.455Z)

on the what we call the very left

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:37.647Z)

on the

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:38.355Z)

hand side of bar that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:38.947Z)

what would you call on the very left hand side, the bar that

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:41.055Z)

On the sidebar? Yeah. Yeah. The sidebar. It's it's it's a part of the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:43.687Z)

right Yeah. Yeah. The sidebar.

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:45.975Z)

other operated revenue group. Got it. Okay. So here's my other operated, and so you can see everything else

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:49.127Z)

Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:52.305Z)

below it is kind of indented. So Got it. Got my main category,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:31:55.297Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:31:56.835Z)

then subcategories down here. Yep. That's my thing. I one now would be just to pull food on our

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:02.937Z)

That my suggestion, Juan, that would be just to pull food and beverage into its

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:03.575Z)

own. Sidebar. Because it's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:06.647Z)

own line item on the sidebar because it's it's

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:06.935Z)

as it's kind of bigger or I don't know it can be hotel soap operas.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:10.567Z)

of as big as rooms. It can be for hotels. So rooms, food and beverage, and then

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:10.625Z)

Is put it that way. And then as Drew said, who's miscellaneous and other or other miscellaneous. My dyslexic brain Yeah. You know, I would agree.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:15.457Z)

as Drew said, miscellaneous and other or other and miscellaneous. My dyslexic brain them confused. I would yeah. I would agree with that. Because if you'll even see right here, you have other operated revenue and then food and beverage, but then two rows down, you have

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:25.165Z)

But then two of those down, you have other operating again. Yeah. Yeah. So I think, yeah,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:29.977Z)

other operated again.

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:31.385Z)

important to say, yes. We're

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:32.917Z)

So I think, yeah, important to say, yeah, just

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:33.325Z)

the suite of metrics. And that you know, what you have now is other operating revenue on that left sidebar, which is being,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:35.787Z)

room, food and beverage, and then you know, what you have now is other operated revenue on that left sidebar would just be, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:39.875Z)

other operating this point? Okay. Alright. And, also, a lot of them tell me

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:43.117Z)

other operated and miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:44.865Z)

leased

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:45.207Z)

Also, a lot of hotels have leased

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:45.475Z)

food and beverage, so we have a where would that go?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:48.617Z)

food and beverage, so where would we where would that go?

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:49.115Z)

Howard, I think, this weekend. I mean, should that be a separate

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:51.177Z)

That would end up in miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:53.765Z)

drop down under miscellaneous? Because, again,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:54.367Z)

I mean, should that be a separate

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:56.385Z)

I'm my

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:56.967Z)

drop down under miscellaneous? Because, again,

### You (2025-06-16T19:32:57.435Z)

expectations are full service

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:32:59.687Z)

my expectation is we'll have a lot of full service

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:01.525Z)

So the way that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:03.117Z)

It would be. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:04.065Z)

if like, the the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:04.727Z)

So, like, the way that like, if if, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:05.565Z)

the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:07.747Z)

the the miscellaneous department would have anything that shows on a net basis, again, like, attrition and cancellation, resort fees, and leased income are probably the three most common

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:16.035Z)

that you're looking for label each as opposed to just putting it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:19.187Z)

that you're Will the user be able to

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:20.485Z)

sort of a live basket.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:21.177Z)

label each as opposed to just putting it in a sort of blind basket?

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:21.995Z)

Yeah. Three and, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:25.137Z)

Yes. They they'll be able to pick out from those three and

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:26.425Z)

dozen or so others. They would follow these links.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:29.037Z)

you know, a dozen or so others that would fall into miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:29.255Z)

Okay. So once they click on the demo, go on to the exactly.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:32.457Z)

Okay. So once they click on it, then it'll go on to the Exactly.

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:34.375Z)

It'll show up next know, at its own online within

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:36.517Z)

It'll show up it'll show up as, you know, its own line within

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:38.245Z)

way. Know, within other end of this way. Great.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:33:40.687Z)

within miscellaneous you know, within other and miscellaneous. Great.

### You (2025-06-16T19:33:46.205Z)

Okay. What you're asking is definitely doable. But it's going to be complicated because that means you know, all of these are going to be used in every single model. You're always gonna have the ADR, RevPar, etc. On the expenses. You're always going to have the room expense. But what we're asking is to add as a subgroup anything that the user checks on here. Right? So if they check food and beverage and they save it, then when I come over to the valuation page, I'm gonna need to have food and beverage. Listed over here under the revenue. Somewhere. Whether we just have the other operated like this and then have subcategories, another indentation here. I'm going to have to work on that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:34:44.727Z)

What is

### You (2025-06-16T19:34:45.105Z)

That's it's it could be a lot. So What it's Right there.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:34:50.347Z)

what is what is under if you click on room revenue, right there, up a little bit,

### You (2025-06-16T19:34:55.635Z)

What what what is it you wanna see? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:34:58.937Z)

Okay. I was curious what

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:02.895Z)

Let me this a little to do that. It's not

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:04.317Z)

like, maybe there's another way to to do that that's not it wouldn't be as time consuming. Or or I I feel like I I may maybe I just wanna make sure we're

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:17.975Z)

or not.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:18.577Z)

actually clear what we're like, how we're doing this. Right? We're not

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:21.555Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:22.757Z)

communicating clearly. So the at room revenue line is is the calculation of of

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:35.635Z)

of our Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:38.877Z)

ARC ADR RevPAR. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:40.865Z)

It's actually

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:41.317Z)

Then total room revenue.

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:42.685Z)

ADR times the number of occupied rooms. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:35:58.397Z)

Yeah. Mean, I feel like

### You (2025-06-16T19:35:59.915Z)

Yeah. I think I think it does be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:00.777Z)

yeah. I think I think it does need to be

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:01.975Z)

be. Hopefully, it's not

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:05.627Z)

I mean, I guess,

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:05.715Z)

that much work, but, yeah, it does. It gets really

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:06.547Z)

hopefully, it's not that much work, but, yeah, it does I think it really, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:07.955Z)

you know

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:11.517Z)

room revenue, I guess what I was thinking is maybe you can collapse the ARC ADR or you have not ARC. You have ADR RevPAR, like, in the room's revenue, I guess. Don't know. Never mind. I'm just rambling. Okay. Yeah. I I I think it does

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:36.235Z)

That that that can be a third piece of broken out is

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:39.537Z)

that that SMB note does need to be broken out as as sort of its own

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:48.695Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:36:49.697Z)

It's it's own section there.

### You (2025-06-16T19:36:55.945Z)

Yeah. If if you can know, shoot me an email or give me some screenshots. I mean, what what is it that you mean by having it as its own section?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:13.077Z)

Do we have access to this? Like, if we play around?

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:13.875Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I I sent a link

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:16.677Z)

With it and okay. We go on the one of the links you guys you sent us.

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:18.965Z)

to it. I can I can send it again? So k. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:26.497Z)

K.

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:26.995Z)

Yeah. If you can't

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:29.087Z)

Yeah. I see it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:29.655Z)

find it, Oh, yeah. Did do you have it? Okay. Yeah. I got it. Yeah. If you're not yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:35.527Z)

Oh, yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:37.535Z)

So so, yeah, feel free to go through here and and just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:37:37.567Z)

Yeah. I got it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:37:40.665Z)

start plugging away. I don't care if it's one suggestion or a 100. Know, if there's anything that you want to see change or anything that you'd you'd either is missing etcetera. The only thing I would suggest is let's let's not make a whole lot of changes, you know, aesthetically or anything because we also need to get feedback from the actual users of the product as well. So Yeah. One comment

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:17.617Z)

Yeah. One comment in advance

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:17.725Z)

get older is we have all the expenses laid out.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:20.637Z)

of you getting there is we have all the expenses laid out.

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:21.005Z)

And so gross offer profit in the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:24.107Z)

And so GOP, gross operating

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:24.855Z)

big claim for the way health So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:27.217Z)

profit is a big thing for the hotel industry, but so is the

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:28.325Z)

heart the percentage. Because

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:31.167Z)

margin, the percentage. Because we all kind of have

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:31.415Z)

in our phenomenon. Throat that, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:35.207Z)

you know, in our in our minds, right, that, like, us, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:35.305Z)

you know, you could have a select service hotel that might have a full 50% GOP margin. Right? And then a full service hotel might have a third ify

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:40.177Z)

you could have a select service hotel, and it might have a 48 or a 5050% GOP margin. Right? And then a full service hotel might have a 35 or

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:45.075Z)

or you know, so I think the amount of GOP and then the percentage of GOP

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:48.617Z)

you know so the putting the amount of GOP and then the

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:51.095Z)

is really important

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:38:53.237Z)

percentage of GOP is really important.

### You (2025-06-16T19:38:53.445Z)

Yeah. I think what I'm gonna do is to have that little toggle. Similar to what we have here. Right? We have it in the ADR. We can choose. Do you wanna

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:39:03.007Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:39:04.805Z)

forecast with a flat growth, or do you wanna input each yearly? However you wanna do that. I'd have the same thing for those metrics up here. So up here, we'd have the revenue expense. We could we could set up another tab over here, or we'll figure out how we wanna lay it out up here. But we have a very similar toggle drop down here where they could say, I wanna see it as a dollar I want to see it as a percent. Right? So so every single one of those items can be displayed in both

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:39:37.427Z)

Okay. And GOP is the one in particular that we we tend to look at kind of, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:39:46.755Z)

both at the same time. The dollar and the percentage. We just wanna see if

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:39:50.097Z)

both at the same time, the dollar and the percentage, because we just wanna see if, like, if

### You (2025-06-16T19:39:51.055Z)

like, if if it has a gut check, you know, like, but does this make any sense or any Well price

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:39:55.037Z)

as a gut check, you know, it's like, but does this make any sense, or is it crazy?

### You (2025-06-16T19:39:55.785Z)

In in in that case, rather than having a toggle, we could just have two side by side columns. So for 2021, we'd have our dollar column, percent column, you know, 2022, etcetera. That way they can take take a look whichever way you think is is best. Because I just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:15.337Z)

Is that how would that

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:16.325Z)

books have it. Into a sample piano audio c. But is that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:18.517Z)

because that is how the industry looks at it. Like, if Drew were to shoot you a

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:22.015Z)

screen?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:22.017Z)

sample p and l, you'll see but is that too much for the

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:22.655Z)

The light up. The screen? To make it crowded? That's why I was suggesting the drop down box so you can

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:25.337Z)

screen, the layout of the screen to make it too crowded? Or

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:29.055Z)

view one or the other because

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:29.627Z)

mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:30.665Z)

additionally, instead of having it side by side, which makes it kind of difficult to to look at trends because you always have to skip a column. Right? No matter which one I'm looking to, I have to skip column to see the trend.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:40:42.407Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:40:47.285Z)

Which case, you could also then have it by row. So I could have subject property, occupancy or subject property ADR dollars, subject ADR percent, or, you know, whichever metrics that we're having here. Could have it by row. Which then would expand it down significantly. In fact, we've got, what, six or seven, which means we'd have 14 rows So it'd be very, you know, closer to this. So So so, yeah, that's Yeah. That's one reason why I was

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:15.107Z)

Yeah. I think

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:15.625Z)

lobbying.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:17.977Z)

I think having a yeah, having having a like, you basically I think Howard's saying it becomes hard to look

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:25.665Z)

We don't do it that way.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:26.587Z)

across the page to look at a trend.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:26.765Z)

Like, it works it works what is that way.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:28.997Z)

When you do it that way. Like, it works it works well, if that way is good if you're looking at a PNL, which is, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:32.185Z)

Budget. Right. But it's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:34.467Z)

current year versus

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:34.855Z)

like, fine.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:35.527Z)

budget.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:35.595Z)

Six. Ten years.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:36.587Z)

But if you're starting to look at, like, five, six, ten years of

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:37.165Z)

You know, of calling.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:40.447Z)

you know, of of columns, right, then it becomes really hard to to the audit.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:41.495Z)

And show up to every third column. Yeah. I see.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:44.797Z)

Jump every third column.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:44.875Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:46.897Z)

Yeah. I see.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:47.495Z)

If it's, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:48.237Z)

What you're talking about. Yeah. But I think if it's if it's, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:48.475Z)

just show me the the main you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:41:51.707Z)

just showing that the main you know, revenue, GOP, EBITDA, or NOI.

### You (2025-06-16T19:41:58.935Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:00.837Z)

And then, you know, including a toggle to be able to show

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:05.375Z)

airlines. You know?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:05.557Z)

total revenue, GOP, and NOI as, you know, the

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:06.735Z)

The

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:10.167Z)

they'll be showing as an amount by default. But if you wanna see it on a POR, PAR, percent of revenue basis, you just click a button and it'll it'll adjust that way. That way, you can, you can, you know, easily see that if you want to, but it it doesn't take up any more rows.

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:31.255Z)

I hope

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:34.797Z)

Howard, the other thing I had a question on, the

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:39.285Z)

texture for the market.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:41.947Z)

occupancy section doesn't have anything for, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:44.595Z)

There.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:44.967Z)

the market. I see that in in the ADR section, there's

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:45.495Z)

Market. And subject property. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:48.417Z)

market

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:49.375Z)

There's nothing

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:49.547Z)

comp set, and then subject property.

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:50.495Z)

There's no corresponding

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:51.707Z)

There's nothing there's no corresponding

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:53.195Z)

you know, market offset in the occupancy section.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:55.727Z)

you know, market comp set

### You (2025-06-16T19:42:56.155Z)

Right. So that's that's the question is, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:42:57.957Z)

in the occupancy section.

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:00.535Z)

where are we gonna get that information? I mean, this is the breakout

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:01.947Z)

Which

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:05.825Z)

But, yeah, you're right. If we go into here where they're actually starting to forecast, in the occupancy, there there isn't anything to compare. Currently in

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:17.267Z)

With that,

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:21.365Z)

will

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:21.617Z)

yeah. The STR reports and the market data

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:22.025Z)

be able

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:24.817Z)

will include they will include that.

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:25.435Z)

occupancy for the market for concept.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:27.197Z)

Like, the they will include occupancy for the market and the concept.

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:27.515Z)

Just like they will just like to include the ADR.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:30.997Z)

Just like they will for just like they'll include the ADR.

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:34.095Z)

Okay. Yeah. And it I mean, I think, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:37.307Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:39.475Z)

it's all

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:39.827Z)

And it's I mean, I think, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:40.105Z)

in.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:42.217Z)

it's already in in there. Like, if you if I scroll down,

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:42.275Z)

Red bar, market concept w property price,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:45.847Z)

RevPAR has

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:46.675Z)

Right. Yes.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:47.137Z)

market concept subject property. Right? So

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:47.725Z)

Yep. So we now, like, you just did what whatever.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:50.757Z)

so, yeah, like, you're just displaying whatever is the the market

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:51.235Z)

Market constant times market is the auto still keep the market by part of them.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:55.487Z)

occupancy times market ADR is going to equal market RevPAR. So

### You (2025-06-16T19:43:55.985Z)

I don't know

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:43:59.547Z)

I don't know if these numbers are

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:00.645Z)

But No. They they they will. Yeah. As as I change the the numbers up here, it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:01.557Z)

just plugs or if there are calculations in the background, but I think, theoretically,

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:05.465Z)

will change the percentages down here. So it's not just a static display. Okay. So there might already be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:15.227Z)

Okay. So there is a

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:15.275Z)

there must already be market in

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:16.997Z)

so there there must already be a comp there must already be a

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:18.045Z)

comps that occupancy somewhere.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:20.317Z)

market and

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:20.985Z)

Got it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:21.657Z)

comp set occupancy

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:22.295Z)

Somewhere.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:23.667Z)

somewhere

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:23.995Z)

It it's it's right it's right here above.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:24.527Z)

you know, calculation somewhere in the data model. Just to keep Is it in the market analysis?

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:28.265Z)

So so you've got your

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:29.747Z)

Is it

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:30.075Z)

I mean, I I copied this

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:44:30.457Z)

okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:44:32.145Z)

basically exactly as it was in Mark's model. So there was a row here for the market from hotel horizons and Lark you've got your comp set. Which is coming from the STR or the trend report. Got the subject property ADR. And the subject property ADR is dependent upon whatever forecasts I have up here in the occupancy, etcetera, and the year over year growth. So this number will change as I change my assumptions And that's why these numbers are calculating. So, now these numbers are fixed static numbers that were basically copied from the Excel. So we do need to have the ability then to import these numbers from these data sources based on where this hotel is located. Right? So I'm assuming that we're going to have access to this data Or if not, we'll have to have a manual input where the user can input it. Which I hope we don't have to have them do that. The idea is to automate this data

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:45:48.257Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:45:50.145Z)

No. I think that's pretty like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:45:53.057Z)

And and I think, yeah, that's pretty

### You (2025-06-16T19:45:53.445Z)

it should be Yeah. Yeah. With the with the market forecast, they

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:45:56.447Z)

like, it should be easy to get. That data. The the the market forecast data and then the concept data historical part of it will come from STR, and the user can project what they think

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:06.755Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:09.277Z)

concept's gonna do and then project what they think their property is gonna do. But I but, yeah, I was I I think it there should be an occupancy component of that as well. So you you're

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:21.395Z)

The market, for the concept of the property, if you go to 60

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:23.547Z)

forecasting occupancy for the market, for the concept of the property, then you're doing the same for ADR.

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:26.185Z)

part. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:28.417Z)

Then it'll calculate RevPAR. I mean or, I mean, Mark, do you your model is sounds like it's built differently. You you're calculating you're just forecasting

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:33.745Z)

ADR and rest, and and RevPAR.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:37.467Z)

ADR and ref and then and RevPAR and and occupancy is a calculation. Is that how you guys do it? Well, no. Typically,

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:45.195Z)

Occupancy

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:45.397Z)

mean, you would enter

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:45.955Z)

from store, and then you would do a penetration, and then

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:46.637Z)

market occupancy and rate

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:48.945Z)

analysis.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:49.717Z)

from STOREB, and then you would do a penetration analysis

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:49.775Z)

To show what percentage you wanna penetrate market. Each year.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:53.227Z)

to show what percentage you wanna penetrate market

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:55.445Z)

Thank you. Thank you. You

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:56.607Z)

each year.

### You (2025-06-16T19:46:57.165Z)

pay like, how do see an ADR being what you're forecasting

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:46:57.747Z)

Okay. So you so you're you you would normally occupancy and ADR would be what you're forecasting and and count

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:01.205Z)

and

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:05.457Z)

would be, like, the input, so to speak, in RevPAR. Is the calculate is the is an output as a calculation. You're dialing up or down the

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:11.225Z)

plan is? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:12.347Z)

of the concept based on what your strategic plan is.

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:12.765Z)

And it may know, five percent one year, 4% another, 7% another,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:15.327Z)

Yeah. It may be, you know, 5% in one year, 4% in another, seven in another. Right? So it could be variable.

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:16.725Z)

So it could be variable. Based on what you know, what is being done various parts of

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:21.417Z)

Based on what, you know, work is being done in various parts of the hotel.

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:21.905Z)

the hotel. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, you see penetration still in the parking lot. We haven't And it's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:26.117Z)

Yeah. And then let's not forget that sometimes we like to use multiple comp

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:32.535Z)

multiple comm sets.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:36.487Z)

sets. Well, yeah, I think in some maybe that's for later on, but I think Right. Typically, there's, like, a

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:43.155Z)

Free you

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:46.737Z)

you know, if you're looking at a hotel, it's repositioning.

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:47.175Z)

seven. Transition to a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:49.307Z)

The hotel would have a current set, but then post renovation, you would transition to a

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:52.925Z)

You know, And then you may have, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:47:54.157Z)

of post renovation and more aspirational set. Yeah. And then you may have seen the aspirational set a and aspirational set b.

### You (2025-06-16T19:47:58.165Z)

know, it's complicated. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:01.427Z)

You know, it just gets complicated. But, Mark, we for the proof of concept,

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:04.835Z)

Proof concept, then we can add it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:06.477Z)

are were we okay just to have one? Right? And because it's just

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:09.555Z)

Yeah. I mean, listen. We don't it's always, know, we've come so far. I mean, yes,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:09.557Z)

the proof of concept, and then we can add it Yeah. I mean, listen. You know, there's only you know, we've come so far. I mean, yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:14.815Z)

I think that we have on the version. Too for a trader. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:17.467Z)

To answer your question. I think that could be an add on a version two or three. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:17.905Z)

So right now, I'm only using the historical data. That was in there. I don't have any, obviously, for forecast data. So we'll have to on Howard, compromise. This. Just in the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:34.577Z)

Yeah. You know, Howard, maybe one compromise is

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:34.815Z)

in the input section. Mhmm. Just say,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:37.367Z)

just in the in the input section.

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:37.545Z)

you know, both sets two or three. Just leave it blank, but just to show

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:39.707Z)

Just say, you know, propose sets two and three and just leave it blank

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:40.675Z)

user you know, the the tester that that we

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:43.447Z)

but just to show the user

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:44.035Z)

envision.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:44.877Z)

you know, the the the tester that that we envision building this out later.

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:45.135Z)

But just been able to do it yet. So at least, like, see it. We thought about it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:49.787Z)

We just haven't been able to do it yet. So at least I could see that we've thought about it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:48:49.905Z)

For the future. Versions. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:48:53.617Z)

For future versions.

### You (2025-06-16T19:49:00.155Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:49:07.107Z)

But a big coming soon sign on it.

### You (2025-06-16T19:49:08.285Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that that's not difficult to do. I mean, can just have two different datasets coming in. You know, I I can foresee saying you know, having a little drop down box says, you know, what year renovation. If it's year three, then in that case, that would be, you know, 02/20/2027. Could switch over to comparison to the other one. I mean, it's from from a technical standpoint, it's it's not difficult to do. It's just one of the things that we really haven't talked about yet is where any of this external third party data is going to come from and how we get it in here. Everything that I've done to this point is really focused on these yellow shaded lines. The forecasting. How do I, as a forecast the data. Based on what I have now. Right? So so we still have some work to do. On on that. The market data is

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:17.267Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:17.575Z)

collusion.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:19.617Z)

Market data, we should be able to get, like, I I provided one couple weeks ago that has LARC forecast data, right, for for all the top 50 markets. CBRE data is easy to get as well. They have an extract you download from the CBRE portal, and it has the top

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:31.385Z)

As

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:37.187Z)

85, 90, whatever markets for same same sort of setup as it does at Lark has.

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:42.515Z)

something

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:42.977Z)

That that data, I think we

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:44.295Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:45.197Z)

assume will be something we get

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:48.545Z)

You know, as well as the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:48.597Z)

for historically as well as

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:51.565Z)

Yeah. It's probably the only

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:52.437Z)

you know, as well as a forecast from them as well, which

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:52.885Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:55.617Z)

is probably the only

### You (2025-06-16T19:50:56.355Z)

My whole, you know, five year

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:50:57.027Z)

forecast that will be provided, like, you know, five year know, outlook that will be provided. Everything else will be an input.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:01.185Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:04.757Z)

And then, Drew, in your database where you're

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:08.175Z)

For

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:09.157Z)

capturing the the star info,

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:09.215Z)

you able to direct send that to Howard? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:12.697Z)

you able to directly then send that to Vinod and Howard? Like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:14.635Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:17.437Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:18.195Z)

Yeah. That's much more

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:18.507Z)

Yeah. We did. We did. I did send them a bunch. You did.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:19.485Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:21.067Z)

Okay. Can send, yeah, send a bunch more.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:21.405Z)

That would be something actually be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:23.287Z)

And I think eventually, that would be something that fit that that a user would just upload an STR report. And the system gets told the data from the SDR report without so you wouldn't necessarily need

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:33.215Z)

pretty specific thing that So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:35.357Z)

need us because that's a that's a pretty consistent

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:37.225Z)

And how are you?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:38.067Z)

dataset. As chairman reports. And, Howard, that would be that

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:43.515Z)

Something maybe similar

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:45.297Z)

thumbnail you showed us. Right? There would be something maybe similar.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:45.575Z)

I think you're talking about because I'm gonna talk to Jimmy or

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:51:49.187Z)

You I think you were talking about because when I talked to James, and James at CBRE was personally modeling a 45 room or forty seven forty five or 47 hotel portfolio.

### You (2025-06-16T19:51:57.605Z)

hotel portfolio. Yeah. And he had it all the things So he asked

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:04.117Z)

And he had to input all that data himself.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:05.375Z)

play for to drop? These files?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:07.377Z)

He asked the question, is there a place where I could just drop

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:07.455Z)

And grab them to populate online model.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:10.397Z)

these files and you can grab them to populate the online model?

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:11.795Z)

And I know that our long term objective is to get it all going through Drew so that we're

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:15.337Z)

And I know that's our long term objective is to

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:16.985Z)

really totally digitized

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:18.357Z)

get it all going through Drew so that we're really totally digitizing this

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:18.775Z)

this. But it better off. In a in a in a version.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:23.147Z)

But in the interim,

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:23.505Z)

Two.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:25.247Z)

in a in a in a version two, there would be the ability to drop

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:25.475Z)

The star which as you mentioned, is a consistent format for our referral hotel to be able to

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:29.327Z)

the star report, which, as Drew mentioned, is in a consistent format for every single hotel

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:31.385Z)

pull up. Right. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:34.297Z)

to be able to pull up.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:34.875Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:35.957Z)

Right? Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:36.845Z)

So here here's a question.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:37.257Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:39.855Z)

If somebody is underwriting a portfolio do they do a separate model for each individual hotel? And then roll that out?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:50.797Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:51.305Z)

Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So that is going to be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:55.357Z)

Yes. They do. Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:57.065Z)

something that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:52:57.417Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T19:52:59.665Z)

that yeah. We we can certainly we can certainly do that. RedIQ did not have that capability, but it was, like, the number one question request that clients had. But the way it was built originally, kind of basically made that almost impossible to do. But that's that's because of the the original setup. If we and and, basically, the the hotel industry kinda has already overcome the main hurdle for that by having everything standardized. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:53:35.207Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:53:35.655Z)

we would have this model is is what everybody's gonna use. I don't care whether it's, you know, casino resort or if it's a little Motel six. Right? They can all use the same model, which means every road

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:53:48.137Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:53:50.045Z)

here is gonna be consistent.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:53:51.747Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:53:52.305Z)

So yeah, what we would have then is we would on what the note is working on with with when you have your deal list. Right? You'd have 42 properties. You just check a box, which ones you wanna have.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:03.137Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:05.385Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:05.897Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:06.205Z)

you can just you can make unlimited comparisons. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:09.567Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:10.475Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That's good news. Growing out. Need another truck that we we see over it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:14.507Z)

And that would be huge. Good point, Howard. We need another drop down for casino revenue.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:14.735Z)

We it. That was another seen That

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:18.737Z)

What? And That was a joke. That was a joke.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:27.975Z)

modeled or I'm I'm

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:28.517Z)

The portfolio thing, like, as as someone who's model of poor

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:29.555Z)

fortunate have the management acquisition of portfolios, and it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:32.677Z)

I've I've worked in asset management and acquisition on portfolios, and it's

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:32.995Z)

such a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:36.777Z)

such a stressful thing to roll up all those assets

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:39.315Z)

you have macros. Yeah. So I that's

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:41.627Z)

over and over again even if you have macros.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:41.985Z)

that will be self. Point for you.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:54:44.567Z)

So I that that will be a huge selling point for us if we we can do that.

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:44.795Z)

We can do that. Yeah. Alright.

Before I one more thing, just a funny story. Before I left CBRE,

### You (2025-06-16T19:54:57.445Z)

Two of the select service brokers

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:00.857Z)

two of the main select service brokers Al Calhoun and Mark Fair, they were

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:01.705Z)

Al Palvin, and Mark Fair. They were under Mike or they were taking were flight like, really hard portfolio. And the analyst was literally, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:09.027Z)

underwriting or they were taking out, like, a really large select service portfolio.

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:12.195Z)

computer was going up and feed those from all the modeling he was doing on the right. But I

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:13.757Z)

And their analyst was literally like, his computer was going up in fumes from all the modeling he was doing on it. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:19.385Z)

them in the office, and they had the the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:20.127Z)

But I distinctly remembering walking past them in the office

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:21.735Z)

big white binders, like three rings.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:24.377Z)

and they had the these big white binders, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:25.055Z)

Binders, they ever had the print out all of the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:28.207Z)

three ring binders, where the analyst had to print out

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:29.545Z)

information from the models and they were showing through the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:32.117Z)

all of the information from the models, and they were going through the binders.

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:32.355Z)

binders. And I just much my much opportunity

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:37.027Z)

And I just thought to myself,

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:38.025Z)

Definitely.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:38.727Z)

oh my god. There's so much opportunity here to, like, digitize this

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:39.435Z)

This. Process. Oh. Yeah. I believe it's real. Like, during Ring Finder.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:43.697Z)

process because

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:44.715Z)

Yeah. But the analog has to be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:45.007Z)

I couldn't believe the three white three ring binders

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:47.185Z)

print out, right, and put together. It was crazy.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:48.957Z)

that the analysts had to print out. Right? And

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:49.815Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I yeah. Thank you so much.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:51.977Z)

put together. It was crazy.

### You (2025-06-16T19:55:53.385Z)

For some of the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:55:54.157Z)

Yeah. I I didn't really see it. I I feel like portfolio, like, modeling portfolios or doing a portfolio of positions is they that will probably whoever's doing that, I mean, yeah,

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:05.005Z)

different properties for the SDR data.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:06.737Z)

thing you have James typing in 45 different

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:08.125Z)

Like, I mean, I that would probably be

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:10.227Z)

properties worth of STR data is, like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:11.675Z)

excited about.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:12.607Z)

I mean, that is

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:13.785Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:13.957Z)

will probably be they will be the most excited about this. Yes. Yep.

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:18.125Z)

In the last couple minutes, I had a blow that when I had to do this. It's just an idea, and I'm just

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:22.457Z)

In the last couple minutes, I just wanted to float, and I and

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:24.055Z)

putting it in the parking lot, I guess, of our ideas.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:26.167Z)

this is just an idea, and I'm just putting it parking lot, I guess.

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:27.375Z)

Yeah. Maybe in the past. And and it's clear that

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:30.807Z)

Of our ideas.

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:31.885Z)

itself cannot be patented.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:32.917Z)

In the past. And we've come

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:34.325Z)

Stone specialty can't

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:36.987Z)

and it's clear that software itself cannot be patent.

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:37.585Z)

be patented. But the one thing I I was thinking in the last two weeks, and it's because it's that whole real thing,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:41.697Z)

Some specialty LLMs can be patent.

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:44.015Z)

I'm dealing with.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:46.007Z)

But the one thing I I was thinking about over the last two weeks, and it's because

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:46.665Z)

We're working on two hotels and

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:49.957Z)

an actual real thing I'm dealing with, is

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:50.745Z)

Charles portfolio. One is is a West End at BWI and another is a high in

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:53.017Z)

we're we're working on two hotels in

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:56.385Z)

with a Camry. Suites that switched to a high temporarily

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:56:57.307Z)

Evans Charles portfolio. One is a Weston at BWI,

### You (2025-06-16T19:56:59.915Z)

going to a Hyatt place. And so we've had lots of conversations

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:02.277Z)

another is a high it was a Cambria Suites.

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:04.435Z)

recently, like, everyone's telling me,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:05.297Z)

That switched to a Hyatt temporarily, and it's going to a Hyatt place. And so we've had lots of conversations

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:06.725Z)

Diane, who is the what? Stick. At BW

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:11.337Z)

recently. Like, literally, Evan's telling me, Diane,

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:11.755Z)

one stick should outperform American behalf in a to

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:15.167Z)

this is a Weston at BWI,

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:16.215Z)

a share of it. Right? So we look at the number

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:18.967Z)

and a Weston should outperform a Marriott in a

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:19.185Z)

and then looking at, like, distance from the airport. Figure all this out.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:22.687Z)

should outperform a Sheridan. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:23.855Z)

The other hotel we saw that movie

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:25.567Z)

We look at the numbers, and then you're looking at, like, distance from the airport and trying to

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:26.195Z)

switched it from Cambria to Hyatt. Even on renovated

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:29.637Z)

figure all this out. The other hotel, we

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:30.515Z)

So we flip a switch and apply for renovations

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:32.987Z)

thought when we switched it from Cambria to Hyatt, even

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:33.645Z)

system would turn on. But the other part of the head space of the

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:36.937Z)

unrenovated, we'd flip a switch and, like, a reservation system would

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:37.255Z)

product just could not overcome the online reputations. So we now completely

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:41.697Z)

turn on, but the unrenovated state of the

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:42.655Z)

ready it. We're flipping the switch to Hyatt Place on July 2. So now why the couple of

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:45.047Z)

just could not overcome the online reputations. So we've now completely renovated, and we're flipping the switch

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:49.505Z)

the story it is I think we could

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:52.707Z)

to Hyatt Place on July 2.

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:52.775Z)

long term, like, say, like, a year or maybe twenty four months out,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:55.727Z)

So now why I tell both of those stories is

### You (2025-06-16T19:57:57.505Z)

Including our process, maybe something that helps us patent it

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:57:59.027Z)

I think we could long term, like, say, like, a year maybe twenty four months out, include in our process maybe something that helps

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:00.885Z)

around what is the value of the brand. What is the value that Marriott brings

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:07.557Z)

us patent this around what is the value of the brand. Like,

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:08.615Z)

over? Say, intercom or something like that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:12.527Z)

what is the value that

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:13.275Z)

Do for test

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:14.287Z)

Marriott brings over, say,

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:14.545Z)

prep.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:17.907Z)

Intercon or something like that. We're already doing it for tax appraisal work,

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:18.835Z)

Consultant will option go and argue the intangible value of the brand to get a discount on your

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:22.877Z)

Right? When you go your tax your tax

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:25.895Z)

real estate taxes.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:26.417Z)

consultant will often go and argue the intangible value of the brand

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:27.665Z)

So why you think we might have to be able to do this

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:31.387Z)

to get a discount on your real estate taxes. So

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:31.435Z)

is if we the right road

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:36.077Z)

why I think we might actually be able to do this is

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:36.375Z)

sources, they probably will have the brand contribution data.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:39.757Z)

if we have an API connection with the right revenue

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:41.215Z)

And you're not gonna be asking that question because you're maybe

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:44.037Z)

sources,

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:44.155Z)

closer to it than I am, but

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:45.127Z)

they probably will have the brand contribution data.

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:45.935Z)

if you started to look at what the brain true brand contribution data image,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:48.847Z)

Drew, I'm gonna maybe ask you that question because you're maybe closer to it than I am. But

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:50.685Z)

It's truly you can actually see

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:53.767Z)

if you started to look at what the brand true brand contribution data is,

### You (2025-06-16T19:58:54.315Z)

the access .com what there incidents in each

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:58:58.227Z)

the true maybe, like, you can maybe we can actually see through the x.com, like, what the variances and ADRs are.

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:00.185Z)

We might be able to use AI if we had enough data to think about what the value of a brand is

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:08.167Z)

We might be able to use AI over time if we had enough data

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:08.635Z)

in this mix. Yeah. But there's, a bunch of different there's a

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:12.387Z)

to think about what the value of a brand is in this mix.

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:15.945Z)

if you add up

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:17.267Z)

Yeah. There's actually a way there's a

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:17.295Z)

if you imagine you have, like, a cost to

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:19.777Z)

there's a form of statistical modeling where you basically

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:22.245Z)

over or maybe an identical hotel with a left and right

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:23.807Z)

if you have if you imagine you have, like, a

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:27.195Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:27.507Z)

cluster of hotels

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:28.165Z)

you think about all of those variables,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:29.907Z)

or or maybe an identical hotel, like a Weston branded hotel in a 100 markets

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:31.205Z)

location. Other

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:35.397Z)

and you think about all the variables that impact hotel performance.

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:36.765Z)

like, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:39.097Z)

Location, number of rooms, other, like, you know, like, meeting space, Like, right, like, if you there's a way to

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:48.905Z)

factors.

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:51.017Z)

run a model or statistical model that you typically normalize for all of the extraneous factors, And

### You (2025-06-16T19:59:58.205Z)

Actors,

### Guest (2025-06-16T19:59:58.267Z)

and the model will say that, like, I can't remember what it was called. With the form modeling is called. Basically, like, say, like, oh, if you normalize for all the factors,

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:06.195Z)

and how will that

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:06.617Z)

this hotel should be doing better. This hotel should be doing better.

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:11.845Z)

variable.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:12.597Z)

And give you, like, a kind of an apples to apples comparison across

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:13.375Z)

That's how we can have enough data, we can certainly do something like that, and I think that you could have

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:16.247Z)

you know, any dataset regardless of different variables.

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:19.635Z)

something like that with, like, adding to your assumptions.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:21.317Z)

That that way, if if we had enough data, we could certainly

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:24.565Z)

So I do go on.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:25.237Z)

something like that. And I think, yes, you could patent

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:25.675Z)

Of other things we can do too, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:27.417Z)

something like that, basically, like, patenting your assumptions.

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:28.295Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:30.247Z)

On Right.

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:31.415Z)

CapEx.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:31.547Z)

But yeah. So I think there's a lot of other things we could do too, like,

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:34.105Z)

You know, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:35.187Z)

like,

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:35.245Z)

what's the dollar what's the dollar return on

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:36.727Z)

you have enough data on on how much money is spent in CapEx and you could

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:38.985Z)

You know? $3 on epic? On average. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:41.097Z)

come up with you know, like,

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:42.645Z)

I'm I don't personally look

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:43.217Z)

what's the dollar what's the dollar return

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:44.095Z)

school for some on that. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:46.267Z)

on, you know, every dollar of CapEx spend

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:46.435Z)

Like, we're gonna do it on other rules you know, the stuff like

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:49.127Z)

on average. Right? Like, I don't

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:49.785Z)

know, putting a rate on something that's going to be you know, occupancy and rate.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:51.067Z)

don't personally know of any rule of thumb on that. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:53.825Z)

Great. That's how they feel like it's pretty

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:54.287Z)

Like, Right. I know of, like, other rule of rules of thumb, like,

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:55.905Z)

well known. But there are tons of others Right. Other things that we

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:00:57.887Z)

you know, putting a brand on something is good more likely to drive occupancy than rate.

### You (2025-06-16T20:00:59.245Z)

help with. As and I don't think that's really.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:01.967Z)

Great. That now when I feel like it's pretty well known, but there's tons of others

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:05.295Z)

Properly market them,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:05.967Z)

Right. Other things that we could come up with as

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:06.995Z)

they become value added in

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:08.687Z)

our own. And I don't even necessarily need to patent them, but if you if you come up with them and you

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:09.445Z)

to a brand. Which can then trade market. And and

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:13.787Z)

properly market them,

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:13.855Z)

and similar to what

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:15.217Z)

they become value additive to a brand.

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:16.585Z)

you said to our

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:19.327Z)

Which can then be trademarked. And and and

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:21.655Z)

use us as something piece synonymous for other sources

similar to similar to how everybody uses STR,

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:24.725Z)

you know, to

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:25.797Z)

as a sort of synonymous for benchmarking,

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:26.395Z)

from the underwriting. Right. Because Mark has pointed out, and then

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:28.007Z)

Right. You you know, use us use us as something to be synonymous for other sorts of

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:30.845Z)

it's a really good point that it be

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:32.867Z)

you know, key rules of thumb for underwriting.

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:33.165Z)

also would adjust least get on the pad and

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:36.057Z)

Right. Because Mark has pointed out, and it and it's a really good

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:36.235Z)

like, request it and, like, be able to say, like, patent pending or something like that on this product.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:39.917Z)

point, that it would be awesome if we could just at least get a patent

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:42.125Z)

But on pure soft software, can't do that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:44.317Z)

like, request in and, like, be able to say, like, patent pending or something like that.

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:45.065Z)

Right? On an LL, I mean, it's very specific very specific

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:49.257Z)

On this product. But on pure software, you can't do that. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:49.635Z)

to a very specific industry. The research I've done says, it is potentially patentable. But then when you take all of these things that

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:54.037Z)

On an LLM that's very specific, very specific to a very specific industry,

### You (2025-06-16T20:01:58.265Z)

hotel industry has that with multifamily doesn't have, right, and branding has

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:01:59.937Z)

the research I've done says it is potentially patentable.

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:02.375Z)

probably one of the bigger things that

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:04.007Z)

But then when you take all these things that the hotel industry

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:05.165Z)

maybe we could somehow get a request or get a patent, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:07.117Z)

has that, like, multifamily doesn't have, right, and branding is

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:09.925Z)

submitted while we're working on it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:10.527Z)

probably one of the bigger things. Then

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:12.195Z)

That we can say that we have a patent pending on on some of our work.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:13.607Z)

maybe we could somehow get a request or get a patent, like,

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:16.045Z)

Okay. So that we can we patent our our

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:17.947Z)

submitted while we're working on it so that we can say that we have a patent pending on

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:19.115Z)

display page? That's a trade Trademark. I just

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:22.887Z)

on some of our work. Can we can we can we patent our our

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:23.835Z)

something that has some level of like, Howard, that screen that we just spent

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:27.267Z)

display page?

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:27.735Z)

know, an hour on. Yeah. And the fact that you can

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:28.687Z)

That's a trademark.

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:30.265Z)

play with individual assumptions, but see real time what the impact is on either off or

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:30.457Z)

Or a trademark. It's just some something that has some level of like, Howard, that screen that we just spent, you know, an hour on,

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:35.415Z)

multiple like, just that that screen, if you go back to it for that, like, for the one we just saw. Yeah. Like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:37.097Z)

and the fact that you can play with individual assumptions but see real time what the impact is on IRR and multiple and

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:41.115Z)

that display is something that I've always wanted

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:44.707Z)

like, just that that screen, if you can go back to it for a minute, like, what the one we just done.

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:45.115Z)

to have. You know, it's just it's so if you could just change your points.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:49.027Z)

Like, that display

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:49.265Z)

And see time what the impact is on returns, I think that page is really

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:51.027Z)

is something that I've always wanted to have. You know, it's just it it's so if you could just change inputs,

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:54.295Z)

impactful. Yeah. It's gonna be a great tool for analysis.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:02:57.547Z)

and see in real time what the impact is on returns,

### You (2025-06-16T20:02:58.135Z)

Yep. And could we just have that format

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:00.467Z)

I think that page is is really impactful.

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:01.385Z)

or or that that that would look

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:03.367Z)

And is gonna be a great tool for

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:04.305Z)

Let me let me look into it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:05.457Z)

analysis.

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:05.815Z)

Because I think that when people

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:06.817Z)

Could could we just

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:07.335Z)

see that they could change

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:08.027Z)

patent that format or or that amount that level of

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:08.645Z)

you know, ADR or CapEx, or occupancy or food and beverage revenue, and it automatically calculates

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:14.567Z)

I think that when people see that they could change, you know, ADR or CapEx or

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:15.655Z)

the impact in IRR equity multiple and know, debt yield.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:19.227Z)

occupancy or food and beverage revenue, and it automatically calculates

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:19.805Z)

Which is all the benefits we did on top. Debt yield. But I had it to me that that's a

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:23.857Z)

the impact on IRR and equity multiple and

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:25.075Z)

incredibly valuable tool. Yeah. I I I know we can I've never seen anyone do that

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:26.817Z)

you know, debt yield. Which is one of the outputs we need on the top, debt yield. But

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:29.445Z)

Yeah. I I know I know that we can trademark our logo

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:31.637Z)

I don't know. To me, that that's an incredibly valuable tool.

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:33.005Z)

and things like that. I think if we

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:34.577Z)

And I've never seen anyone do that before.

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:35.705Z)

do something unique with that, to make it something other than just a basic dashboard. I mean, everything everything I've shown you, I've done previously. So and and so have probably 10,000 other people. Oh, I think it exists in the hotel world. You live in hotel hotel. Yeah. I'm over a decade behind. Right. But but the the thing is some new credit.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:03:56.917Z)

Well, I don't think it exists in the hotel world.

### You (2025-06-16T20:03:59.305Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We have to make it unique. And so, yeah, I think if we have we can we can certainly

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:01.497Z)

You know, hotels are typically a couple of decades behind.

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:04.275Z)

trademark names, logos, and if we integrate that into

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:04.487Z)

You're not you're not giving yourself enough credit.

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:08.965Z)

what we are working on, we probably can, but I'm going to have to do some research on to find out what exactly qualifies But, yeah, I I I mean, that's exactly what we really wanna do. It's a great help PayTrack. It really again, I've never seen that, you know, sort of what summary page you know, something that's so concise.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:26.157Z)

It's it's a great output, Paige. I I really again, I've never seen

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:26.345Z)

Yeah. Yep. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:30.627Z)

that, you know, in sort of one summary page, you know, something that's so concise.

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:31.045Z)

Howard, you're the one the load right now. So so you. So much because this is a hard

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:37.727Z)

Okay. Howard, you're the one bearing the load.

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:38.225Z)

awful part of getting through each one of these sessions. One by one, I think once we get it to

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:41.737Z)

So I just so thank you so much because

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:43.595Z)

point where we're testing it, it will soon start to go much faster. Yeah. Yeah. But

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:45.447Z)

this is the hard, awful part of getting through each one of these sections one by one. But

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:48.255Z)

I would just I thought from all of us, we don't wanna thank you for all the hard work that you're putting in

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:50.267Z)

I think once we get to the point where we're testing it and things that this is gonna start to go much faster,

### You (2025-06-16T20:04:53.685Z)

Oh, my pleasure. Situation. Thank you, Miguel. I

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:55.977Z)

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:04:59.027Z)

### You (2025-06-16T20:05:01.445Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T20:05:42.727Z)

Some cases. That when you grew up in Hawaii? I didn't realize

### You (2025-06-16T20:05:44.315Z)

So
