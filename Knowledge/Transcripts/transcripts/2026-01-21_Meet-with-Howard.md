### Guest (2026-01-21T20:30:38.057Z)

Hello.

### You (2026-01-21T20:30:39.842Z)

Hey. Good afternoon.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:30:41.737Z)

Just give me a moment. Let me just adjust my camera here.

### You (2026-01-21T20:30:59.922Z)

Four.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:01.897Z)

We are. Hello. Good. How are you?

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:08.802Z)

Michigan.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:09.897Z)

Where are you located? Michigan. Okay. I'm in vancouver in canada.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:15.602Z)

Where is the city? Okay, so you're on the west side.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:19.657Z)

Vancouver.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:20.082Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:21.897Z)

West coast. Yeah, just above Seattle, north of Seattle.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:25.362Z)

Places in Canada I haven't been to yet, and I hear it's beautiful.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:31.657Z)

Yeah, it is beautiful. When it's sunny, it's beautiful.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:33.602Z)

Yeah. Yes, that's what I hear. But you got the mountains, you got the ski areas nearby.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:36.777Z)

Wintertime awfully rains a lot.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:45.842Z)

And Ontario and really is around Michigan, but they haven't really been out west out there yet. So one of these days. Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:31:55.737Z)

It's a beautiful place.

### You (2026-01-21T20:31:58.082Z)

Is it just. I think, was it Steve?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:32:03.577Z)

No. Steve's supposed to join us. Give me a moment. Just ping him.

### You (2026-01-21T20:32:04.882Z)

No problem.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:32:35.337Z)

A message. Well, I guess this is just really getting to know each other. And I was just checking a LinkedIn profile. I see you worked with Drill Page.

### You (2026-01-21T20:32:45.922Z)

A few times.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:32:48.617Z)

One of my really close friends. It still works at RealPage. He's based in India.

### You (2026-01-21T20:32:53.122Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:32:54.697Z)

There's, like, a database architect. Interesting.

### You (2026-01-21T20:33:03.762Z)

First time was back in 2007, where I helped them develop their central reporting product, which was their first attempt at a consolidated. Reporting system. Rib age. If you're familiar with them at all, you know that they're very siloed. It's close to acquisition. So they have all these products with all of these separate databases, and we were putting together their original data warehouse and everything. That was very interesting. Love that position. Left after about a year and a half to join another company. And eventually in2017 I joined a company called National Water and Power that I was involved with utility billing and energy management for multifamily at the time. And ten days after I joined. They ended up buying. Mw. P.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:34:09.017Z)

Can't hear you. Guys. Give me a sec. Bear with me.

### You (2026-01-21T20:34:18.082Z)

So, long story short, I was back. With real page. And then they bought another company that I previously worked with. I couldn't get away from them for a very long time.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:34:36.297Z)

I actually had a similar circumstance. I did legal tech for a number of years. Like 13 years. And started working for a company. They were nationwide in Canada. And then the company split up. There was a part in east coast, there was a part in West Coast. And then I think after five, six years, My colleagues that I had back in the day were my colleagues again. I can hear you guys now. You guys hear me? Sorry about that. Microsoft just loves to change speakers. And issue with my. With my camera. Went. Csrs a little bit later.

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:21.362Z)

No problem. I'm in michigan. West michigan.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:35:25.577Z)

So where are you based, Howard?

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:28.402Z)

They're just on the north side of Grand Rapids.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:35:30.297Z)

Okay? O. Kay.

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:33.682Z)

Are you in Vancouver as well?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:35:33.897Z)

Cool. I'm an Aspen corado.

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:40.562Z)

Nice.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:35:43.017Z)

With the one year where there's no snow. I think it's the worst snow season for 40 plus years.

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:48.242Z)

Yeah. That's interesting. I lived in Highland Ranch for about a year. On the south side of Denver.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:35:56.217Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-21T20:35:58.562Z)

Back. 2001. That's where I was, in Towers.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:36:04.617Z)

Nice.

### You (2026-01-21T20:36:05.202Z)

Remember that quite vividly. I just joined this company. Like a month prior. And we don't get it there for this job. From dfw, and by April they had to shut down. It was a multifamily developer. And gmac was their primary. Venture partner. And they cut off all funding after 911 until things settled down. So wasn't there for very long. But then about two years later, I moved guy around the Springs and had family there. So spent a few years there.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:36:51.657Z)

Okay? Yeah. Actually, ironically, I was directly opposite the Twin Towers. Because I was actually working in Jersey City.

### You (2026-01-21T20:36:59.362Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:37:03.017Z)

So there was actually a review. And I was actually up at the windows in the world.

### You (2026-01-21T20:37:05.362Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:37:07.977Z)

Two days before.

### You (2026-01-21T20:37:08.162Z)

Interesting. Very interesting.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:37:09.737Z)

So. Pretty scary. Definitely. So it's a rohit. Did you do my little intro of yourself? I haven't really talked a lot about me. We just really got on call just a moment before you did. I can talk a little bit about myself. So I think the conduit between Steve and I is John Francois, who we already talked to. Work with Steve a few years ago, and then I worked with John Fonsa. In a company called Lettuce. So that was the Prius Company. But Steve and I technical background and I was working as a director and then partly as VP as well with them. But yeah, my worldview is mostly tech aligned a number of years in different industries and I would say payment and prop tech is probably my favorite ones mentioned legal targeted number of years. In asset management, like managing funds and things like that. There's an opportunity for us to work together, and here we are discussing things.

### You (2026-01-21T20:38:32.882Z)

So what were your role models with lettuce?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:38:33.417Z)

And. Yeah, just planning out things.

### You (2026-01-21T20:38:37.122Z)

I don't know. When you. Joined them.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:38:42.617Z)

So I started as a director, and then I think there were like, five, four or five people developers working at that time. Four years that I was with Lettuce, the team grew to 25 developers, and we were outsourcing and offshoring at the same time. It was pretty interesting journey. I learned a lot. I got a bunch of I learned. Really? Aws, right? Like talking technical lingo. I learned AWS really let us everything about being cloud native lately been experimenting a lot with AI use of AI.

### You (2026-01-21T20:39:26.322Z)

Up. Yeah. Yeah. And you work with prior to lettuce, or is that when you met him?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:39:32.537Z)

It's all relevant to what we're trying to do.

### You (2026-01-21T20:39:38.082Z)

I mentioned that. Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:39:44.937Z)

That's the first time. So Lettuce was the first time that I worked with him. Yet. But I think Steve worked long before. We worked on this company called Calypso. And I think Ken of us are 10 years. I think John for some maybe 8 years. So that one we grew pretty successfully to unicorn science. So I think when I joined us, maybe 20, 30 people against you. So we grew to kind of several hundred million revenue. NASDAQ ended up as your hedge fund actually end up buying it. They bought a regular component as well and then they sold it on as a package buy. Two things market it well. So they end up selling to NASDAQ for 10 billion. So they did pretty well by then. So I didn't benefit from that unfortunately.

### You (2026-01-21T20:40:36.722Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:40:41.017Z)

But. Yeah, but I've worked primarily fintech. Primarily 70% B to B can over 20, 30% B to C. And every stage of startup from the one prior to the last one I was in was basically a 0 to 1 similar to this one. It's basically I met the founder. We had the concept and we built it. It was a good roller coaster on the Russia book coming out. Next week, the Issue Partner with Forbes. Had a lot of pivots for mildly, like, we raised 40 million, 120 million valuation, various reasons. It went down to minus 10 million. So the 40 million was basically. BTC is a very expensive game. So they basically burned the 40 million in cash, 10 million more in venture debt.

### You (2026-01-21T20:41:25.362Z)

Y. Ep.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:41:37.017Z)

So it's still there. It was actually the first. It was actually for kind of families to save for their kids. So it's kind of a company called uns. So we did that one that was pretty interesting. It ended up getting bought by. It's all very incestuous, so bought by eventual capital. Company that my London partner so I have a sharing it by that. Means they end up funding. They bought it out of it didn't never form I went bankrupt. It just didn't have any cash, so technically bankruptcy. That will get resold. So they basically, it was fairly dramatic, as in, I think I grew the engineering team kind of. It's all Eastern European at that point. And at the end of it was literally I had 24 hour notice. The entire team needs to go here. So fairly dramatic stuff. There's no choice. Literally no money in the bank. Couldn't do anything. And then I think I went two months after that, there's no money for anybody. So that was a. Good one. A good, good one in terms of experience.

### You (2026-01-21T20:42:24.802Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:42:39.657Z)

It lowers and highs wherever. I've done various roles. VP Engineering director, engineering chief architect the last five or six years at sea level, which is another whole different game, which is pretty interesting. You got that one? I've been on a board a couple of times. It's just another interesting perspective. I don't. Have two. I think kind of there's some people join for us as lining up who are pretty good. The board we had was not the most useful board. My experience we'll see. And as Rohit said, it's computer science background but I've always been gull hybrid role. So you know the business really well, so kind of built scaled engineering teams here probably eight years. John Franco worked together, and we kept in touch quite a bit. Since. Since calypso.

### You (2026-01-21T20:43:34.162Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:43:34.937Z)

Enjoy the startup kind of good energy at this point especially, I think the certain things accelerate. The AI ones are in massive potential to do things very differently because I think it's been a very similar game plan the last 20, 30 years. You build, you scale, you've got an engine here, you need an engine team. Set them out of size, which means you sell, you need to raise a certain amount of money, as in substantial amount of money. So I think this one here, the metrics are all changing a lot. So you don't necessarily. We have to build this 20, 30 person engineering team with two years. And I think the, the speed at which it deliver is also getting much quicker as well.

### You (2026-01-21T20:44:14.322Z)

Absolutely.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:44:19.417Z)

It's an exciting time, I think. Yeah. The tools kind of again, it's. There's two sides, you know, that's kind of the. They can be. There's all the vibe coding. Just now you do. If you do it all and build everything in vibe coding and kind of a date, then somebody. Else can do it. You have to know about it entry so it doesn't help you. So I think the space that we are in with the ideas here, it's kind of AI is now meeting Enterprise, which is different. Like spending a proof of concept. We can do that. We should do that and use that to get feedback, I think really well. But we've gone to the Enterprise stuff. I think that's where I think Rohit's experience mind John Francois kind of. There's things you do there. Security wise, scalability wise. Which even with AI that doesn't go away. You still have to do that. Where's your data? Kind of. Where's the audit? The data secure and yeah, exactly how you play, how you leverage AI tools, and there's not really a game plan for it just now in terms of how do you use it with enterprise data, how do you keep that data safe? So it's very interesting time. I think we can definitely move much faster than any startup could do 12 months ago or 24 months ago. But bottom line, it needs, you know, solid business case, which I think is a joint for size. Building out. There's an industry there, and there's. There's room for, let's say, improvements. Yeah, it's kind of. There's. There's money sitting in the table. Things can be done much more efficiently. And I think, ultimately, as we engage with the business, that's what we think. It is. But ultimately, that's where product management is really important, is basically what does the market really want? We think is this. If we just deliver what we think and they don't want it, we just wasted a bunch of time. That's kind of high levels. My bank option from Scotland originally is I still have a slight accent, I guess. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-21T20:46:05.202Z)

I picked that off a little bit.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:46:09.337Z)

I? Yeah, yeah. I've been a US 30 years, so I was 15 years. So Scotland sold to Silicon Valley and then 15 years, Aspen. But, yeah, I've got some Scottish neighbors who are really hacked off because they've lost their exit, but there you go.

### You (2026-01-21T20:46:23.522Z)

Yeah y. Eah. Well, my wife, her family is very Irish. And we did one of those DNA tests a couple years ago, and mine came back as.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:46:32.217Z)

Good.

### You (2026-01-21T20:46:38.562Z)

Newborn england. Like, basically. Where? Ironman, Scotland, all that area. So I told her that I'm. I'm scottish. I don't have any Irish. Interesting.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:46:58.537Z)

Make it more fun. Yeah. Yeah, because that's basically Northumbria, which used to be Scottish, you're correct. But Irish and Scots are very. Because they're both Celtic. So Irish and Scott is a very. You know, they got on very well, and they're both Celtics.

### You (2026-01-21T20:47:12.402Z)

It also came up with the Scottish European. There was very small then. I had quite a bit of Norwegian, Nordic areas. So I tell everybody, you know, that's when I get my love of Viking.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:47:29.417Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-21T20:47:30.322Z)

Movies and single malt scotch. Right? So it's genetic.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:47:34.697Z)

Tr. Ue. Yeah, that probably makes. Makes sense. And the Vikings? The invader died on Scotland.

### You (2026-01-21T20:47:40.402Z)

They. Got wiped out.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:47:44.057Z)

Now. Yeah, exactly. I did. Those people can sell things to me. It's probably dangerous for you guys to know. Market things. I'll probably buy it. So I bought the DNA test as well. So what they had even I went to school. Basically it was Scottish. And in Scottish became Scottish about 800 AD. Yeah. And then there's all these things. Iridis horoscope. The Scots kind of repelled the Romans.

### You (2026-01-21T20:48:13.762Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:48:14.377Z)

Kind of 0 BC or something, which isn't true because there was no Scots at that point. Yeah. So there's a whole tribe prior to that called the Pictish. The assumption was we're all made extinct, but I did my DNA test and 10% of Scots are, so I'm actually pre Scottish and Scottish, which is pretty cool.

### You (2026-01-21T20:48:18.642Z)

Y. Eah. See, you can make claim to be one of the originals right there. The OG Scotsman. There. You mentioned we worked with East European development team, a world based.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:48:49.737Z)

So this kind of. So the book is coming out. Will tell you just that. Opium. You might expect the odd maybe one Black Swan event. This one. We have three or four Black Swan events. The book will go through all the details. One was where the team was located. So the team was actually called Distillery. Which I may have influenced. I did choose them, but not just because of the names of story. So technically, they're headquartered in Santa Monica, but the whole team is based in Russia. Which became a big problem because in the middle of startup, They invaded Ukraine. We weren't allowed any develop in Russia. So we had to. We spent two, three months relocating them and all their families. So we ended up being, I think, two locations, us and Russia, to tail locations. So I went to Turkey, some to Slovenia, coupled to Poland, coupled to Georgia.

### You (2026-01-21T20:49:47.922Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:49:51.097Z)

So that was on a Black Swan event. So we need to live in bedded developers, literally, legally, particularly in the finance one. You get cannabis suit. Russia, which was a very good, kind of really good workers. I've done teams in India, kind of Vietnam, South America, more so as well. The Russian ones are, you know, good, talented.

### You (2026-01-21T20:50:17.122Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:50:19.017Z)

So it was good. I find, like, they pay special attention to making sure things are done correctly. They're really good in. They have a good eye. They're very serious with their code. A lot of mathematical backgrounds. So they're very serious. Because we did. The Indian one was good as well. Any of them good? They're fast, but they tend to be also more wild. Is what I found in terms of the. Because the Indian one space is there years experience and I've got that I get higher salary and move the Russian ones. We had that team through all that trauma the whole time. Until we caused even more trauma. Like the whole team after four years.

### You (2026-01-21T20:50:56.162Z)

Y. Eah. I was. I was just asking. The. The last company I worked with. The founder was from Kosovo, and he had a couple of family members that remained in that oversaw reengineering and development team. And I was really impressed with him. Like I said, they just really were very meticulous about the code. And they did a very good job.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:51:31.257Z)

Another really good. And even we had one, I think two were still actually in Ukraine in one little. And if we said, you don't have to do this, but he's like, it made him stay safe. And he would literally just jump in out of bomb shelters. I need to jump out and do coding to keep. Her sanity. But luckily he was just jumping between bomb shelter.

### You (2026-01-21T20:51:48.002Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:51:51.097Z)

S. But. Yeah, no, that's good. It's a good team. And that's what. Yeah, I've worked with a lot of global teams.

### You (2026-01-21T20:51:59.602Z)

Well, I can give you a little bit about my background. It's fairly simple. I've been in commercial real estate, specifically the multifamily space, my entire career. Started off actually in the milk and family operations and asset management side. So really started off renting apartments and managing apartment communities. And then I had an opportunity, my wife had an opportunity to get a PhD in a university that's north of Dallas. And so when we moved down there, that's when I transitioned over to the actual asset management side. And I had my degree in finance and economics, and that kind of seemed to. Work really well with my background of. So that's why I got more involved on the acquisition. Some renovations and dispositions. And overseeing the management companies that ran the properties. But during that time, I kind of. Gained a reputation of being a very analytical, numbers oriented person. And so I really kind of. Focus mostly on the financial reporting and forecasting, budgeting. So during that time, I became vice president of asset management for a company called BH Management, that at the time, they were, I think, the 24, 23rd largest in the US. Now. I don't. I don't know if they've cracked the top 10, but they're up there. Very, very large company. And then I also work for data partners who typically around that top 20, top. 25. Investors. And Bellpardos is really. My. My entire focus was on cash forecasting. Where? I came up with a process of. A 90 day rolling forecast instead of the annual budgets. Because I've always said, especially a company like that, they actually started their budgeting process in early summer, June and July. And at that point, you're trying to go out to December of the following year, 18 months. It's like, that's, that's ridiculous. Nobody can look that far in advance with any accuracy. So basically, I was very, very strong in Excel, you know, VBA and everything. I was able to come up with a program that ingested a lot of information that we would want. Right, Your lease explorations, your metals. Your marketing and traffic all of these things forward looking. And, you know, going up to 90 days out. We basically kept that rolling for Gascoigne. At that time. Also I was stubborn before you joined about real page. Where in between those two roles, I worked for Real Page. Where we put together their original, what they call central reporting, which was their first aggregated database. And the real gauge business models growth through acquisition. They don't originate any of their products. And when they purchased them, quite often they remain a business unit, their own PNL center. So everything was very siloed. And to get data from all these places was a huge undertaking. But that's really where I kind of got bit by the tech bug. Working with them because. People with fcs. Oh, when does an asset manager do well? I sit over and I watch the paint dryer on the walls, literally. It's always great to look at the before and the after when you're doing a renovation, but that period in between can just be murder. Just saying that you already started looking into product management and at that time with Rampage, while we developed that product, Really kind of got me going. And since 2011, I've been in the prop tech product management space. So for 15 years now. I was in through a page again. I was originally, before you joined that I was with a company called National Water in Power, which is. A multifamily utility management and billing that I joined on February 4th. Still, on February 10th, they were purchased on the page. So. And in the meantime, they bumped the company that I was with prior to NWP rights. So they just kept buying the companies I used to work for. But my role was taking all of.

### Guest (2026-01-21T20:57:00.937Z)

Oh, interesting.

### You (2026-01-21T20:57:09.602Z)

These different companies, they were all competitors. And so they were all in the same place. They were just buying it for, you know, the clients, more or less. But, you know, they all had their own platforms, so there I was really overseeing bringing all these different platforms. Since I'm already familiar with them, merging them into, you know, a single platform. Rather than having four different utility billing processes in place. And then that's really where I got my product management background was in the utility and product management space. In 2021, I had an opportunity and you joined a company called rediq. In what IQ is the largest multifamily investment valuation tool. In the country right now. Using my brokers and investors, basically ingesting the wetland's financial statements. Extracting out of that, minimalizing it, putting it into a standardized format and allowing people to use that data to come up with an evaluations. One of the things that jumped out of me right off the bat was that all of the data that they use for. Underwriting. And acquisition of the same things that I, as an asset manager, used during the life of the product. So I started off then. Working on what we call the asset management suite. Because up until then, it was strictly acquisitions. Right? So if I'm a client. And I'm trying to buy property. I would use it from the 60s, 80s or six months, whatever it takes to buy that property. Whether I bought it or somebody else bought it. At the time that property closed, I had no use for Rediq until the next deal comes along. So it had a very limited lifespan. So we were able to create this asset management suite, which then, you know, Have, the clients could stick around for the properties that they already owned. And if you really do an acquisition, you are forecasting out three, five, ten years. But the fundamental signs are still basically the same. But instead of looking at that particular properties that will everything which you need to know what is its name in order to come up with evaluation. At that time. Then we started to ingest more macro regional level data so we could tell, you know. What is trending here? What are the rent going? So as part of that tool, We created also a profile versus budget or performance versus actual tool. Which any financial system out there will do. Natural versus logic. That's something about what most people do as investors, especially if. You're an institutional owner. You've got hundreds of properties scheduled on the is. They don't have a way of comparing their performance to their original own rank perform. Er. So as part of that underwriting process, you're making assumptions for years out. And so if I'm three years into the investment, right. I want to look back and say, How am I doing? Am I on track to meet our goals? Right? Are we going to get the return? That's something we can call. So that is one of the very first things that I did working there and then recreating a few other. New products as well. They were sold. In on the list of 2024. To a company called Radix, and that's a lot of switching to the CEOs possible. It was a great opportunity. For. Both organizations. Because radix cox market data. And we needed that. Market data. But they didn't have the day to day operation. Data that we had, right? Unfortunately, the timing was terrible. They were involved with the class action lawsuit event Student page. I don't know if you would have familiar with that or not, but they've been involved in the class action lawsuit where they're loving the management tool is accused of price. And collusion between these other companies. So, long story short, he had to do a complete pivot on his product. He took all of the engineers and everybody that came with Oneiq. So Oneiq basically sat there, and all we were doing is keeping the lights on. We weren't able to continue moving forward. And because he had this team in Kosano that was one of the fraction of the world IQ team who were domestic. Basically in January of last year. A year ago. In five days. Come look to the ambulance. Basically not everybody from the Rediq side go with the exception of one engineer to keep the lights on and that's it. So over the past year I've been working with some other clients when there was another startup. They want to build a RedIQ type product for hotel investments. But. This is what I'm saying. Not going to. Founders that refuse to work with each other right now. So I think that's probably either on hold or probably dead in the water. But.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:03:34.697Z)

Yeah. That's really bad science. That's one of the things we're a lot like. Just an initial founding team. Is really critical if that doesn't work. You said yourself up to fail because always been strong opinions, which is fine. Strong robust debate. And that's healthy. So I think it's a big thing. We're trying to a composition. We get these different strengths. Because experience, you've got way beyond kind of. It's great because I think the. The way you sing is they are assets. And that's kind of where I think John Forsa is coming on as well. So Calypso. Is it handled any financial asset. In terms, it could be a swamp bond, commodity, whatever. So we had this one system that could manage any asset. And that would be from kind of settlement level, back office. It'll offer us risk management, projections, front office doing the deals. But the financial ones don't have the physicality other than commodities is different, but end of day, they're assets with cash. The property one, to me is really interesting. There's so much physicality in there. We do the derivatives or the options, whatever else, it's all virtual, they're complicated. And they're in play. You use these instruments to buy, to purchase some of these pieces. But I think viewing their assets, their lease is an asset. They kind of. And it's kind of, you know, there's much more things at play there as well. It's not as easy like the finance one. Black shows all the rest. Certain models. This is how you value an option. Real estate's because I. I do kind of. My experience of real estate is completely different in terms of. I do short term rentals, so I have that one that was interesting. I've done things like the. There's a home exchange thing, which is interesting. So basically, because then you're exchanging your assets. I've got an asset. I want to use somebody else's asset, and I don't want to pay much money. I've joined at least four or five of these different plays there. Including the last one, which I left in October, is kind of one of these plays, but they're definitely assets, for sure. So I think that's. Yeah. Even as you're going through just now all these modules. I was taking a note or I've never heard in the finance one. We know John Pro second and I could give you. Here's all the players in there because we know that Vertigo. So this one is. What is the ecosystem? There the fact there's market a providers finance one way of market data providers, but they're different and they're completely different. So everyone might have Bloomberg writers, whatever. This one here, who's a player in the commercial space, kind of, I think, really important to know that. The underwriting was different. That's interesting as well. Didn't really, because that. That doesn't really exist. In the fintech stuff that we built. That's different thing. It does work in when I'm one limited part of the VC and we're doing M&As and things and funding them even then they don't call underwriting, I guess. So that one's really interesting as well. So, you know, there's a pickler. A formalized underwriting service area. The more I can always looking at thinking architectural so I understand properties and every time people write them, I get the basics there. Yeah, but who are the other players involved? And then ultimately build that picture of how the. The currents. To me, it's all the same thing. What's the currency like? What are the players in place just now? Who's the winners, who's the losers? And then where are we? Going to play, and there's somewhere, potentially depending. On, we might decide what kind of competing with some sectors. Other ones we're partnering with. So exactly where the the servers of we decide we're end up building, where does it fit into this mix is is really interesting. So yeah, the more because even yeah, I'm going to go through these three sites you just gave because it's really interesting because again, It's really important to know what you don't know. I think so. It's kind of. And so I think. I think Roy's world is really hungry to learn. I think John Fraisal wrote that. More of the commercial rental space. So I'm furthest behind here. I don't like that. So I have to play catch up here. Building the enterprise, scalable stuff. I know that well, and I know other fintech stuff, and there's a lot of parallels in here. What we did, scaling this one up so John Frostana can leverage that, but I definitely got Gap there, which I need to fill in, so. Yeah. So even these names are rolling off very interesting to me.

### You (2026-01-21T21:08:28.002Z)

Yeah. It's interesting because it's one of these industries as well, where it's a huge industry. But it's very much concentrated. In a lot of the institutional investors. And back when I was in asset management and we were going to these conferences and trade shows, You see everybody that you saw the last year? But their business card is different. Right? They just went from here to. That happens a lot in most of these industries. The real bread and bugger are the small and the mid size companies where they don't have the bandwidth and the resources to go with some of these technologically type of products. And real estate and multifamily. Operations in general have always been lagging the rest of the world in terms of. Their technological expertise and adoption of these tools. So that's very interesting. I've seen a huge increase in adoption basically since the pandemic because they were forced to. They had to do some of these automated. Leasing program. S and all these different things that they have. So I always thought that was kind of the simple lining of the pandemic, is that it caused the real estate industry to leak forward. But even the two you are talking about building, it's probably something that's fairly common in a lot of different industries. And different products. But I have a call tonight, actually, with John Tomlinson, who was he just retired. Was the cfo for bell partners. So what? I kind of dick his brain? And see what his take is on this. But, yeah, I think there's a great opportunity. I just want to validate. Like you said back at the beginning of the conversation. Need to talk to some of these other players out there and see if. It's something that the market needs.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:10:54.857Z)

No, I think that's right. I think there is one. It's a big market. So where are you going? Mid size, small. Which tier of the market you going for? And it's definitely, as you said, I think the. The bigger players got more muscle. They build bigger systems. But so this one opens a market. People not have the opportunity before, so that could become interesting. And again, the speed at which you can build now is just different capabilities are going to be possible. And I just look at it. I know the finance ones generally. Generally. We were building Wall street systems, so they generally have got more money than anything else, so they're generally more bleeding edge. Like we were C before and also C. We were kind of so for the service before. And a lot of other interesting is I think medicine. I'm guessing what I'm seeing so far gotta look at the ones where you get players like yard and all the rest. They smell legacy to me. There's a lot of legacy crap hanging around you in most web, but that's an option for us, because these things are. You need to understand because these systems are just. They're not going to steer overnight. So you need to work with them. Yeah. Eventually they might get a plural. We're not aiming to replace a yard. But you're basically. How do you work with them? Because they all want to evolve. And I think a lot of people are just scared as well, because things are moving so fast, and if you don't move and innovate, especially now, even before you can get away with it. You're right. The Covid one kind of forced people to automate a bit more than they were doing.

### You (2026-01-21T21:11:52.802Z)

Oh, they are eight.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:12:29.097Z)

But even that is a fraction of what? Like now, things are moving. So much quicker. And it really is if you don't do it. People say wee bit in this product. Out and we can materially increase. And again it comes to the assets return on investment. We're significantly increasing that by reducing operational expenses. By using money. The setting of the table. Nobody invested. So we can basically deliver that other people are not doing that, just going to lose out because the money is just going to go to the bigger number, really. So your RO is 2%. You add this software, you double, triple. So it's nice, even 20% increase in ROIS material. I think the experience you've got is really useful because if you're looking at that, it comes down to the figures. It's an asset sitting there, and it's fascinating data there. I don't know the whole kind of. I guess I was thinking initially when we talked about this. You've got kind of suddenly you've got a bunch of properties and got renters. It's kind of understand the revenue coming in. Who's a good renter, who's a bad renter, what's the projections? But the whole kind of the fact that M and A stuff going on. When are you offloading something? When are you acquiring something? I wasn't even thinking about that. I don't know if frequent. That is like if we were in a mid tier one as it's whatever size of the market we're going for. Is it 90% of the business is managing your rentals. More efficiently is that we're a sweet spot is. And at this point, I think we're totally open. I don't know, maybe the M and A thing is much bigger than I think, because you've got a big portfolio there. Then you can analyze it, saying, yeah, you might want to get more properties around Austin because it's going well. You might want to offload ones that are like so because they're not going in a good direction for whatever reasons. But yeah, exactly how we contribute to the MNA process is I wasn't even figuring that in the mix, but by this point, we're a blank canvas, so we can consider anything. And some of us may be short term, some is long term. Roadmap.

### You (2026-01-21T21:14:38.322Z)

It's interesting. You mentioned about the legacy systems, and that's exactly what real Page and Yarg and some of those others are. Even real Page internally acknowledged that they have a reputation of being the jack of all trades, master of one. Both yardi and realpage. They're not cheap. They have a type of tool. That's for cash forecasting, and they can do a lot of it. But those smell good. Size. The peak of the bell curve. Is priced out in the market. They can't afford that. Their focus really is on the top 15, top 100 orders. The institutional players and the smaller companies like you mentioned. They can't afford that. And one thing I found also when I was working with another client was that a lot of these companies don't use the accounting. Part of Neil Page or Yardi, their series and QuickBooks. They're still using different party tools that they have to integrate already. It's not just plug and play. By any means for their financials, so that is a good opportunity.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:16:04.537Z)

And I think it's one of the sea changes happening because the one for Calypso Eclipso would be a multimillion dollar sale system. It's a long sales cycle, plus it's probably one plus million multi month integration to go live. And even clutch. We built that one 20 years ago. That's also legacy. Even though the nasdaq paid 10 billion for it. Is legacy. That's the legacy tech. It's before AI came. The fact we can now view it AI 12 months ago, 24 months ago, remained 20 years ago. You would build things so differently. The thing that kind of. There's people if you present the mult. I billion dollar range is a very restricted market. There's less and less people with that and it's very hard to get closer to years to get into that. But this one, again, you deliver quicker and I think the cost will be broaden the people who can get access to this. One. We like to use those startup position, democratize finance and it's the same thing at this point. You go the big boys with the special tool so they can take advantage of that, create their monopolies or price fixing to be a far they want to go as long as they don't get caught. They'll do whatever they want. I guess. But ultimately, this thing here starts to democratize it. So it's interesting. Exactly where is this market and I think the market will be different. So I think these enterprise. Dinosaurs, big ones, because saps or oracles area. And again, these tasks are still. They're not going any place soon and they're obviously trying to consult positions. But I think to be able to deliver functionality quickly. Kind of cost competitive. The key thing. It's got to fit into the ecosystem. And again, you pick your battles. So maybe just this piece here, you can start growing it over time. So it's good around to think just where the overall goal is. Increase roi. If it's main flows helps you increase roi. That's the mission. We settle on then it's going to be really interesting. From your experience. I just. Okay, so what's the top 10? Which are the top 10? We should. And it's not going to be this is the one that will increase it most, but it's really hard to do. So you have that balance. Basically this one we think we can deliver quicker than maybe increases eri kind of five times less than another one. But we can get to the market quicker, get something people's hands, build a relationship with the client.

### You (2026-01-21T21:18:47.682Z)

You mentioned something new about the investment side as well. One thing. The investors and the owners are familiar with. But a lot of the operators don't pay attention to the fact that a property's value is based off of net operating income. And whatever the return rate is. And so I always use an example that if you have a property where the average cap rate is, say, 5%. For every thousand dollars you can save, or $40,000 you can increase on the ride, the value of that Property will have $20,000. If you're looking at income level steps, you may not go in and say, hey, we can save you a million dollars. You don't have to. You can do incrementally let your properties can become so much more valueless.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:19:51.497Z)

Because that one fascinating. I've been looking at the last two, three years, just personally basically, potentially at some point doing 1,031 so I can avoid tax. So they go into a whole realm of looking through LoopNet cap rates, northern esterity in there, which is really interesting to me because basically it's a 5% cap rate. Then you look through the details and there's no investment in maintaining the building. So what's really the cap rate? This is a cap rate. It's 4%. But they're annually putting maintenance at servicing the air conditioning and all these mechanics. Because I know the finance one will be based on gate. What's the price of a stock? We know the market is a liquid market. The Capri one. My takeaway from that was quite, say, people making up, but kind of making up. There isn't a universal cap rate, which is fascinating because these are really huge assets. Then I guess you're making up the price. And the brokers care about one thing as well. As long as they can sell it. Generally, the bigger cap rate, you're more likely to sell it. Probably. I don't think they're held liable because this is how we calculate the cap rate. But anyway, I looked at the ones with the higher ones. Generally, just the first trick they do is there's no maintenance involved, really. You have this 50 year old building and you're not maintaining it, you tell me the cab rate 7%. No, it's not. That's not fascinating. So the whole asset thing is because these are huge assets and the finance, once again, different from what we did before because the finance was generally pre liquid. These are not liquid. It's amazing. There's just so much money in that market because I'm actually going to one tomorrow, actually. Which is this guy who Aspen's got very interesting people.

### You (2026-01-21T21:21:33.602Z)

Dog. Well, there. No, definitely not.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:21:51.417Z)

So this is a guy who just. He manages a billion in assets and commercial real estate. So I just noticed, actually this morning, so I'm going to see him tomorrow. Interesting guy because he. 's Regents. Some of the best hotels in Aspen. He's a big kind of fintech guy as well. So he actually created the Aspen Coin as a crypto token. So use that. I think it funded 10% of purchase of real estate. So he's a huge guy in terms of tokenization, which I am as well. Tokenization of real estate, because the tokenizing stocks just now, a whole bunch of stuff there. But tokenizing real estate is fascinating. Again, it's beyond what we. I don't think we're going to do that. Yeah. Keep focus and do something. Well, and there's enough opportunities there, but I think the market's going to evolve. I think crypto is going to disrupt financing in a good way.

### You (2026-01-21T21:22:37.762Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:22:50.137Z)

So that task can be interesting tomorrow. See that guy?

### You (2026-01-21T21:22:50.802Z)

So I totally forgot and I just had a pop up come up on my screen that my Google is limited to one hour. I didn't know if it were. I don't know if you guys can see that or not. If it was just in my view. But, yeah, I just want to make sure that we're aware that.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:23:08.857Z)

It popped up.

### You (2026-01-21T21:23:12.242Z)

We may just get cut off here, and I think about 10 minutes. With any other questions or what else do we want to discuss? Anything that you want to.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:23:25.337Z)

I don't know. I think for me, there's luck for me to learn on the business side of things. I've been pretty much heavily tech focused, and it was fairly quietly listening and keenly on the conversation that you guys were having. So it's an exciting opportunity. And john. Franz. It's cracked. That we need to make sure we have the right mix in the pot, if I can say that way. We can all lean on, each know. Just know each other's strengths. So that's really what we're looking for, right? My one's very simple. I just see everything as architecture. Everything. And not the physical architecture. So this one here, we're architecting a team is what it is. Team? How does it work together? And it's very difficult because architecture system is easier. I know how Kubernetes works. I heard it's. More deterministic, architecting people with personalities. That's always more challenging. Good architects of masochists. So it's good to have the problem, the bearer, but it's a huge opportunity. And the other thing is, we can pivot as well. We think it's this. We could be wrong. You're willing to kind of the speed at which you can try fail fast is just going to go and steroid that was always a good policy anyway but now you can feel because the field fast before is maybe it costs you two or three months to get something you could even present this. 1. We can spin up stuff so quickly. Quick enough, it looks good enough that people can interact with it. It's fascinating. I think the whole thing changes again. The whole traditional kind of.

### You (2026-01-21T21:25:06.722Z)

Do.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:25:28.777Z)

Even though the PM and architects and the engineers are working together is different. Before traditionally their PM out of spec iterate for a month, send it to engineering, they'll build the wrong thing and then whatever. So now it's going to be much more interactive, which is great. It's really good. You try. You're interacting with the clients so that interactivity anything you can do with much smaller team which is great as soon as you get I've done the managing the teams my resource management are necessary evil I'd rather avoid that if we don't have a team of 2030 to manage that's good. If we need it because we're doing so well revenue wise and we need to add headwinds to increase. There's a reason for it, but this one, I think an opportunity to operate different levels of speed with much lower resources is incredible. And it's going to shaping all the time. This is a game plan. AI Is innovating faster than anything I've seen. In good ways.

### You (2026-01-21T21:26:37.922Z)

It's comforting to hear me say that, actually, because of what I'm coming off of right now with the experience with this other startup I mentioned, the two co founders. Well, the reason for it is. One of the co founders. His role was primarily. Fundraising. And getting investors. But he refused to have a conversation with anybody until he had the perfect product. Right. And so you can see me as a product manager. You know whose side I was on. Not his. And that really blew things up because we need good funding. They needed to get the money. In. We had a couple of safe notes. Or minor amounts of money. But they just couldn't grasp that concept of a MVP and iterating and building on it. It was just none of them had software experience. They were all from the hotel industry. To hear the say. That's good. At least I don't have to deal with that situation. Again.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:27:48.937Z)

No, it's really important because all the private product one, it doesn't exist and two, the games change again. The speed iteration here is just beyond. So even if that was a thing, which has never has been, I've never seen it being done as you think. It's not naivety. They're coming from a. They don't know how to build this stuff.

### You (2026-01-21T21:27:49.042Z)

Yeah. Y. Es.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:28:10.697Z)

They really don't. But yeah, this one, not to see the opportunity is incredible because of all things that stare in your face, the fact that we can spin up MVPs and prototypes with amazing speed. Nobody can deny that. Now, once we got traction, then we know what it is, then there is reality of building proper enterprise. Scalability, which is Rohit's amazing.

### You (2026-01-21T21:28:18.002Z)

Y. Es. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:28:33.257Z)

All the stuff that we have to do. Asia data secure is a good skill. But again, no point doing that. There's no project. The pro is not there about making money.

### You (2026-01-21T21:28:44.082Z)

Y. Eah. Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:28:45.337Z)

And then build it scalable. It. Was there people on the line willing to pay us money. We'll make it skilled as we need to do.

### You (2026-01-21T21:28:52.402Z)

Well, I think. I think we've got a minute or two left. I'm just going to say, a pleasure sticking to both of you. You know, I'm personally very excited about the potential opportunity that we have here. If you have any other questions. Or anything else you know, just let me know.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:29:09.097Z)

I like lines.

### You (2026-01-21T21:29:10.482Z)

I've got my email. We can communicate. That way we can set up another call. Whatever.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:29:20.857Z)

Nothing is perfect. I'm just. These three gave me were really interesting by themselves. I'm going to dig through these and then have questions area because again, I need to build this in my head. This ecosystem is vertical. I need to get and don't as good as I want.

### You (2026-01-21T21:29:38.242Z)

Well, one thing I will do is after I run the conversation with John tonight, So give me some notes. Both of you. So you can kind of get a feel for your sake. I mean, he's been the multifamily. Then CFO for public REITs as well as non partners. It was private, so I'm sure I've seen pretty good insight as well.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:30:06.537Z)

Yeah, no, that'll be great. I think there's just some people just operating, kind of. There's so much experience. So if we can tap the right experience and get some guidance out, there's money to be made here for sure. It's great to speak to you.

### You (2026-01-21T21:30:23.762Z)

Okay? Thanks, guys. Have a good day.

### Guest (2026-01-21T21:30:25.017Z)

Likewise. Good talking to you. Bye. By. E.
