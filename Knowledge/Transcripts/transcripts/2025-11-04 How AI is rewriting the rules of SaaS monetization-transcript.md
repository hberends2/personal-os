# Transcript for: How AI is rewriting the rules of SaaS monetization

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:03:10.680Z)

Hi everyone. We're ready to get started. Thanks for joining us. Before we begin some quick housekeeping, this webinar is being recorded. A link will be sent to you afterwards. And if you have questions during the webinar, please drop them in the QA section in the sidebar and we'll save around 20 minutes at the end for questions. All right. And with that, let's kick it off. So today is Scott and Martin will be discussing how AI is rewriting the rules of SAS monetization. So we'll kick off on how that shift is happening. We'll go into the investor lens on get Martin's perspective on create monetization looks like and the patterns he's seeing across the market. From there, we'll talk about how AI companies can better define and capture value, turn pricing into a true operating model. And then we'll wrap up with some practical advice on how startups can scale it the right way. And with that, I'll hand it over to Scott to kick things off. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet everyone here. Super excited to welcome Martine on to the webinar. Martine has been on our board since, you know, for at least four or five years at this point and is one of the kind of key, I would say, like voices on how infra and AI are intersecting. In this current moment, and I think he has a ton of very interesting thoughts around pricing and investor in this moment. I think there's like a lot of very interesting kind of rabbit holes we can go down, and I look forward to going down them with him. But with that, maybe Martin do a quick intro for folks and then I'll jump into a little bit of a vignette on metronome, and then we can jump right into the conversation. Well, first off, that beautiful image is definitely pre Covid. I was probably 10 years ago. Pre startup, maybe free startup. So I appreciate you putting it up there, but things have evolved then, so. Hey, listen, I appreciate the time from everybody. So I'm Martine. I run the infrastructure funded Andreeson Horowitz. I did my PhD at Stanford and computer science in infra. I was networking. I started a company, and I was a portfolio founder for Andreessen Horowitz. So Ben Horowitz is actually on my board. We sold that to VMware. We were kind of the first unicorn exit coming out of the recession and infrastructure. So that was a billion dollar exit. And by the time I left VMware that year that I left, it was a billion dollar business. Billion dollars a year. And then I joined 10 years ago in Jason Horowitz to run the infrastructure fund. And so I've been here for 10 years. I sent out a bunch of boards, names that you probably know, fivetran, cursor, a lot of the big labs, and so I'm very excited to be here. Very cool. Awesome. Well, I'll do a quick intro about Metronome and then we'll jump straight into the conversation. So for those of you who don't know Metronome, we power essentially monetization infrastructure for some of the fastest growing AI native companies and also some very large enterprise SaaS businesses. Our core value roughly is we make it really easy to price and package however you want and make sure that you can get your AI products into market as quickly as possible while making sure that everything is exactly accurate behind the scenes. And I think the other key thing I will say before I turn it over to Martin for some questions is that one of the key things that we understand here at Metronome, and we believe very deeply, is that right now there's a lot of talk about usage based billing, outcome based billing, all these kind of billing models. But the reality is that the problem that billing represents is actually much deeper. It's actually much more of a workflow problem. It's much more of a customer experience problem. It's much more of, how do you architect a business around a monetization model rather than just like, okay, how do I actually make sure that my invoice looks correct at the end of the month? And so we built Metronome to kind of service.

### You (2025-11-04T19:06:49.880Z)

All of those names. And actually, that kind of takes the first question.

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:06:54.280Z)

From our TN one that I think is really I think you built nicer in the late 2000s, early 2010s and then you worked at VMware. I think everyone would say that AI is a wave. And I am curious how you view the monetization like where we are in the monetization journey of this AI wave.

### You (2025-11-04T19:06:56.680Z)

Interesting.

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:07:18.680Z)

I think one of the things that I would observe about social media is, like, Facebook, for a very long time, didn't make any money. It just ran at a loss. And so actually, where are we in the maturity curve of AI as an industry in terms of monetization, and how does it differ from prior generations? That you've seen. Ok. So it feels like every platform epoch, we have to think about kind of pricing and billing and how we value software. Right. And so when I started my company in infrastructure, we're still in the perpetual days, right? So you'd sell someone like software or a box and they pay you some money and then you'd leave. You got to come back in a couple of years and try and solve another box, and then hopefully you had a new, better box or whatever. From where we started this year. After I left, the industry had gone through kind of the SaaS revolution and going to recurring, and the view was like, we're going to deliver software, the service, and then we're going to build from recurring, and then you get all of the upgrades that you want from that. I had a number of learnings from those. One of those is these tend to be customer aligned. Like, you do this because it's actually better for these are better for the customer. But the second thing is you have to redo your entire business this way. Everything from go to market to sales comp to how you value features, too. I mean, like, it cuts through the entire business, and we actually come with an entire new playbook in order to deal with recurring. And I know that, you know, Scott, you were in the industry as well. I'd love to kind of hear your thoughts on that. But, you know, going forward, so I think we're having a similar shift now as we go from kind of traditional seat based recurring to usage based. There was kind of smatterings of that in infrastructure before. I'm an infrastructure guy like you think, kind of like cloud cloud credits. But now it's everything. And this one is much bigger, much faster and much more furious than the one before. And it just tends to be a lot more strategic because it's so closely bound to the actual usage and value that it gets. And so, again, we're having to rethink everything. I think we're in quite early days to your question. I actually think I mean, listen, in some ways, I feel like I'm talking to Fermi about physics. Like, you actually are one of the world's experts. And so I would really love for you to kind of dig in. And I love to kind of spring with the anecdotes that I see from the board for me to dig in and how you're seeing it, you know, the key considerations these companies should do. But I will say from my perspective as a board member, as an investor, you know, if we're in the AI space, a company is not considering usage based billing, you know, It's a conversation I will force very quickly because it is so fun, it is so fundamental to the business, and it is so strategic. Yeah, totally. Actually, I think you mentioned it, but before this, I worked at Dropbox, and in a way, I think Dropbox was one of the vanguard companies for this subscription business model. So I'll give a little bit of an anecdote and then turn the question on you. So one of the things that I observe very quickly is that our monetization model at Dropbox for the teams product scaled with a number of users and so like the number of people in your company, you're essentially biometric or how your monetization scale. What this led to is like wall to wall selling where you would basically try to get as fast as possible to distribute across as many different people kind of logging into the network of your Dropbox instance. And so one of the interesting observations of that business model was that we spent a lot of time reducing the friction for bringing in incremental user onto the platform, both in the web ui, but also support for every operating system and making sure that every operating system kind of continued through end of life. And so there's a lot of really great dropboxers who spent endless years making sure that every version of Windows was supported to the ninth degree, because that was how they monetized. So that was like the monetization model dictated the product strategy, and those two things were going to be tied. One of the interesting things, though, is how much a user used your product had nothing to do with monetization. It's like if a user stored a trillion gigabytes, or one gigabyte or zero, you actually made the exact same amount of money. In fact, your incentives were kind of weirdly perverse, where your cost scaled as the amount of data that is stored, but you recoup nothing. And so what that led to is this kind of. It's like there's a reason why Dropbox is famous for its virality and network essentially expansion. But also you could say the value no offense. True, if you're listening, hasn't really changed in the past 15 years for any one user in that product. And that's actually I think a good to me, that was like an object lesson in business model is destiny. And so I would love to hear your take on some of these more AI native companies and how that intersection between product strategy and business model is playing out in these companies that are based on top of these LLMs. I'd be super curious to hear you just reason through it on maybe take an example or an abstracted example But I would love to hear your thoughts on if you have an equivalent story for some of these AI native companies. Yeah. I think the thing that's so remarkable about changes the cost structure for the user. There's actually two ways. One, that's not, that's kind of not answering your question. The other one. They just answered questions. Well, that's not answering your question is I don't remember the history of the industry where you could take a company and actually pour money into it. It could make use of that money early on. Right. Like in the past, like, you'd pour money into a company, they'd hire a whole bunch of engineers, and then they would build something really complex and it wouldn't work. Right. But with AI, you could pour money into these companies and you train a model, and that model is incredibly useful. Right. And so in some ways, companies have become these receptacles of putting large amounts of money and that actually turned into revenue on the other side with small teams. So it's a very, very different construction.

### You (2025-11-04T19:12:24.120Z)

How. Much that.

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:13:01.240Z)

But then you look at the other side of that. So what are these models mean to users? And again, I don't remember the last time that we had a product that was so close to actual value creation. So my favorite example. Is image. So I'm not gonna talk to all of them. I'm gonna talk something else because it's so much easier to reason about, right? So let's say that I wanted to create a Pixar image of me, right, in the pre AI world. I don't know. I can't draw what I do. I go hire somebody. Listen, it takes them a week. Because they're backlogged. And then what? 100 bucks, let's say, right? So if you compare that to the inference cost. What's the inference cost? 1 100th of a penny. So you've got four orders of magnitude difference, right? So you have got this very clear dislocation between what you could be for and what you can do now with a model, right? And so, because you're bringing the marginal cost down so much, there's very direct value to the user. And this different pricing because you could use it for an hour and you can get four orders of magnitude more value, or you could use it for a week. I think necessarily the trade off there is actually the cogs end up increasing for these companies. Right. I mean, you've created kind of like a nuclear reactor that costs some amounts to run. And so on one hand, there's tremendous amount of value. On the other hand, it actually costs to run these things. And so it just kind of necessitates a different model, both so you can kind of align yourself with kind of the customer value, but also so you can make decisions. On how you run your business on, like, how much do you want to, like, optimize for margin, for distribution or things like that? And so it's just the symmetry between the value created versus the cost of service is so much different now than it was during this SaaS era. It's just really require these different business models. And that's why I think so many of these are going towards usage based. Yeah. Well, so actually, that kind of dovetails with. Because you mentioned cost. I have to ask the question. But sometimes people ask and they say, okay, like, you know, they look at, you know, I don't even know where they got this information, but they're basically like, this company is running at a loss. Like it's like a margin negative product. I guess you sit on the boards of some of the fastest growing companies in the history of the world. Talk to us a little bit about our behind the curtain. Like, what is actually like, you know, is that true? Is this stuff like revving cost negative and then or margin negative and talk a little bit about, like, that kind of meme and, like, why. You know, it either makes sense or stupid. Yeah. Okay, so. So before I was saying, like, listen, like, you have this kind of nuclear fusion that you've created that adds tremendous value, and so that it's just like a. It's like. A different set of primitives to work with as you build out your business, right? So you can, you can make all sorts of choices that you want, right? I will say. And so, so now, like, you know, people make different choices based on that. Sometimes they'll go for distribution, sometimes they'll go for, for margin. Unfortunately, we as an industry, every time that there is, you know, a technical epoch, we have this weird schadenfreude where we also like, oh, like these companies are margin negative or whatever. And we have that conversation without realizing that these are board level decisions where often they're quite intentional to do that and the great thing about user space building, and this is a knob that you can decide to turn up or down. Right. So let me just go ahead and talk through this. Bending of the guys. So I'm not gonna say any specific companies, but we're in all the largest AI companies. So many of these companies, if you segment the business and you're like, okay, I'm gonna look at just the enterprise revenue, or like, the enterprise and teams around you, they're actually. Beautiful margins, right? They're gross margin positive, normally not software margins, but let's say 30 to 50%. They're actually great examples of AI companies at scale that have been profitable from day one, that are hundreds of millions of revenue. So there's clearly proof points of very profitable. But there are other ones where if you segment it on like, let's say enterprise and teams across margin positive. But if you look at like, free plans and, you know, maybe pro plans or the TPM tier, it's negative. Or the entire thing blended pencils out to zero. And so. Okay, so what conclusion can we draw from that? Well, if you have a situation like that, I guarantee, because I'm in these conversations, the board was like, listen, what's more important to us is distribution. Not margins. And what's amazing about usage based billing, by the way, what's amazing about this epoch is like you actually have that level of granularity and control. Like you can view pricing very strategically. Much more than during the SAS days, by the way, because this stuff is just so useful it kind of solves retention problems. So you. You can't at the board and say, listen. We're going to kind of give away this many tokens or this much stuff over here. We're going to pencil out blended to zero over here. We've got great bards, and at any point in time, if we want, we can kind of go ahead and, like, limit the free tier and go to a margin positive. And so, again, you know, this is at this kind of silly, stupid meme that. Happens every epoch. I mean, I mean, listen, it happened during the dot com days when they actually weren't making any money. Here we are making any money. You know, it's being applied now, but like, the reality is it just really shows the flexibility that you have with these business models. Yeah. And I. I think what you said is really important. Again, I think it's like, I'll bring in a Dropbox analogy because I just know it so viscerally. We offered a free tier, okay. Like, that obviously cost us money, like, literally, definitionally. Right. And. And yet it was like, it's. Like, if you just looked at the free users, like this product doesn't make any money and yet the company was free cash flow positive for like, you know, 98% of its existence. And, and, and, and, and the reality is, is like the free tier in that case is surveying as like lead gen for companies that are actually getting super deep value from it and then scaling and oh by the way, like what a great lead gen mechanism it is like 100. How many companies have just like literally pissed away money on like marketing that doesn't do anything right, like, like having having come from the SAS era, let me tell you, like like, the most common discussion on the board is like, we have all these MQLs. That's great. You're beating your revenue. None of them are computing the SQL, so none of them are, like, actually converting to. To. To wins. Right? So there's this massive, massive disconnect between marketing. General demand gen and then lead gen and then closed. And you would spend millions every year on this because. Because the marketing was not aligned with actually product and product usage. It was a totally different motion. And here you actually have like this magic thing that you can give to people that actually draws them on the product journey from day zero. And so it's almost like the most efficient marketing budget that any company has ever had. And then you just make a decision to what extent. Like, you're like, okay, I'm going to, like, grow distribution versus I'm going to do conversions into sales. And so I just think, like, this kind of memetic view on Mars just doesn't understand. Exactly. And it's even more. It's like, you know, the other thing that's true is that when you capture these users like attention is zero sum. And so if you can get them on your free product, then basically you are training them on your model of the world and then getting them in your ecosystem. And so I think it's like, again, it's like, it's like, you know, turns out big business is doing hundreds of millions of dollars. You can find a cohort of users that are margin negative. Okay, cool. Great. Thank you for that. Useful information. I think, like, the reality is that, like, yeah, it's like these, these businesses are, like, printing cash on day one. So actually, that kind of leads me to an interesting question because, you know, I did a startup in the early 2010s, and it was like, you know, the company getting to 100 million. Was like this insane milestone that just no one ever got to. And you were just like, oh, my God, you're a God if you can do it. Okay, now, like, I mean, I still think it's very impressive achievement, but it's being achieved super fast. What is different about the founders in this moment? Such that they can handle this like, or, you know, like, there's, like, obviously the Internet has mature, but, like, yeah, let me, let me, let me work towards. So this is the right question, but let me work towards it with something that's very adjacent to what we were just talking about, which is so our view as investors is that AI actually solves the customer acquisition problem beautifully. But it doesn't necessarily solve the retention problem. Actually, it doesn't necessarily solve the defensibility problem. Right. And so, you know, you've kind of got this hack. That you can actually throw kind of pricing at to solve to get a bunch of users. But then there's this. This great question is like, okay, so how do you retain them? How do you say defensible and things like that? And that is very much an evolving playbook. Like I, you know, like right now it seems that as far as I can tell, These markets are so big and growing so fast that brand moats are actually taking effect. Meaning, like, it doesn't. Like, like, I don't open. AI may or may not be better than the others at, like, language, but it's the leader, because people know it, and my mom uses it, which is crazy, right? And, you know, Mid Journey, which never took on any VC funding, is still kind of the leader in image and everybody knows Cursor and is the leader in code. And so you've, you've got things like brand effects that are taking over to get these companies to scale. But then also these companies have to move to very much traditional modes. Right. Like, what are the traditional modes? Two sided marketplaces. Long tail integration modes, things like that. And so I think the dynamics we're seeing of the following, which is why this stuff gets so complicated. The first one, like we said, is you can throw money at the user acquisition problem, so you have these massive, like, really quick growth. And then you have a separate motion which is like, so how do you kind of retain those users once the brand goes away? Right? And so you see, like, a lot of kind of product work in order to do that. And then you have this third one is because now you've got this hack for customer acquisition, like, how do these teams actually, you know, keep the companies running while this is going on? And this is going to allude to something I said previously, which is like, there is a gift in all of another gifts. And all this AI is you could actually make very functional products with small teams. It's more of like, almost like a science project than an engineering project. Engineering is incredibly, incredibly hard to complicate. And so I think to scale. It's very hard to scale because it gets so complicated. And so I think we're at a point where the industry, where we understand the acquisition, we understand some of the defensibility part. Of that defensibility now is you have to go horizontal, which becomes a bit more of a product engineering. Problem. And I think that's kind of where we are. Like, if you even look at, like, OpenAI released Sora 2. 0, right? Recently. And if you actually look at it, was it the state of the art video model? Not really, but there was a lot of product features on it, and so I think now. Exactly. Where we are is like, we're. We're in the product phase. 4. Things like retention for things like verticalization, and I don't think we actually have a good answer, but I do know that right now these teams are forced to be more product teams than they had been in the past for exactly this. Reason. Yeah. So, okay, this is super interesting because, like, okay, like, I talked. I talked to a whole bunch of them, but I just wanted to make a point that, like, just because you've solved the customer acquisition problem does not mean you solve the defensibility retention problem. The companies are focused on that right now, and. That's kind of where we are right now. They like. Yes. And so actually now I'm super curious because in historic modes, you kind of are solving these problems kind of in parallel, like at. Sorry, it. At the same time. Right. And right now it's like. But you just, like, somehow got this, like, hundreds. Of millions of ARR. Overhang, which means to renew next year and didn't exist last year. And so what is like. And I know you're working with some of the like, like some of the founders. I've met a number of them and I. And I've worked with some of the people who they're now hiring as their lieutenants. And these are, like, the smartest of the smart people, like, just like the true, truly amazing humans. What are these companies doing differently in this phase? Because they're essentially compressing an entire company formation into, like, a freaking year. They're taking a decade and compressing. And, and so, like, how are these companies even doing this? Like, how are, how are people, how are founders running these businesses? Like what? Like, and obviously it's like an emergency. Let's be clear. It's total mayhem out there. Yes. So let me give a bit of analogy, which is before you kind of build this complex product and nobody would use it, you know, so then you've got. Then you're kind of like lost in the forest and you're kind of trying to find people to use it. And so, like, by the time people start using it, you have a fairly, like, mature R and D or in. Product org and this and that. Like, that was kind of like the standard path before now.

's.

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:25:45.560Z)

And so it's like, you know, like, this adage of, like, you're trying to, like, you know, fly the airplane while you're building it type thing. I mean, like, you know, this is such a cliche right now. It feels to me. It's like what you did is like you took an airplane kit and then you launched it into the air. Now you've got to build it before kind of it hits the ground. I mean, the saving grace is that AI Is so magic that you do have users to work with, and you can a b test your way into how you do it. Right. If you keep things together. Right? So. So the good news is, like, you know, we're talking about usage based billing. Like, you can act. You're so close to, like, the customer value that you can really follow. User behavior patterns to know what to build that like, you're not lost in the wood. It's more of kind of a strict execution problem, and I've found the teams that do the best here. Are very, very user focused, very, very usage focused, very customer focused. They build the obvious stuff because the customer acquisition problem has been solved. I mean, I think that's kind of what works the best. And then, you know, and then, listen, I don't think we've seen the end of this story now because you know, we've got a bunch of leaders that are now branching out to a number of products. And every time it seems to me that there's going to be competition, the market just grows in fragments again. And so I, I think the story to date has just been fragmentation, so it's mostly white space and. Until this market slows down. That's what we're going to see. And then the consolidation phase will look very different. Right. Let me just give you, like, just a, like a quick historical anecdote on this. Remember, OpenAI was the first to image right with Dolly, but they lost that right. And then they were the first code with copilot, really. And then, you know, now they're not to leave there. And then they were the first to video assault, and they're not the lead there, but, like, they're, they're the largest company by far with language. Right. And so the, the conclusion that I take away from this is, is these markets are so big, you can't focus on a whole bunch of them. You kind of focus on one and you win that one. And I think while that's happening, you're just going to continue to see the companies that execute the fastest that kind of win the white space. Win. And then when things slow down and consolidate, will have a very, very new phase where it's going to be much, much more about kind of defensibility, staking out the ground, like competitive dynamics, et cetera. Cool. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, I think that that general thesis of. It's like, you know, these spaces were all much bigger than any of us thought, or they're much more. Like. There's so much more multifaceted and. And obviously, one way of winning a space is with product, and the other is. Through business model and monetization. So how, how do you think? Like, when you're, when you're talking with a portfolio company, how are you like, who are the, who are the key people to help, like a founder or CEO reason through the like right way to turn that dial between, like, where should be distribution focused. We should be margin focused. Like, generally, like, how are you, like, what is the ideal setup in this mode? Knowing that, like, if you get it right, it's like catching lightning in a bottle in the flywheel. Just things. How are somebody set up against that? Yeah. Yeah. This is super interesting question. So I've always viewed that come to go to three stages. There's the product stage of sales stage and the operation stage. Right. And like, you can't kind of skip phases, and the leadership is going to kind of align to the phase. And historically, the product phase is just about the product CEO or the product founders and kind of R and D and execution and whatever. And then you get to the sales phase. And the sales phase is when, like, basically the business side kind of kicked in. And so, like, when I was in the sales phase for my company, when we were going from 10 million to a billion. You know, my, my closest business partner was the cfo and the reason was finance. And so the reason that was is because literally, like sales comp and marketing spend and going international had had a partners. Like that was like the heart of the business. And of course, when you go to operations, that's the case. So the biggest shift that I'm seeing, to answer your question, is finance is being pulled into the product phase. It is so interesting, right? Like, we've never seen this being like, what is someone in finance going to do with, like, you know, early on, but, like, while you're still building the product and finding product market part to fit. And the reality is, because you do have this knob towards add value so much more directly, and it so directly impacts the running of the company and things like the margins, like, you know, even things like, you know, like, do you, if you have like a new feature, like, do you incent this by like investing money in it by, like giving it away or not. And so, I mean, I am seeing finance being pulled much more strategically, much more. And how does this always been incredibly strategic for the business? But it was, it was always in these last two phases. It was in the sales phase and then the, the operations phase and. Now I'm seeing it in the product phase. And so listen, you have, you now you have product teams that are incredibly finance savvy. You know, you've got R and D teams that are incredibly finance savvy. I mean, I work with companies, no joke, where the engineers themselves have dashboards on how much it costs for what they're working on. Does that make sense? So even as part of rmb, like, kind of the building is going through it, and so I think just finances become much, much more strategic as a result of kind of this new. This new epoch. Do you think that, like, kind of. So it sounds like one way that companies are reacting is every. I actually love to hear your answer the question that I actually, so actually it's interesting. I, I, I actually strongly agree with, like, so one observation I've had is that, like, our engineering team, for instance, is like a lot more financially literate than anything ever was, that Dropbox, like, ever. Even at the, like, terminal phase of the company, you know, except for like, maybe the senior infra leader or something. And it's like. It's like. It's like they don't own a pnl, but they understand the pnl, like, in depth. And they're like, okay, this feature, you know, I actually literally just yesterday saw feature requests for one of our largest customers. And, like, an engineer was bringing, like, here's the cogs analysis of how it was going to take the future. And I talked to the PM and we think we can charge X. And I'm like, oh my God, like, what? This is coming from engineering, like, cool, like working as intended, I guess. Like that's. And I think it's exactly goes back to this idea that, like, when you're in a consumption business, like you're, you're just talking about. Value. And then you're talking about value splitting between you and the. In the. And the customer. But, like, everyone should be obsessed with value. Like, it's like if everyone's job to, like, be building value for your product, otherwise what are you doing with this company? And so engineering, it's like, it's like, actually very empowering, especially because, like, actually, math is like, very easily, like, it's like engineering brain works really well with thinking about, like, PNLs. So that's one observation. I think I'm. The other thing that I see is it's exactly what you're saying, like, the person who runs finance is they're extremely young. First of all, like, we're seeing, like, CFOs, who. I'm like, whoa. Like, you are like a CFO and you're legit, but you are way younger than, like, you know, like, the meme of a CEO CFO is like, is. Like, you're like this like 80 year old dude and you have white hair and you're like, you're the risk mitigator. And now. Exactly. And now it's like the exact opposite where it's like they're actually. They're like, they're like pushing the risk pedal. And they're smart about it and they have full control. But because their business model is like so tied to value, it's exactly. They're able to like, see through, actually. Oh. Because I control both sides. I don't just minute manage costs. I actually manage upside as well. I can identify here is this and so what you're seeing is this, like, compression of, like, in a Dropbox, we'd have, like, the strap fin or who's all about upside. And then the accounting org is all about minimizing downside. And now it's, like, compressed into one human, and that person's very generalist. They're generally very, like, mathematically inclined, but they look, they, you know, they don't. They don't. They're not the accountants anymore. They're not like, you know, they work. They outsource a lot of that stuff. And so, in a way, it's actually a much more interesting. Super strategic role. And it looks like. And. And so one of these things that I've observed just is that these people are like, I think at public companies, the CFO is always the right hand, and there's, like, a reason why the CFO frequently becomes the CEO. They're in the operation stage. Exactly. About, like. Like a few points now. Like, to me, it's actually the opposite now. It's like the CFO is like a mini CEO, and it's just like. It's like in the. In the. In the maybe the best possible sense, which is like the possibility space, and they're like, yes. They're managing risk, but they're really there to, like, see upside. But to put the finest point on this, I'm going to repeat myself. It is so important like this. I've been in this industry for a long time, 25 years, man. I've done two companies of my own. I've done over 200 investments. I've seen it all. I've never in my life been in like a five person company where you're talking like, about, like, like product design. Like, you haven't even started the product. Like, you're literally talking about, like, okay, what are we going to build? Who? Are we going to build it to? And a key pillar of that conversation. Is, is. Is pricing cogs in the finance. I mean, this is the closest we've ever been to delivering direct value and paying direct cogs. And so if it's not pulled way, way forward, you're probably not getting it to do that, that it warrants. I agree. And I think the, the, the kind of the, the company that taught me this lesson super viscerally was when I like, we embedded in Snowflake for a while and just like watch that team operate and they told this story that like, has never left my head. This is like 6 years ago at this point. And they were basically like, look, the truth is, at this company, engineering, it's like when they're thinking about shipping a feature, they're like, you know, at Dropbox, if you could ship a cost saving feature and just like, drop costs by 50% or whatever, you'd have shipped it yesterday. You're like, of course I'm just going to go book the win. But in these usage based businesses, the cost and the usage profiles are so deeply related. And so the engineering team, it's like, actually they have to deeply think about, okay, how does this, like, cost savings affect our top and our bottom line at the exact same time. And it's like when you have these, like, tied to value metrics. Like, yes, reducing query time against some database is, like, in theory, good, but if your monetization metric is too tightly tied to that thing, then it actually could be negative. And it's like, it's like it introduces these really interesting set of incentives. And so you realize that, like, if engineering can be tweaked in that way, like, think, like, think about sales, think about every other department. Now it's like, like Snowflake. You know, they have this saying, or they. At least they did, which was like, basically the contract. Negotiation starts when the contract is signed. They sign a $10 million contract. Now sales starts, because now you need to burn down that contract and actually make sure that, like, the, the. The product is actually getting used. And it's just like, NRR based, like, mindset around, like, it's like bookings. Who cares? It's, like, much more about, like, actually, like, making sure that it gets consumed. And that is such an alien concept for people who kind of came up during the SaaS, where, like, vaporware sales is, like, just as good as sales software that actually gets used. And I think this new world is different and. And, oh. By the way, this is totally changing orgs. Like it changes like, you know, what does presales versus what is post sales. It changes. What does the customer success or it changes, you know, how do you incent the teams on these things, who do they report to, et cetera. So I mean, the changes kind of as dramatic as, as you can get. It's everything from product to sales to sales come to organizational design. And, and right now, by the way, like, I would say, you know, outside of like the researchers that, you know, Mark Zuckerberg is poaching for billions of dollars, like some of the most in demand people in the industry are post sales just because like actually expansion is driving most of the economics of of these companies. And so like really it also fits your, it fits your thesis around this idea of like actually it's like this like being multi product. Thinking about like okay, acquisition is not maybe not a solve problem, but it's like a much easier problem. It's a much easier problem now than it has. Yes, exactly. So it's almost like we've shift like it used to be everything was like just get people to, like, get the product. It was so hard. And you, like, spend, especially in every sector, spend years starving for oxygen, like, waiting. And now you basically can get users by subsidizing it and almost everything in the company, strategically. I mean, listen, I'm trying not to be categorical. It's not. It's not categorically true, but so much focus has shifted to. All right, you have users now. What? And that's really what a lot of strategic bulk is. Okay, one last question, and then I'll jump to Q and A. But as an investor, I guess, like, what. What is the biggest, like, kind of mindset change you've had to make over maybe the past year now that this stuff is, like, slightly maturing, it's like, it's obviously, we're like injuring them. Maybe the like some amount of stabilization phase, maybe it's just going to get crazier from here. Who knows? But like, what's your biggest update as an investor? As you're like looking at these companies on day one of because you invest primarily at seed, right? So, like, when you're seeing companies for the first time. Like, what is the thing that is updated the most for you? I mean, I just think that we kind of know what's working and there's areas that speculative and I think we just tend to conflate these things. So what do we know that is working? Bringing down the marginal cost of creation to zero is working. And what is that creating you? Creating all sorts of stuff, right? You're creating images, you're creating videos, you're creating stories. So, like, that. Like, those companies are really, really working. And, you know, we hear a lot of these, like, whatever. That stupid MIT report of like, 95% of enterprise things fail. These things just don't make any sense like this. Is a prosumer revolution of creatives, and there's tons of profitable companies at scale in that space. So, like, that's definitely working, right? Coding is definitely working, right. You know, it just turns out that, like, let's say there's 30 million developers, let's say, and there's. There's probably more, let's just say 30 million. Let's say they make on average of 100k a year. Right. 3 trillion dollar market. And you've got a tool that touches all of them and you've got multiple products at over a billion dollars. I mean, this is a really, really meaningful shift. So we know that's working. There's a less talked about thing that's working, which is like this kind of emotional connection stuff. Right. Like, some people were kind of grumpy about GPT 4.5 because it wasn't as obsequious for us. So, like, we do have an emotional connection. We have a bunch of very interesting companies that are kind of doing something computers have not been able to do is to do that. And so we now have a lot of clarity on things that are working. Language reasoning is working very well. Like, if there's a language reasoning task, you can do research, like, that's working. But there's things that are still not working. Right? And we just conflate these two. So again, the MIT 95% fail, probably what's happening there is, like, okay, so, like, there's some big company. And the board was like, we need AI. And then the CEOs like, We need AI. So they go to the platform team. We need AI. They're like, let's do AI. And then they hired Deloitte, and the Doy doesn't know what the hell they're doing. So, like, everybody. Comes in. I mean, in this new thing, Deloitte's great. I'm just saying, like, in this thing, and then they do AI. Which, of course, is going to be a total failure because, like, you know, the enterprise is just still trying to figure out how to do this. It's very much a secular. Phenomenon. It's very much coming from users. There's a shift in user behavior that means new product. This is an entirely new super cycle. So you can't look at kind of like enterprise buying. And so I would say my biggest takeaway is like, we know what's working. It's this very secular change and user behavior. We know what's still on the come, which is deep enterprise, you know, stuff. And that's kind of what where it's at right now. But we know that there's enough momentum that it's going to follow the same cycle as the Internet or the browser, where it always starts in the secular way, and it goes towards there. And so, listen, I think we can say, like, this stuff is magic, it's working, it's a big, huge wave. But that does not necessarily extend to things where it hasn't matured yet. And we just need to be kind of very sober about kind of where we are in the adoption cycle. Yeah, actually, that was the last question. But there's one question. I mean, every time I talk to you about this, no, there's a million more. But this one is, I think it's like, I think one of the things that's striking about you as an investor is you're very consistently in my opinion, kind of operating at the edge. You're, like, kind of in. I know you're in all the discords and all these weird things. How do you source these new things? I can't imagine you're taking emails from Inbox. What is your algorithm for exploring the edge and kind of consistently finding it. Listen, I've got the. I mean, I've got the best team on the planet. I've got a team of eight to 10 investors who. I mean, we kind of segment up the world. The way that we view about the world is I only focus on infrastructure. And if there's a set of two or three good founders in a space, we just view it as a viable space. Like, if a good founder is going to risk their opportunity, cost their family's wealth on it, it's a good space. And then we use that as kind of an indication of an interesting space. And then we just do all the research, we talk to all the customers, we talk to all the competitors, everything that we can to learn about that space. So we kind of follow the founder network. It requires a team to do that. And then again, we're fortunate to have a top portfolio that tends to have platforms and a lot of early adopters will use, and so we kind of have that visibility into this. But it's a very multifarious approach that requires a big team. And then, honestly, it's like, my favorite thing is innovation and startups. So it's where I spend all my free time, too, which helps. Cool. Ok. I'm going to jump to some user questions because there's a bunch of them. And actually maybe Maggie's going to jump on. Yeah, we have a ton of questions, so I'm hopping back on. I think there were a couple questions around. I think, Martin, what you said about AI solving the customer acquisition problem. So can you go a little bit deeper there on what you meant by that? Yeah. So for these models, it's the closest we've ever seen to just exposing a model to the market and then having users that you can actually monetize. We just haven't seen this before. There's so many examples. Companies going from 0 to 100 million or 50 million pretty quickly. And so if you look at the mean company that's a model company in this space, the problems they have tend not to be like, can you get someone to use it? I hate the term GPT rapper because it's actually not a real thing. It's this weird pejorative people come up with. But let's say you're doing a startup and your startup is like, I'm just going to take GPT and I'm just going to change the website. Like you're doing nothing. But I've got a website that's doing tpt. Five people will use that because it's so magical, right? And you've done nothing. All you've done, right? And so you're basically spending money to acquire users. And so you've got this kind of magical thing that you can expose to acquire users. And now all of the questions come down to how do you add value on top of the models. How are you defensible? How do you get away from kind of this kind of seesaw problem of model releases and then not being a kind of a frontier model? You know, how do you do defensibility, etc. So the problem has really moved from the acquisition problem, which these models tend to solve many times, to kind of the rest of the business. Great. And then there are a couple questions too, around what's shifting to usage based pricing? How do you think about revenue predictability and forecasting. Question for both of you. That's a. Scott, it's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a complicated question. Exactly. It's complicated. I think the short answer, I think. I think. The way that I like to think about this question is like, every company wants some amount of predictability, but you also want your, you also want unbounded amount of upside value, right? And so, like, the good thing about usage is that as it grows, like your value is growing the value you're providing to your end customer. And so getting to predictability and also, like, having a value model that scales, like, as. As your customers find value. Like, it's like, it's almost like. It's almost like if you had, like, if you're building a product like Facebook and for virality, like, you wouldn't really like, if you found a way to, like, drive virality through the roof, you wouldn't really question it too much. You'd be like, okay, cool, great. Like, this is a really good problem to have. And so what I find is that frequently when companies are asking the predictability question, really, they're kind of either worrying about, like, a fake thing that they haven't yet run into, or they actually have a real version of this where they're actually, like, trying to manage things really, really tightly and they have a lot of data. And so the reality of, like, managing essentially the predictability problem is it is a problem that isn't really fundamentally solvable in the early phase. And you really shouldn't stress about it too much. Investors will always ask about it because that's what investors do. They're trying to, like, minimize risk. But the reality is, like, I don't stress about it. And then at the point where you do have like, like a super highly used product. Yes. Then it becomes a problem and now you have the data to be able to go solve it. And it just, it requires like eight, honestly, just a lot of work and it like, it like, you know, the things you need to get, like, basically, if you just study like growth. As a concept, and you think a lot about, like, cohort based growth, and you get really good at, like, dialing in kind of very, you know, it's fairly standard, essentially, growth management, like, growth tactics. You can usually get to a model that's like, good enough to kind of be like, I can manage my business on this side. Now, sometimes the predictability question comes in the form of customers, where customers are like, I don't really want to have to. Like, I'm worried about unbounded spend on your platform, which is like a fair concern for a CFO or budget holder there. I actually look at this like, a product problem. So if you study OpenAI, for instance, when they sign their like super large enterprise customers, they like basically build in product tools to basically limit the amount of money that can be spent at the CFO's discretion. So they can basically say like, look, this user is only allowed to spend $10,000. This month, this user allowed to spend $100,000. This user only allowed to spend 1,000. And so what they're doing is they're transmuting this, like, concern around unbounded spend into a product that actually helps them control spend. And so actually, their budget tools are cost control tools are a core part of their product experience. And so frequently when customer. And then, and then that, plus like EDPs, which everyone's super familiar with buying from, like Amazon, from the hyperscalers. Those two things combined, like product experience, plus like a commercial kind of structure, kind of give customers the predictability, essentially the downside protection. That they need in order to feel good about buying. That's, that's generally how I've experienced it is like, almost always, like, there's a theoretical problem, but in practice, it's kind of solved with, like, fairly straightforward commercial structures and then investment in product resources and then also just kind of realizing that the flip side of being unable to protect the like, you're rapidly growing revenue is actually like a business that's growing at an unbounded rate, which is like, generally a good like falls into the champagne problems part of the curve. So I don't know, Martine, if you have a different view. But. No, I think that's great. I totally agree. This is kind of interesting. We talked a lot about the SaaS monetization shift. There are a couple questions, like if you're more established SaaS company and you can't move at the pace of SaaS monetization and how it's changing, is there any advice the two of you have there for companies struggling there. Yes. The basic answer is like I have like an hour long talk for ports about this exact position that I've given to many public company like sea level, sweet C suite. So the answer is like I will compress it down into like three simple recommendations and then if you like really have this problem, come talk to me. I'm happy to like, go venture here. So the first thing is, to Martine's earlier point, the move from seat based or, you know, let's say you're on a plat, like a flat fee subscription to usage is bigger than you probably think it is, and it affects every department. And so in order for that to work, it's like a major transformational moment. So the right way to handle this is to deputize someone to basically push this through the organization. Because the entire organization is inertially set up to resist this change. Like, just straight up, your sales comp won't work. Your product development process won't work, your product doesn't work for it. So you actually have to take it super seriously. And if the CEO doesn't care or the board doesn't care, it's not happening. And don't even try. Like, that's my first advice. The second advice that I think is really, really critical is start small but with conviction. So sometimes you see these companies, they try to do this, like, boil the ocean. Like, I'm gonna move 5 billion in ARR from a seat based plan to a usage based plan in a year or two. That is never gonna work. Like, never. And so what you actually have to do. The smart companies, what they're doing is they're launching new AI native products they're using as a brand like kind of product building moment. And what they're doing is they're starting that product as a $0 product and they're treating it like a $0 product where they don't know anything about the viral loops or how to sell it or anything like that. And what they're doing is they're planning over time to shift that 5 billion over to like 10 billion on this new usage based product, but they're doing it over like half a decade, and they're like. And so they're both acting with urgency, and they are also having a stomach that can survive for next three to five years. And if you try to do it too fast, your business will reject it. If you try to do it, if you don't treat it like a new product. You try to hold it to the old your super safe product management philosophy where every change review takes two months. You're also gonna lose because your competition is AI native and you're gonna move way too slow. And so the best companies, what they're doing is essentially they're using it like a little. Bit of a refounding moment and they're kind of taking this AI native product and they're putting their most enterprising startup aligned like PM or product leader or gm and just saying, here's a budget. Just go run at this thing as hard and as fast as possible and what you will see, by the way is if you do this right is that product line will grow as fast as a cursor or a lovable like I have many different examples of public companies that have launched AI native products that started at zero in January and are now at 150 million like a year into or less than a year into the product. Why is that? It's because Martine called. I actually like this frame that Martine uses, which is AI is magic. When you're selling magic, turns out people fucking love magic. And you have a distribution channel that is huge. And so it is like, you have this back book that you can, like, if you actually do have magic, you can find these viral loops and you can get growth that looks like, looks like an AI native startup within this giant context. It just requires, though, that you strip away all the bureaucratic crap that comes with being a large company. And if you do that, you actually can capture this lightning in a bottle. And there's tons of examples in the wild. Like, you know, I won't name them, but, like, all the public companies that have this, and you can bet they're talking about it in their freaking 10Ks, it's like front and center in these things. I think there's a very important aspect of this to call out, which is the only real sin in the CPOC is zero sum thinking. And I think that a lot of companies are in paralysis because they're like, oh, SAS is dead. Like, this is gonna change. There's just patently not true. This is a new behavior. It solves a new class of problems. Like, user expectation is going to evolve, but that doesn't mean that these companies are irrelevant. Right. And I just feel like there's this big explosion, and then a lot of companies, like, wait, I'm still here now. They're kind of, like, coming up with, like, they kind of survived the first wave of these things. And the reality is, listen, AI is not great at system of record. It's not great at transactional guarantees. It's not great at things that traditional computers really good at. So if you are one of those companies, and that's what you do, you have to realize that the user expectation is going to evolve, and you're going to have to there are probably areas of your product that AI is very good at, and you're going to have to evolve to those. But this isn't the existential crisis that I think most people are doing it as. And so I would just recommend, like, listen, if you're in the stage, do not succumb to the paralysis of like, oh, all is lost. Realize that you can incrementally do this. I think Scott articulated very well, but the zero sum thinking is the worst. It's like, oh, this is going to come at the cost of everything we do. It's just the wrong mentality. I agree. And I think that the key thing I've observed is that you can actually, because we sell to a lot of these companies, you can kind of sort them on the first call where you're like, are you, are you both. Enterprising and willing to question the status quo, but you're also not, like, fatalistic. You're kind of like. You're just like. You're. You're in this, like, mindset of. Yeah, we know that there's not a huge opportunity for us here.

### You (2025-11-04T19:55:18.680Z)

How they were.

### Guest (2025-11-04T19:55:20.760Z)

And, and we have the air cover to go do the things we need to go do. And I think that, like, balance is pretty rare, but when you see it, you can, you can tell, like, it's, like, extremely obvious. And I think the, the smartest CEOs are kind of, they're understanding it now, and. They're seeing the positive examples. Like, I think Figma is like, Ben, pretty successful on this front, and I think you can kind of see it. And I think the smart CEOs are like, okay, cool, let's just do that. Let's just do that. Like, let's copy the playbooks and. The playbooks are being written right now. I don't think anyone has a perfect one yet, but you could start to see that. You can start to see it happening. And I think the good thing is a lot of these companies are public, so they're kind of forced to talk about it. And in fact, they love talking about it because it's, like, pure marketing upside for them. I think we have time for one last rapid question. But I know both of you talked about, like, acquisition kind of being unbounded now and the shift towards defensibility. Is there any advice you'd have folks take away on thinking about defensibility, where monetization plays a role in that? Martine will let you go. I think you thought about this a lot. Where monetization impacts defensibility. Or just defensibility in general. And if monetization. Listen, here's the best that we have, which. Probably, as far as we can tell, no endemic moats in AI that are new, that are, like, endemic to the technology. In fact, you could argue there's perverse economies of scale, because these models get distilled pretty easily, so it's pretty easy for incumbents to catch up. And they're actually very resistant, layered by software. And so it's kind of the exposure directly to the user. And so users can just kind of move between them without getting locked into a complex workflow. And so they're almost defensibility resistant in a way. And so the companies that do do defensibility, they actually kind of get very good at more traditional notes. Like I've been to two sided marketplaces. One brand, one is another one. You'll see a lot of these companies actually really lean into brand because like in Marx, they're spending this quickly. It's very important. I say distribution is very much a mount, which goes to monetization. For me, if a company comes in, they're like, we're gross margin negative. And I look and I look at the company, and I'm like, oh, 60% of it's positive. They made the decision to go for distribution. I'm like, yeah, I would definitely want to. Invest and be in that, because distribution is very much a strategic mode in an early market like this, which is directly tied to it. And then there's just a lot of the enterprise modes, like a lot of these solutions require understanding the enterprise needs and kind of the long tails instead of integrations, et cetera, and so if you listen, if you're an AI company or logic and AI product, I would lean heavily on traditional moats, lean heavily on distribution. Again, I think to have the effect of an optimist correctly, especially as you go multiproduct, you want to do it usage based. And listen, this is one of these areas, we're still learning. So maybe, Scott, you and I have this webinar. In a year, things have changed everyone on the data points that we'll collect in a year. Yeah. I think my belief on it, as someone who's a founder in this space, is that I kind of fundamentally distrust the concept of moats in the sense that I think it can be hard to. It's hard to say that anything in the fullness of time won't get evaporated. But what I do know is doing one hard thing is hard. Doing two hard things is really uniquely hard Things is impossible. And so if you think you can do it, that is like a really attractive thing for us. And so the way I think about it is when you're building a product in market, pick a market where your product is disruptive, and if you can find the synthesis of also where the business model is disruptive, then your incumbent is both forced to follow on the product and they have to update their entire go to market motion. And they're like, commercial motion. And so it's why I'm like, obviously I'm a vendor in the space, but why I think usage is so disruptive because you're getting a double disruption at the incumbent level, where you're getting disrupted on the product and on the business model. And so you actually have to make two massive changes at the exact same time. And that's just really hard in the inertial context. And so if you're a founder in this space, finding those soft spots in the market substructure is just so. What you will find is that if your competitor is a tech company, they'll probably be able to follow you on product. Eventually they'll clone what you're doing, but they'll be so slow on the go to market side and on the distribution side to Martin's. Point. And I think that's, to me, the magic is like, you just do both. And the good thing is you're young, you're early. You can build your company to be usage or consumption native or outcome native. You can build all the incentive structures from day one to kind of fit in this price to value model, and especially if you're competing against companies that aren't that way. Basically, every excess seat that Salesforce sells is your opportunity. Their margin is your opportunity, very literally in this space. And I think that combining the two is actually the easiest way to build a really massive business and grow really fast. Well, I think that's a great place to end it. Thank you so much, Scott and Martine, for the conversation. We still have a lot of Q and A, so we'll follow up with folks we didn't get answers to today, but we have one more webinar in the series with lovable so stay tuned for that one. Awesome.
