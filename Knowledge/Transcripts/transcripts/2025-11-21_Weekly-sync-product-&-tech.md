# Transcript for: Weekly sync product & tech

### You (2025-11-21T15:05:16.678Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:05:20.757Z)

Sorry. For some reason I thought this was cancer. Let me call Raj or Sebum. Okay. Whoever is available. I think Sevam wanted to. Show the mattresses as well as the chat thing.

### You (2025-11-21T15:05:34.678Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:05:35.637Z)

Give me a moment, okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:05:37.398Z)

No problem.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:06:02.357Z)

I need to draw. I'll join back. I cannot call when I'm on teams. Thank you. Okay. Rather than stay on my joining in few minutes.

### You (2025-11-21T15:07:32.598Z)

Okay? Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:07:38.517Z)

Or things at your end. Here. I don't know whether it is you and me. There's no sound.

### You (2025-11-21T15:07:49.958Z)

No, it's me. I was muted. Sorry about that.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:07:52.437Z)

Okay, I can hear now.

### You (2025-11-21T15:07:53.478Z)

Yeah. Everything's going okay.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:07:56.357Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:07:57.158Z)

Just.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:07:57.317Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-11-21T15:07:59.078Z)

A rule? Probably. Be logging off after this call.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:03.317Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:08:03.958Z)

We have showing. For the cottage tomorrow. Somebody wants to take a look at it. I got to go up. And get it cleaned up and ready to show.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:16.357Z)

You are. This guy still is up as soon as my meeting starts. He'll not come at other times, but as soon as I get into meeting, he'll just come up here.

### You (2025-11-21T15:08:28.038Z)

Up. Put in board. Tell me. It's got to take notes.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:32.197Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:08:34.678Z)

How's the world? Is he still having issues with the coffin?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:40.517Z)

That's rowd. After that earbud, we didn't hear him coughing or anything.

### You (2025-11-21T15:08:44.838Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:44.997Z)

So far, so good. Yeah. For any contact with the inhc going to join on Tuesday.

### You (2025-11-21T15:08:57.078Z)

Old. I haven't spoken to her.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:08:59.957Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:09:03.718Z)

She did send me a copy of a sample loan agreement. So. I think I'll go through and I've kind of highlight some of the things that we would want to be able to extract. Socialant can kind of. I'll forward it. You guys can play around with it.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:09:25.957Z)

Sounds good. Hey, Howard. How are you?

### You (2025-11-21T15:09:28.438Z)

Good evening. How are you? Good.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:09:30.437Z)

Yeah, I'm doing good. How are you doing? Great.

### You (2025-11-21T15:09:40.358Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:09:41.557Z)

Is Badran? Yeah, I see him in the lobby. For Arjun. It's hard to join because it is always time as well. So. He's probably will have to find a better time when he can join as well. But then that won't work out for these guys because he's available bit late.

### You (2025-11-21T15:10:00.758Z)

Good. We. Could record these as well. Whatever. You.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:10:08.197Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:10:08.278Z)

Got.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:10:09.477Z)

Yeah, yeah. You ready? To show. Wherever you are in a local either it is mattresses or chatbot. Yeah. Okay, let's start with matrices, then. Chat part. Just a minute. Yeah, go ahead, Sivam. What are you waiting for me? No. Yeah, just. Guys must be invisible. So for the top matrices. We got this cap rate and cap rates, like for these, we need to fill like for this irr, roi, NCOC return. We need to go to the valuation page and fill some previews. And in here. Once the data to save these parameters. And. One question for you, Howard. Like about it is about the noi. So in these, like for the calculation of IRR and some more metrics. We need noi, so. This net operating income is for per year, right? Like 2020 2021. So different year have different noi for these calculation. What? And why do I do we have to use.

### You (2025-11-21T15:12:39.398Z)

These will have to be for the last year. The year of the sale.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:12:47.237Z)

So you mean the acquisition or the latest year?

### You (2025-11-21T15:12:55.318Z)

If you go with the pro forma. Yeah. So if you wanted to perform a page. Okay? You don't have it. On here? All right, so the whole period. Whatever they input for the whole period. Right. Whether it's three, five, ten years or whatever. You want to calculate all of these are based on? The. Year with sale. Now up in some of these are cumulative, and that would be on the investment summary page. But the noi. For. Let me take. A look here. So we got the investment rich. Ard. So the cap rate on the exit. So which one are we asking about?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:13:57.317Z)

Like the irr.

### You (2025-11-21T15:13:58.918Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:14:00.117Z)

I saw that in irr. And one more matrices, we need the noi.

### You (2025-11-21T15:14:05.478Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:14:05.877Z)

For now. I thought about the accusation when the starting year.

### You (2025-11-21T15:14:11.238Z)

Okay? So my recommendations. Let's go to the investment summary page.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:14:18.837Z)

Okay? Actually.

### You (2025-11-21T15:14:27.078Z)

You don't have.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:14:27.717Z)

We haven't worked much on this page.

### You (2025-11-21T15:14:29.558Z)

Okay, let me take a look here. Let me share my screen here. So. Let me know when you can see my screen.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:15:07.157Z)

Yeah, I can see. Now.

### You (2025-11-21T15:15:08.358Z)

All right. Let me. Close out a couple things here. I always had trouble. And I'm sharing. My screen with being buggy. All right. So this investment summary page. Is. Really where we should be calculating all of these numbers on top. Because a lot of that comes from. A sum of the. Net operating income. Down here. And so in this particular example, it's a five year hold, right? So we've got year zero, which is the year of acquisition. Historical has nothing to do with any of these calculations. Up above here. So it's only for year zero in the home period. So for each of those, we're going to take our revenue expenses, et cetera. All the way down to the Noi line. And. This is going to be used along with. The. Sales proceeds is used in some of these calculations. And then this is where you're going to calculate two levels. Of cash flow. So. I would not try to calculate. Those cards. Until you can get. The investment. Summary page. Finished. Does that. Make sense.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:16:50.277Z)

Good. Yep, it does. But I think for the calculation of some of these matrices, we need the values from valuation page, right? Like some cash flows. And there were some more terms.

### You (2025-11-21T15:17:06.518Z)

That's the thing, is there's. There's basically you. You do. You do need both. So before trying to calculate those metric cards on the top, you're going to have to get the rest of these pages. Working. Down below. So you're going to have to be able to to pull in. So if I go back to the valuation page. Some of these will not calculate. Until you get both pages. Well, the investor summary, there's no inputs. But you need. To take, you know? Those yearly. Numbers. For each year in order to make these calculations. Up here. And they are. They are intended to be the same. So whatever we have up here are the same investment summary cards here. And that. That. That's what I'm trying to say is that, yes, you do need to have. Each not just a particular of the year. Did you need to have? Each investment year. The only exception to that is the cap rate at the exit. Which is based on the noi of the year. You sell it. It's not a cumulative. So the. The. Formula prd. There's a document that I shared with everybody, has all of the formulas in should. Explain where all of these are coming from. But it's not clean. In any way. I mean, it doesn't all come from the same page. Which is why you have to kind of. Do both. So again. My suggestion is make sure that all of these items. Are calculating. Down here. On all of these inputs. And. Then. Go to the. Investment summary page. Make sure what? All of these are coming through. And then you'll. You should have everything you need. To calculate these values up above.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:19:14.037Z)

Here.

### You (2025-11-21T15:19:14.278Z)

Okay? In that formula document. I. Went to great banks to include screenshots. So that. Should be no question. Exactly. Which. Rows, which columns, which values are needed. In there. So if you have any questions after you're after reviewing that, that document, We can. Get together again. And figure this out.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:19:49.557Z)

So. That. Okay? Great. Yeah. If I would have any questions about it. I'll ping you.

### You (2025-11-21T15:20:08.038Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:20:09.397Z)

Mail.

### You (2025-11-21T15:20:09.638Z)

If you can't find that document, I can resend the link after the call.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:20:15.557Z)

Yeah, actually, I have those documents.

### You (2025-11-21T15:20:17.158Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:20:20.117Z)

Here. So let me move to another thing where we have the chat bot. Actually, I have this chat bot in my local not haven't pushed it in dev or stage yet. So for now, we have this AI button here. Like I'm running it on local. So we have this kind of scenery tab, but it won't be visible in the stage or development environment. So the user can go here. And.

### You (2025-11-21T15:21:05.158Z)

There we go. I was looking to see where your cursor was. Okay.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:21:10.117Z)

Yeah. So this is how it looks, and what happens is, the data we extracted from these deals. Like we have this day, right? I just named it anything, but it's from the west. It's from the Western. Wait, let me check. If it is from west end. Or it is from the western one.

### You (2025-11-21T15:21:35.958Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:21:36.757Z)

This document so. If we have this chat bot and user can ask anything about this document that he has uploaded, like. Show me the expense breakdown. And, like, whatever questions he want to shoot. Any question. Tell me about. How did my song. In these. 24. And user can ask any random questions about his property. If we ask specific number, like what was my departmental expenditures in year 2024? What was my total expense or revenue? Okay, so let's see. Let's look at this one. So, like, right now, it gave overall kind of like total revenue, ebit occupancy. ADR and ref bar so we can ask for detailed breakdown too. Also. Then you give me. Down of sd. So yeah. It gives detail breakdown also. Like revenue breakdown. Room revenue is 26 million, so we can check for 2024. Or we can check from pro forma also.

### You (2025-11-21T15:23:48.918Z)

Co. Ol?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:23:49.317Z)

Like the revenue and.

### You (2025-11-21T15:23:49.958Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:23:54.117Z)

So room revenues 26. Like approximately. It's 26.302 million 36K. And like it shows here, the food beverage is 7.2 million. And I think, yes, it rounded off this 165 to 2. Which is fine. Yeah. And same for 2025. It says 26.9 million. And here it is. 26.9 million. And the operational matrix like room available. Here. Like available room and occupied room 152, 136. 152. And152 and yeah. 2025-15-2570. And 52570. And like this data it give matches the performer. Because the data we are showing in Performa is extracted from the document. And we are providing the same data to. The chatbot like the Model 2.

### You (2025-11-21T15:25:11.398Z)

That is very good. Very good.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:25:14.437Z)

You have any questions you wanted to ask?

### You (2025-11-21T15:25:17.718Z)

No. No, not. Not yet. So. One of the things that I want to get to is. You know, this is really good, especially the bottom. The top is good because it gives you a different way of looking at the numbers. But I want to use. The. AI. To guide the users or to point out things that they may not be aware of. So, like down below, you've got your not. Able observations. And, you know, it says right there, a slight revenue growth despite declining occupancy. That. That's, that's great, right? Because when you're just looking at numbers, those correlations might not jump out.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:26:08.197Z)

Here.

### You (2025-11-21T15:26:11.398Z)

Where this is going to be super helpful. Is when we get those KPI cards populated. Right, so once you close.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:26:23.077Z)

The irr. You mean the irr and ry.

### You (2025-11-21T15:26:27.078Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. So those cards, those five cards that are at the top. So from an investor standpoint, You know? An investor will have a minimum return. On. Their investment. That they expect. And when they input the numbers here, if it doesn't meet their criteria, then we're not going to buy the property. So if I'm running it, I say I have to have a 12% ir. R. But when I'm done and I go into Portland, I'm only at, like, 11.3%, right? What I want to do is I want to go to this AI Analysis and say, What? Assumptions that I import or what can we change in order to get the 12%? Because. What they're going to be doing now is they're going to go and they're going to find a sell and then change a number and then they're going to look and see whether it is okay. And then they just keep going back and forth, back and forth until finally gets 12%. If. I can just put in the AI and say I need a 12% return. It can go through and it can change. Then it becomes a question of when I buy the property, when actually operating. The property. Are. Those assumptions realistic. Right. But. That is going to be a huge. Time saver and improvement is that. It's going to keep them from having to go back and forth. In fact, you know, like, even going to different pages, they may have to go to. Their variation pages and make different assumptions there. And then go back to the marketing. I mean, they have to jump all around. But if we could just have an AI Come back and say, In order to achieve a 12% rate of return. And then point out that the changes they can make. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:28:29.717Z)

Can we try that prompt here? Power just. For. We can try. What do you get? Right? Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:28:39.158Z)

I don't think you've got enough data in there. To do something like that. You've only got one. Year of historical one year of fore. Casts. But.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:28:47.797Z)

Yeah. We should have other documents which has more data. For three, four years. Actually, I don't think we have any documents which contain three or four years data.

### You (2025-11-21T15:29:06.118Z)

I didn't even make it up. One of the things you can do is just take. You can take 85 national statement and then just change the dates in the headers.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:29:11.477Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:29:16.598Z)

And then also make random changes to the numbers. So you don't have. Five identical columns. Right, but you could still just make minor tweaks. It might take a minute. I mean, you can even use a random number generator or something.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:29:29.717Z)

Yeah. I can edit it.

### You (2025-11-21T15:29:35.958Z)

Yeah. So you can just make up the data.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:29:41.717Z)

And yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:29:41.798Z)

One of the things I use. One of the things I used to do when I was doing this is I would just create a formula.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:29:42.597Z)

That's.

### You (2025-11-21T15:29:49.318Z)

That basically. You know, cop. Y and paste across. But it would. Take. Multiply. Like see 108. Times. One plus and then a random number. Generator. Like. From one to one, so it could be like. Randomly up or down by. One percent. Or 3%, whatever you put in that range. In a copy of. The cross. And it's pretty quick. Then you stick whatever values you output, go back and paste it into the. Source. And now you've got your next year.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:30:30.437Z)

Good, but I think most of these Excel files. Are okay. This one is editable. Can I change the year here?

### You (2025-11-21T15:30:54.678Z)

Formula.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:30:57.317Z)

I think it might be. Yeah, actually, it might be the, like, we wanted to change the date, right? Like, from 2025?

### You (2025-11-21T15:31:04.438Z)

Yeah. Click on that cell. Let me see what the formula is. It's a text. See how it's got the apostrophe before the FYI?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:31:18.037Z)

Yeah. Oh, can we change?

### You (2025-11-21T15:31:18.358Z)

Could be if you backspace on the funnel and just put in 2026 or 2024. It's not changing.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:31:26.117Z)

Okay, let's do 20, 24. Ah. Okay. Yeah, now it's good. Yeah. Great.

### You (2025-11-21T15:31:32.038Z)

Just. Overwrite it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:31:35.637Z)

Let's do this two or three times.

### You (2025-11-21T15:31:38.438Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:31:39.957Z)

Save this. Actually, it would be save in my OneDrive and I don't have access to this one. Nothing is ras. Are you on your laptop? Can you find one? Or share the same sheet. I think you have access to one. Try. Yes, I do have. What do you want me to do? Like, just edit that file, right? Here. You see which is multiple here. If not, it's fine. We can do it some other time. Okay? Okay? So how do you think we can push this to dev or stage? Or it can be value addition for our demo purpose.

### You (2025-11-21T15:32:53.878Z)

That's for the offline pushing. That's a stage. Just keep on testing it. A little bit long down, but, yeah, I think this is good. Yeah. Let's get the core down. Let's make sure we get those KPI cards.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:06.037Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:08.438Z)

Working. And everything else. Then let's come.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:10.517Z)

All. Right.

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:13.878Z)

The AI, but yeah. That would be a huge win in a double situation. If we have that AI. Working properly.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:30.197Z)

So as far as those KPI cards are concerned, those are the final cards for the demo, right? Or is.

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:36.118Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:37.717Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:39.318Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:41.237Z)

I mean, from the lender perspective. We'll need to change them. Or these are the final one.

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:48.838Z)

They'll be different from the lender.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:33:50.597Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-21T15:33:52.518Z)

So yeah. That prd that I sent yesterday. I'm breaking it down into chunks. So the PRDs I sent yesterday will be for the revised. Input or deal Creation and editing modal. And there may be one more page. Sure. One more page. So I know it's got four pages to the logo. Based on our conversation yesterday. Where? We need to. Add a couple. More from. What we have on. The valuation. Page. I. May make one more. Short. Quick, easy. Revision to. That. So you want me to kind of go over that right now, or do you think it's too early?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:34:55.957Z)

I think it's a little early. Let's finalize the version and then we can do it.

### You (2025-11-21T15:34:59.878Z)

All right. So, just so you guys know, we are creating a demo version which is very generic. It doesn't fit any one particular. Persona. But. The first group of. Clients that we're going to go for. Are the lenders. So you're going to see some emails from me. And some additional PRDs that will be lender specific. And. That's what. We're talking about here, so we'll have to. Basically create a version. Of this lender. But another thing you need to do is we need to start thinking about. And I think I mentioned this before. If I'm repeating myself, I apologize. But we don't want to maintain a bunch of different models. So one of the things we also need to do is we need to set up our account and user tables. So at the account level, we'll determine which model. They use. So if we have a bank. That is a lender. Right. They will see. The lender. Version. In all of the users that. Are associated with that bank. Will all have access to that, but we don't want to have different models, so we're going to have to come up with. A simple process. Basically. It's an if, then. So if. Persona equals lender. Then. And. We'll have to actually make this down to the component level. And the KPI cards are a great example, right? So. If account equals. Lender. Then. Whatever those lender specific cards are at the top of the page. Will display. And then if Persona or if account equals investor, then. Like ir. R roi those cards will display. So we're going to have to get down to, like, the component level, whether we use flags. I mean, however you guys think this is going to be best. Because the last thing we want to do is have to maintain multiple versions. Right. So the math, all of that stuff down below. Is. All the same. So profil all of those things are all going to be. Uniform throughout all these different ones. So it's just little things like those KPI cards. That will need to be changed. And when we get to dashboards and reports, things like that, There will be changes there. But you guys can start thinking about how you think we should get that set up. And what would be the best way to. Maintain that. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:38:08.757Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I mean, yeah, for now, let's focus on the items that we are already working on. And then, you know, this Lender Persona will take in version one.

### You (2025-11-21T15:38:19.078Z)

Yeah. So yeah. I'll be sending out these documents. But. Don't waste any time on them until we've got this ready for demo. And the other thing is, Shadano mentioned to me that you are also looking at document extraction. AI beyond the financial statements. That's going to be a huge part of this tool. As well. And. In particular. Extracting data. From, like, loan documents. And so I have a sample loan document I'm going to send to you. And again. Don't chase rabbits. I'm here. You know, let's. Let's focus on getting the demo version. But we're going to do this. I don't even know I'm highlight. Some of the paragraphs and the items. In a loan document. That we would need to extract. And a lot of the stuff that we're working on right now, the, the enable inputs, we can automate. So the lender doesn't have or the bothered to thinkable and put in the interest rate and all of those financing terms. We could automatically populate by uploading this document and just extracting the data. So those are the updates I've. I've got, but I'll. I'll go ahead and send that out sometime over the weekend.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:39:44.117Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-11-21T15:39:45.318Z)

All right. All right. This is really good. I love that. AI. Again. You're following them, and I thought it would be so. Appreciate it. Anything else? Any other questions or anything?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:40:04.357Z)

The demo? Yeah, go ahead. Sir. No, no. You can go ahead. So for demo, I think these KPI cards on valuation and. Performa as well as on the investment summary. Right. One is that and then the other one is the feedback that Drew has provided. I don't think there is much few things to picks and yeah, that is all for the demo and then we'll move to land rewards and yes.

### You (2025-11-21T15:40:22.678Z)

Yes. Y. Eah. One thing we absolutely have to do is be able to. Get, you know, at least two or five years of the forecast projected data. So, yeah, if you can just take a financial statement, whichever one we're going to use. Dream, did. Send us a financial statement. That has been working for him. And he's created a demo folder so that when we do demos, we'll always use the same. Data.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:41:12.517Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-21T15:41:14.038Z)

So is the financial statement that you showed me the one that he's using? For demos.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:41:19.477Z)

For the demo. No, no, that's. Those are probably different. I'll you. Yeah, we can use those. I think he has put profiles there.

### You (2025-11-21T15:41:26.438Z)

Well. Yeah. Okay, so. So, yeah, if he's got one that is working for him, let's just use that. I can do this. Just do the same. Just take that financial statement, create. Actually, those are historical, not projected. Right. So, yeah, take 2024 to create a 2023 and a 2022. You know you only. Need maybe three, four years of historical at the most. Yeah. And then we can. Use. That for projecting based on whatever the input for the whole period. Okay? And if you need help, the rock. I said, I used to do this all the time when I was budgeting and creating different projects. I mean, I can help. Convert. And make. Some dummy data. For prior. Years as well, so just let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:42:22.997Z)

If you could provide some multi year there would be helpful. Howard.

### You (2025-11-21T15:42:27.078Z)

Okay? All right. Y. Eah. So I use. I will use the one. That drew uploaded. And used that.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:42:37.717Z)

So just go through upload. I have that, so, yeah, I think we can use that.

### You (2025-11-21T15:42:40.678Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:42:45.157Z)

I'll send it to you. Shivam and Raj defines the drawers using. Yeah. Those files. I'm just sending it. To you. Yeah. Anything else, guys? Yeah. Just a one quick question. Let me share my screen. So, Howard, for this cash on cash return. The formula is leveraged cash flow divided by initial equity and multiplied by 100. So this leveraged cash flow. We are getting from this investment summary page, right?

### You (2025-11-21T15:43:33.798Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:43:35.637Z)

So to we have to take this total one. Like, I think, like, you show the screenshot here. So which value do we have to use from here?

### You (2025-11-21T15:43:49.238Z)

It'll do the sum of all years.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:43:53.077Z)

Sum of all years.

### You (2025-11-21T15:43:53.878Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:43:53.957Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-21T15:43:54.358Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:43:56.197Z)

Gotcha. Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask.

### You (2025-11-21T15:43:56.918Z)

So. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:44:00.837Z)

Got. It.

### You (2025-11-21T15:44:01.238Z)

So those are the things where if it's not clear in the document, let me know. But yeah. I can go and confirm.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:44:07.397Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:44:09.478Z)

I'll confirm that and make sure it's the correct one.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:44:16.917Z)

Gotcha. Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. And I think it would be for most of the cases, right? It would be saying, like taking this on and in this, like when we are on. On it. I would just ask this also. So here we are saying year one and why so. If user acquired acquired the property in 2024. So 2024 is the year zero. So here we have to take NOI of 2025, right?

### You (2025-11-21T15:44:49.318Z)

Y. Es. Y.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:44:52.997Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-21T15:44:52.998Z)

Eah. Why you. Want.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:44:54.277Z)

That's it.

### You (2025-11-21T15:44:54.838Z)

Now. Okay, never mind. I think it would confuse. If I. Yeah. Let's just stick with what it's got there.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:45:07.397Z)

Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask.

### You (2025-11-21T15:45:08.758Z)

Y. Eah, yeah. Okay, cool. There are a couple of new calculations that I need to add in there. They do not. Affect the demo. So I will. Let. Everybody. Know what? I've made some modifications to that document, make sure everybody's working on the most. Recent version. But. Yeah, we should be. We should be all set.

### Guest (2025-11-21T15:45:40.357Z)

People. All right, guys. And I did send you the files as well, so we have got there. As well.

### You (2025-11-21T15:45:46.998Z)
