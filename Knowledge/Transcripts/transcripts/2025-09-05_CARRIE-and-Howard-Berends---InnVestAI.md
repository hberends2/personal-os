### Guest (2025-09-05T18:30:15.974Z)

Hey, Howard. Happy Friday.

### You (2025-09-05T18:30:19.174Z)

Yeah. Happy Friday. How you doing?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:30:23.814Z)

Doing? Well, I'm actually going to have my camera off because I got my wisdom teeth removed, so I'm a little bruised.

### You (2025-09-05T18:30:32.854Z)

That's fun.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:30:35.254Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T18:30:39.414Z)

Well, sorry to hear that, but any humorous stories to share while you were under the influence of the anesthetic?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:30:54.694Z)

I honestly don't know what happened. I went in and I came out. I was like, was it. A lot of pain everywhere. But I wanted. I had a conversation, you guys, earlier this week, and I just want to get back to you guys as soon as possible.

### You (2025-09-05T18:31:03.094Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, hope everything feels all right with the wisdom teeth. I know it'll hurt for a while.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:31:18.294Z)

Yeah, thank you for asking. To ask, so why don't you just talk about next step? Versus what would you say are the most pressing priorities I should begin working on first? I did see send a few emails. But I can also create a doc that lists out all the deliverables.

### You (2025-09-05T18:31:40.774Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:31:40.934Z)

You like to see. So it'll be kind of like a deliverable update tracker sort of speak.

### You (2025-09-05T18:31:45.654Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:31:46.934Z)

Thoughts on that.

### You (2025-09-05T18:31:48.694Z)

Okay? Yeah, there was a lot of stuff that was sent out. I know Diane sent that list with LinkedIn. That's just for reference. All she wanted to do with that was to give you an idea of some of the styles of the marketing. That those people or organizations are putting out. So it wasn't a request to copy or do anything. It was just an FYI.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:32:20.934Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:32:22.934Z)

I sent you a couple of the things. The first was the email that had some sample logos that we've already come up with, just to kind of give you an idea of what direction we're heading now.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:32:38.694Z)

It's just the two logos, right? I see. There's one in orange and blue, and there's one in navy and green.

### You (2025-09-05T18:32:45.334Z)

Yeah. I don't know why, but the two files that were PNG files. Displayed in the body of the email. And then there's another one. That was an SVG file that was an attachment. So if that. If it didn't have the attachment with the email, let me know. But it's very similar. And I honestly don't remember. I'd have to go back and look at the email. But there was one, the one that I like. Personally has above the in kind of looks like some buildings that one of one of them has like little windows in it. So it looks like looks like a hotel.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:33:30.294Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-05T18:33:30.774Z)

And then what I sent today. I'm a big believer in. The pers uasive advertising and. Kind of what? I don't know. Subliminal type of things. And so I just sent you some research I did about what colors are best for this type of product. And so that's all that was today. It was just a copy of the Perplexity. I think it said blues and greens. Grays and, you know, maybe a splattering of gold here and there, but. And again, it's just FYI, nobody's trying to, you know, push you down a particular road, but those are just the. That's really about all we even have right there. So you've got what we've. Got. But yeah. Yeah, I guess what we need to talk about is how we want to. To move forward. And so I do think. We talked to the team yesterday. Our immediate need is to get the logo. We have trademark on the name and the logo. And the sooner the better because the there are. I think we just went over to minute ago, we were taking a look at the budget. I think there's about four. Conferences. In the next couple of months that Mark and Drew and maybe Diane will be attending. So, you know, even if we just have some brochures or something like that that we can hand out or talking about it, so that's. We. We do need a logo.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:35:24.054Z)

Ay.

### You (2025-09-05T18:35:35.494Z)

Pretty quick. And then some type of. A physical marketing thing. I mean, we would still need to talk to talk about it. Whether. Whether we just want to add something on the website or both. You know, maybe we have something on the website that's marketing related, and maybe we can print out a PDF that they can hand out. You know? Cause we don't have a product that is in any. Position yet to be demonstrated. And so until we can actually sit down with somebody, share our screens and walk them through it, we do need to have some type of. Information that we can email, that we can put on the website, etc. So in our websites, pretty bare. It's basically just one page with a little bit of a teaser and a click here to be put on our waiting list. We've done no type of PR or announcements. I mean, nobody even knows this website exists. So we've got time to do whatever we want to do and get it ready. Without having to worry about, you know, traffic or, you know, if we have to shut down the website and nobody will know. So I would say that's really our immediate need before now, you know, maybe in the next 30 to 60 days.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:37:17.334Z)

Yeah, I can definitely help with the logo and website design and making a brochure. I think what will be helpful is if you guys can provide any information of what you guys want on the brochure. These conferences, what are the target users? So I can cater to that. And another question I had was, who currently manages the website?

### You (2025-09-05T18:37:36.934Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:37:42.134Z)

So I can update it, potentially.

### You (2025-09-05T18:37:44.934Z)

Vinode put the website together.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:37:47.814Z)

Okay. Is he an engineer or.

### You (2025-09-05T18:37:48.374Z)

So. Yeah, Vinodis are. He was a senior engineer at Berkadia. He started at Berkadia and then moved over to redIQ.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:37:57.254Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:38:02.934Z)

He was actually working with Stephen on the reset. Project. And then. So when he was one of the few engineers that went to Radix when. When Radix bought him. So he's with us now. He has.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:38:22.454Z)

In the what, an east coast as well, or.

### You (2025-09-05T18:38:24.214Z)

Yeah, he's actually in the Philadelphia area, which is, you know, when he was with Berkadia He does have. He's the one I mentioned when last time we called it. He does have a little bit of design experience. So he's put together something. I mean, it looks nice. It's not a bad website. We just need to put some content in it. And I think he's using the blue and green logo that was part of the package that I sent to you. But anyway, he's the one that actually built it.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:39:04.134Z)

Yeah. So if he supports webcam for now, then I can just do the logo and from showers then too, so that's not a problem. I think we can also plan to meet even for 15 minutes every single week to just check in on work. It doesn't have to be too long, but to just quickly talk through issues, recap what has been done because on anything and get any new updates from you. So I think, yeah, I think we can start there and then we can keep on discussing Nicks. But in terms of compensation structure, I gave it some thought and would be open to an hourly rate of $30 an hour and a little bit of equity. If you think that what makes sense that way, I'm in if in the long run with you guys too. But if limited on funds like, perhaps we can cap it at, like, 5 to 10 hours per week to start.

### You (2025-09-05T18:40:02.454Z)

Yeah. Send me something. You know, because we're definitely gonna want to use you. But the question is. Yeah. How much do we need? You might even do better on a project base. But I've done that in the past as a consultant, and it's really difficult to really nail down exactly how many hours. If you underestimate, then you lose money. If you overestimate, good for you, bad for us. I mean, yeah, you know, we can. We can go with hourly. We can go with Project. There's all sorts of alternatives.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:40:45.254Z)

Yeah, I'm flexible and open to thoughts on this, too.

### You (2025-09-05T18:40:49.654Z)

The only thing I can tell you is. Equity would probably be not an option until you come on full time.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:41:01.414Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:41:01.894Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:41:02.454Z)

That's fine.

### You (2025-09-05T18:41:03.014Z)

Yeah. You can't give equity to non employees, right? So. But, yeah, that. I mean, that was. That would be something we anticipate to be. Part of anybody's. Any employees starting package. And, you know, I'm not. I'm not gonna lie. I mean, I would love to be able to bring you on full time.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:41:26.854Z)

Yeah. I mean, that's fine. Like, an hourly rate is different for me as well, right?

### You (2025-09-05T18:41:30.454Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:41:31.654Z)

Now.

### You (2025-09-05T18:41:32.374Z)

All right. Yeah, shoot me an email. So the other thing is, I do agree. You and I, we can have a weekly meeting, even if it's just a 15 minute catch up. But you will probably be working more directly with Mark Gordon. He is. The one that I told you is the broker. The hotel broker and developer of the five. So he is a salesperson. He is a marketer. As a broker, right? Not as like what you do so, but since he will be the one that will be meeting with investors and clients. You know, we want to make sure that he takes the lead, at least on whatever it is that you put together.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:42:27.494Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-09-05T18:42:30.774Z)

I very much that he would be, you know, like, what I'm doing. Looking up colors and things like that.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:42:37.974Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-05T18:42:39.654Z)

He will be hands on in terms of the content, which is fair enough. That's. That's really what he needs to do, so.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:42:49.654Z)

Okay. And when is the conferences coming up for you guys?

### You (2025-09-05T18:42:55.814Z)

I believe the first one is the first week of October. Towards the end of the week, for some reason I'm thinking, like the sixth or the seventh is something I've heard. So let me. Try to schedule a call with you and Mark. Next week. He's based. He's. He's in new york. So Eastern time zone as well. So if you want to use my calendar link, And block off maybe two or three times. That you're available, and then I'll get with Mark and see if he's available any of those three times. And then that that might be the quickest and easiest way to do it.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:43:49.974Z)

Okay, I just clicked on the link in the email. This is. The booking page is not found.

### You (2025-09-05T18:43:56.774Z)

Oh, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:43:59.254Z)

A different email.

### You (2025-09-05T18:44:01.254Z)

Let me double check on it. Because I know you. You used it to set up this call. Are you talking about? The link that's in my signature.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:44:15.254Z)

Yeah. In your email signature.

### You (2025-09-05T18:44:17.974Z)

Okay, let me double check and see.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:44:31.094Z)

Okay, I think the LinkedIn one is working now, so I can just schedule something on LinkedIn.

### You (2025-09-05T18:44:36.134Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:44:36.294Z)

I mean, the link on LinkedIn is working, but the link on your email signage is not working.

### You (2025-09-05T18:44:43.494Z)

Interesting, okay. I'm wondering if it changed and I updated one and not the other. That could be okay. Thank you for pointing that out.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:44:55.014Z)

Yeah, no worries.

### You (2025-09-05T18:44:56.374Z)

So, yeah, if you can just walk off a few times, and then I'll. I'll coordinate it with. With Mark. We have to have an intro call, and we'll. We'll go from there.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:05.334Z)

Okay, sounds good. All right. Thanks, Howard.

### You (2025-09-05T18:45:08.854Z)

Anything else.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:12.534Z)

Just setting up the call with Mark.

### You (2025-09-05T18:45:14.854Z)

Okay? I put. I put the web page URL in in the meeting chat. So if you want to just take a look at the website.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:27.334Z)

Yeah, I actually took a peek at it before our call. One page.

### You (2025-09-05T18:45:31.334Z)

I guess I'm stood. I thought you said you didn't. Or you wanted to. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:37.094Z)

Oh, no, I was just curious who was managing it and if I would be involved in helping with the website creation as well.

### You (2025-09-05T18:45:45.014Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:46.134Z)

But thank you. Also on my side, but have a great weekend and I'll block some time off.

### You (2025-09-05T18:45:52.134Z)

Right. One more. One more quick question, because it did come up in our weekly call. Diane updated everybody and, you know, she was very excited about the call.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:45:52.774Z)

The speaker.

### You (2025-09-05T18:46:03.414Z)

And somebody did ask and it might have been Vinod. If you do have experience in building websites, is that something. Would you just want to provide ideas and guidance or are you able to actually get into the website and and work on it?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:46:22.214Z)

I don't have website experience per se, but I can definitely help with the design ing part and give feedback.

### You (2025-09-05T18:46:28.614Z)

Okay? Okay? That's what I told him. I. But I said.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:46:32.454Z)

Yeah, and I'm privy to, like, AI Tools as well. Like, lovable. Do you guys have the subscription?

### You (2025-09-05T18:46:36.694Z)

Yeah. Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:46:41.094Z)

Lovable. Okay? That would be perfect for us.

### You (2025-09-05T18:46:42.134Z)

Yeah. I felt our entire. I built our entire poc in lovable. Yeah, I've been using a bunch of other ones, too. That's just one of the many. So. But, yeah, if you've. If you've used that, that would be very helpful because it generates the code. We could just hand that code over to the development team. And they'll probably have to make a few tweaks, but, yeah, I mean, that would. That would definitely be good.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:47:09.414Z)

Yeah. Then, yeah, I can help using it from there as well.

### You (2025-09-05T18:47:12.374Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:47:13.974Z)

Okay, sounds good.

### You (2025-09-05T18:47:15.574Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:47:16.054Z)

Excited.

### You (2025-09-05T18:47:17.254Z)

Yeah, yeah. Glad we can work Put work together again. So. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:47:22.934Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-05T18:47:23.574Z)

I will talk to you sometime next week when we can coordinate with Mark.

### Guest (2025-09-05T18:47:28.374Z)
