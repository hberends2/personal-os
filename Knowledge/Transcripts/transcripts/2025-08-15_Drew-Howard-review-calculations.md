# Transcript for: Drew | Howard: review calculations

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:00:58.550Z)

Howard.

### You (2025-08-15T17:00:59.510Z)

Hey, good morning. How you doing?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:01:03.110Z)

How are you?

### You (2025-08-15T17:01:03.510Z)

Good. Happy Friday.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:01:06.070Z)

Yeah. I finally got the two things that were completely overwhelming. My schedule finished. Now much relieved and free to pick the upwork on some of the things that I know you guys are waiting on me for.

### You (2025-08-15T17:01:23.030Z)

Yeah. Cool. Question for you. I know you're in California, but I never knew where. Are located.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:01:31.910Z)

I'm in inglewood.

### You (2025-08-15T17:01:33.030Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:01:35.670Z)

So sort of la. I'm literally like a mile from sofa. Stadium. Big stadium.

### You (2025-08-15T17:01:42.070Z)

Yeah. I used to get out to Costa Mesa a lot. With the previous job. And my son did an internship. Right there on the border of Studio City in Beverly Hills.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:02:00.790Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:02:02.630Z)

He got his degree in digital sound engineering and wanted to get involved with any type of movie sound stage. So it was the studio that did the spongebob soundtrack audio, amongst other things.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:02:18.710Z)

Interesting, okay.

### You (2025-08-15T17:02:23.510Z)

He was right down there in the heart for quite a while. But, yeah, I'd spent a lot of time in Orange County. But never really got up to LA proper that often. Just kind of dropped him off when he moved in and went and picked him up when he moved out.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:02:41.750Z)

Yeah. It's a remarkably large. People say la, but it could be four hours from where one person means and where the other means, so it's a big point.

### You (2025-08-15T17:02:54.870Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I remember one time I was down there on business, and he was there, and so we wanted to get together for dinner. And we started chatting about, like, what in the afternoon, trying to find a place like, that was right in between. And we found a place that was about 20 minutes for each of us, 20, 25. Then all of a sudden, it's 45. Then an hour and ten.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:03:26.230Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:03:26.630Z)

It's like the closer you get to 5:00 and I think it took him an hour and a half, and it took me about 45 minutes to get there. It's just nuts.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:03:36.710Z)

It can be a nightmare.

### You (2025-08-15T17:03:37.430Z)

Yeah, yeah. Well, cool. I'm going to share my screen. This can actually be fairly fast. I just want some clarification. On some of these settings. In some of the comments you said. So do you see the document now? Okay. All right. So the first thing is I wanted to make sure that everybody had the right perspective, that this is for the engineers.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:04:10.550Z)

Yes, I agree.

### You (2025-08-15T17:04:11.510Z)

So when they're putting it together, a question like this. I wasn't quite clear when you said, should we say distribution from property? There isn't really a distribution from Property Row. In anything that we've got right now, so.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:04:30.630Z)

Yeah, so I meant more. If a property. Has a net operating loss for a long enough period of time.

### You (2025-08-15T17:04:44.790Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:04:45.510Z)

And therefore it needs a capital call.

### You (2025-08-15T17:04:49.350Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:04:49.430Z)

From the owner. The owner is going to have to invest some amount, right? So that becomes. I mean, I guess it's a negative cash flow, but it also means an investment.

### You (2025-08-15T17:04:59.990Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:05:01.110Z)

Additional investment.

### You (2025-08-15T17:05:02.150Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:05:02.470Z)

So I just wanted to make sure that was if all the cash flows are always positive and always just distributing money to the owner, that would just be positive cash flow.

### You (2025-08-15T17:05:11.590Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:05:12.150Z)

Positive Noi then it's pretty straightforward, right? Like owner invests capital. They get money back. Throughout the ownership lifecycle, and then at the very end, they get to big lump sum. But if there are periods in there where there's a net operating loss, For enough of a period that the property can't just cover it with its own cash. Then the owner will have to do a capital call, which it becomes, right? Like a negative on the cash flow side.

### You (2025-08-15T17:05:42.550Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:05:43.670Z)

But that means there's also an investment from the owner. So I wanted to make sure that that was properly articulated, because I think it could otherwise. I don't know how to get accounted for.

### You (2025-08-15T17:05:55.190Z)

Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. We go down to the Capex. Expenditures, but we don't really have anything else that's typically below the line for any other type of.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:06:09.430Z)

Right. So it doesn't need to be right. Like if it was on this section.

### You (2025-08-15T17:06:11.110Z)

Ingestion.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:06:15.430Z)

It would just be a negative net operating income. That would just be it. Right. Like if you had and send the properties renovating. A lot of business goes away. They still have a lot of expenses, right? So you might have a net operating. Loss for a couple, for a year or a few months or whatever. So that would just be a negative noi on that page, which is showing. I think the negative noi would show up in the same spot right there. Where says it a lot. But then there would need to be.

### You (2025-08-15T17:06:45.910Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It would have to be something in here. I don't know if it would be in the debt or if we put it up here as. I mean, it wouldn't necessarily be an acquisition cost.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:07:01.990Z)

Yeah, it's not an acquisitions cost. It is an investment. So it could go in that row. Because it is coming from the same source. And it's the same thing, basically.

### You (2025-08-15T17:07:15.190Z)

Yeah, I think we could maybe. Leave it. Acquisition. Maybe there'd be another row in here somewhere below.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:07:26.710Z)

If we wanted to make it its own row. Usually what people are going to call it is a capital call.

### You (2025-08-15T17:07:30.790Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:07:32.790Z)

That's going to be. The term that people are familiar with.

### You (2025-08-15T17:07:38.390Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:07:39.510Z)

So. It may be worth making it its own realm.

### You (2025-08-15T17:07:45.990Z)

I'm familiar with capital calls. Typically on the multifamily side, it's always below capex.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:07:54.630Z)

Then that would work too.

### You (2025-08-15T17:07:57.030Z)

So I'm just wondering. First off, we don't have a place for it now, so we'll have to keep that in mind. For future.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:08:05.190Z)

Yeah. Again, it's a less common occurrence.

### You (2025-08-15T17:08:05.350Z)

Revision. Less. Current.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:08:11.590Z)

Right, but I just wanted to ensure that it is accounted for. And again. And all the comments I put there were tended to make things clearer for the engineers.

### You (2025-08-15T17:08:21.190Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:08:21.830Z)

So even the question may not have been clear to the engineers. But the question was intended for us to clarify the text so that it was clear for the engineers.

### You (2025-08-15T17:08:29.030Z)

Okay? All right. And then cash on cash. That's coming from. The investment summary page. Does this also need exit proceeds. So I believe we do have that. If I go back.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:08:57.030Z)

Yeah, I think that it was because it said just cash flows. I wasn't sure if cash flows included.

### You (2025-08-15T17:09:01.990Z)

Okay? Yeah, because we're calculating on an annual basis.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:09:08.390Z)

It looks like it does.

### You (2025-08-15T17:09:10.550Z)

Yeah. It does. But these are also. False fake numbers. So it doesn't dial right. I mean, nobody's going to go with a negative 875.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:09:17.030Z)

Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, but that number is big enough that it suggests it's including the Disposition XL price.

### You (2025-08-15T17:09:23.910Z)

Yeah. It's including the exit and then calculating an average over here. And of course, see, the number up here doesn't even tie. Okay. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:09:39.110Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:09:44.790Z)

And this is what I really wanted to talk about. Is the difference between Noi and gop? I just wanted to make sure that for all of these items down here. Want to make sure that either. Are we discussing the noi as it is in the pro forma page? So down here you've got the noi. Which is after ebitda and non operating expenses, insurance, taxes. Where would your debt payments. Go. On here?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:10:33.510Z)

They are not on here.

### You (2025-08-15T17:10:34.550Z)

No. Would they typically be below noi, or would they be reserv?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:10:38.630Z)

Correct. Yeah. They're below. It's a little confusing and I'll share something on my screen. Here.

### You (2025-08-15T17:10:49.590Z)

Ed. That's how it is in multifamily as well. The debt service is always below noi. I just wanted to make sure.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:10:57.350Z)

Yeah. And it's confusing to us because we use this net operating income. For Noi, which that's actually, according to the Usali. That is not what you're supposed to call it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:11:09.030Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:11:10.550Z)

And this is the 11th edition. The 12th edition just came out this year, but it didn't change that much. So this is what hotel PNLs are supposed to look like, right?

### You (2025-08-15T17:11:18.950Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:11:22.150Z)

So operating departments where you have your revenues. Distribute, then your departmental expenses that correspond to the revenues.

### You (2025-08-15T17:11:29.110Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:11:29.750Z)

Your undistributed admin Int. Sales Marketing, right? And then that gets you to gop. And then you have management fees. And then you have your non operating income and expenses. Which include lease income or TAM expenses, equipment rentals. Copiers, cars, that sort of thing, property taxes, insurance, other. And then you have. And that gets you to ebitda. Ebitda. And if we didn't have this reserve for replacement requirement, then we would probably use the term EBITDA more regularly. But because all properties have a replacement required, you have to contribute some amount to your reserve.

### You (2025-08-15T17:12:08.470Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:12:12.710Z)

The ebitda doesn't really mean anything. So people don't really use it. So ebitda less ffne is the proper term for what this is supposed to be. But everybody just calls it NOI because that's what it was called in the 10th and 9th and 8th editions of East Sally. And that doesn't include any interest payments.

### You (2025-08-15T17:12:31.350Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:12:35.990Z)

Debt service, depreciation, amortization, anything like that. Right. All the stuff that you would think of as below. EBITDA is not included in the noi, so that's why it's net operating income. And then there would be a separate. Right. Now, this one is, if you look at this one, says the operating statement for operators. And this one says operating for owners. They're identical, except that when you get to this last line, Then there's added interest, depreciation, amortization and interest expenses.

### You (2025-08-15T17:13:08.870Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:13:10.310Z)

And then that gets you to do net income, which, again, very confusing because they're so similar net income versus net operating income.

### You (2025-08-15T17:13:13.110Z)

Yeah. But yeah, same thing in multifamily. Okay, so that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:13:22.230Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:13:24.550Z)

All right, so if I go back to the document, All right, So I just want to make sure. Just confirm. So, exit cap rate. Would be the noi divided by the sales price.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:13:45.990Z)

Yeah. And my comment there was really just to make sure that, because I think that Mark and Diane had mentioned this, that there's sometimes. Confusion. Or like, sometimes people, I guess, use ebitda. Sometimes they use EBITDA less ffne. But I think per what I was looking up and what Mark and Diana said, it's supposed to be ebitda, SSNE or noi. Right. So I just wanted to be extra clear exactly what that is, so. It doesn't get confused with engineers doing it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:14:01.830Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay? All right. So then your next question. Let me see. Was. Does this include closing costs?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:14:31.990Z)

And that's a question I don't actually genuinely don't know. Somebody might have to email Diana Mark, because they're more familiar. With doing actual deals and calculating these things than I am.

### You (2025-08-15T17:14:47.270Z)

Yes, it does. Because in this example, we're saying the exit cap is 7%, and then it's deducting 3% for sales expense. And so net sales proceeds. And then for unlevered and levered. Well, wait, so no, I guess.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:15:11.990Z)

Feeling like I could probably pull up one of my old models here and maybe look at it and see what it does.

### You (2025-08-15T17:15:14.710Z)

Yes. Okay, so in this case, the purchase price is not.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:15:20.390Z)

I feel like the purchase price is. Yeah. Does not include any of that. You buy the property for 50 million. That's the purchase price. And whatever you pay on top of that.

### You (2025-08-15T17:15:20.470Z)

Include. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:15:31.430Z)

Whatever. The cost of the deal.

### You (2025-08-15T17:15:35.350Z)

And you're projecting out into the future. For this. Is the acquisition? I was looking at the exit. But same thing, same thing. You've got your purchase price and then you've got it broken down into those different lines. The Caprician and the exit would be based on the purchase price. Not net.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:15:58.870Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:16:02.070Z)

Same thing here. Okay? Yes. And we talked about Diane mentioned in there. Whether it's based on the T12 or the F12. Right now. It's just based on the trailing twelve.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:16:22.390Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:16:24.790Z)

Your noi at the exit year. But we can easily put in a trigger. What do you want to have it based on? And you could have a little radio button that says T12 Future. And of course, this is basing everything on annual calendar years. So there's nothing in the model right now. For uploading a monthly financial statement. And I know. I think we need to do that. I don't know if it has to be there for the MVP or.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:17:07.030Z)

I mentioned this to Vinod that it doesn't need to. People are not going to look at the month by month data very frequently because when you do underwriting.

### You (2025-08-15T17:17:15.830Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:17:18.230Z)

Generally always at the annual level.

### You (2025-08-15T17:17:20.150Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:17:22.710Z)

But when it comes to the current year, and this is what I responded to, your question, Earlier this week about the forecast versus T12, right? For the current year. You're getting multiple versions of. You're going to get 12 sets of financial reports. For the current year that are going to have one more month of actuals. And then either. If it's a T12, right? It just moved to T12, up one month. If it's a forecast. It's one more month of actuals and an updated forecast.

### You (2025-08-15T17:17:53.750Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:17:55.270Z)

Right. So at the end, at the end of the year, you get the final one that's locked in and then you move to the next year. So when users are uploading data or when data is getting uploaded, Aside from the data coming from hotel bs. I mean, for data coming from a broker or a deal room. Right. From a seller. Sometimes they'll provide the data that has the full year with the forecast. Sometimes they'll provide like a T12. Sometimes they'll just provide, like a year to date.

### You (2025-08-15T17:18:28.630Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:18:30.630Z)

So it doesn't need to show the month by month. But I think the user needs to know. What that current year number is.

### You (2025-08-15T17:18:39.110Z)

Yeah. So. Same thing in multifamily. Although it's very rarely a T12, it's almost always year to date.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:18:51.350Z)

Yeah, that's the same.

### You (2025-08-15T17:18:53.270Z)

We just annualize that number, but it doesn't typically factor in any type of seasonality. There is some seasonality in multifamily, but probably not anywhere near what you have in a hotel.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:19:11.430Z)

Oh, yeah, there's a ton of seasonality. In hotels, but as long as you're capturing a 12 month period, it doesn't matter.

### You (2025-08-15T17:19:18.230Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:19:19.350Z)

So that's why a lot of the underwriting models, if they're getting for 20, 25, like right now. Gelato, was it? July reporting is coming out which has July year to date. All the reports will have July year to date this year, and they'll have July year to date last year. And so you just do. I think it's like last full calendar year. Plus July year to date this year minus July to date last year gets you at T12.

### You (2025-08-15T17:19:48.470Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:19:49.110Z)

That's basically. Basically what people do. And then that's what they put into the current year slot. Right. Just saying.

### You (2025-08-15T17:19:58.630Z)

So we don't need to worry about annualizing. Year to date data. Maybe table it, I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:20:12.150Z)

I mean. I think if it's possible to not annualize it, but to convert it to a T12. That would be useful.

### You (2025-08-15T17:20:27.670Z)

Okay? Yeah, I'm just wondering.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:20:30.470Z)

Because.

### You (2025-08-15T17:20:36.230Z)

At run iq, we were used to getting sometimes very little historical data. It might just be year to date. You may not have prior year data to do that.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:20:42.870Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:20:48.550Z)

But it doesn't sound to me like in hotels that that's very common. If at all.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:20:55.110Z)

No, you're generally going to get data.

### You (2025-08-15T17:20:57.030Z)

Okay, right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:20:59.030Z)

Unless it's a new development, right?

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:00.550Z)

All right, so that's probably falls into the don't worry about it until somebody brings it up bucket.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:08.390Z)

Yeah, well, I've mentioned. Let's see if I can find it in one of these models.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:19.430Z)

I mean, we can always know. What you said about annualizing or backing into a T12 like that. I'm just wondering if. How common is it that we just get only a year to date? Financial saving.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:33.590Z)

No. You'll almost always get additional years. Like for any deal, you're probably going to get five years of history.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:36.070Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:40.070Z)

So you'll get five full calendar years.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:42.550Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:42.950Z)

That's it. It's just the one thing for the full calendar year. But then for the current year, you'll probably get a year to date.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:46.950Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:52.390Z)

Pnkl.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:52.710Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:21:53.350Z)

Maybe a T12, maybe a forecast. Maybe you'll get all three.

### You (2025-08-15T17:21:58.150Z)

Well, that was a good. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:22:03.830Z)

And then you're going to get multiple versions of them. Right? Because the deal doesn't happen in a month. Might take three, four, five months. So every month you're going to get a new set of financials. That are going to get published and that the user is probably going to load in and want to be like, okay. How does the property do? Compared to what they said they were going to do or what the forecast was. And do I need to update my underwriting accordingly?

### You (2025-08-15T17:22:29.270Z)

Yeah. All right, so that kind of answers my question is. If you do get a financial statement that has year to date actuals and then. The remaining year budget. Or forecast. Do the buyers typically rely on the seller's forecaster budget, or do they go in there and they tweak numbers at all?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:22:57.110Z)

It's usually a reference point. And then they'll adjust to their own current year.

### You (2025-08-15T17:23:04.790Z)

Yeah. All right, so we need to think about this, because the proof of concept. And probably the MVP are assuming calendar years. So if we get a 2025 operating statement through August, We don't have any way of adjusting September through December. We would basically take whatever is on that operating statement.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:23:40.070Z)

It would just get loaded in. I know in the poc right now. 2,020, 2,021, 22, 23, 24, 25, and then 26, 27, 28, 29. And I can't recall. I guess up till 25 current year. Is provided, and then starting with 26 is where you're going to start inputting. I mean, so. Unless you buy the hotel on January 1st. Right? Or December 31st. There's always, like, a stub year, right? There's always, like, some amount. Which. Different models do it different ways. But in order to. I guess, in order to really correctly calculate. Your returns.

### You (2025-08-15T17:24:39.830Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:24:41.910Z)

You need to factor that in. It needs to be included.

### You (2025-08-15T17:24:44.870Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:24:46.310Z)

So. It's kind of complicated to explain.

### You (2025-08-15T17:24:52.550Z)

No, I understand. We've been through this before, but, yes, for the poc, it was overly simplified. Assuming that you bought the deal on January 1st of 2025. Right. So we had all the historical. And then from day one of 2025, Is where we're forecasting. So to do this is not difficult. It would basically. Require another page. Where we would upload a monthly. Financial statement for the current year. And then allow the user to go through. Make changes to the line, just like they would with the current forecasting. So they can do. They can tweak the occupancy if they want to. It would be identical to the forecasting, but then you could go to then the valuation or the pro forma. And then you'd have all the way through year to date. Then you can start working on the whole period. Just the way that the POC is now. So we just need to get something for the year to date. Or the current year, but that's going to require 13 columns. So putting that on the same page as the pro forma. Is possible. But that's going to have scrolling across.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:26:30.790Z)

Well. I think this is, like, one of the things I provided previously just for penetration analysis, but I realized. That this didn't include. I think maybe should be included or maybe another way to do it is just the current year is both. I guess you were. Do it like this. Right, so the current. Year is sort of used twice. As like, here's whatever we have for the current year, and here's what you project for the current year. So it doesn't need to be done. It doesn't need to be done. Monthly. Right. But you can at least get some reference point as to what's. And then this doesn't need to ever get like all the year over year calculations and all of that. They don't use this. They go from your projection to your last year of actual because this current year. Is sort of a. It could be a budget, right? Like, if it's, if it's November, if it's like, you know, October, November, December, you'll have a budget for 2026. So you might put a budget in here, but your budget could be, I mean. You can use it, but again, it's like, who knows how accurate.

### You (2025-08-15T17:28:17.510Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:28:19.750Z)

Is.

### You (2025-08-15T17:28:22.310Z)

So without doing a monthly breakdown. How would. They go from the 2025 year to date to the 2025. Projected.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:28:38.550Z)

I think. The way I did it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:28:43.670Z)

Thank you.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:28:44.550Z)

Is. Because you're projecting most things. On a occupancy adr rev.

### You (2025-08-15T17:28:54.630Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:28:54.710Z)

Par. You're not doing, like, a whole number. You're putting in 82%, 83%, whatever it is.

### You (2025-08-15T17:29:03.350Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:29:06.950Z)

If you prorate the number of days, like the whole. If you say this property is going to close, On August 1st. Then you can say how many days are left in the year. It's whatever. Five months. That's 150 days or whatever it is, right?

### You (2025-08-15T17:29:26.790Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:29:27.270Z)

Multiply it by your room count. To get your available rooms. And then you can just recalculate. How much revenue is that? What are the expenses? And all the way down to the bottom line.

### You (2025-08-15T17:29:42.340Z)

Okay. All right, that makes sense. Okay. That'd be way easier than having to pull in a monthly statement and then go month by month to project it.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:29:53.110Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:29:53.540Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:29:53.910Z)

And I think, I mean, I would. Yeah. And I get worried about doing a monthly saving because maybe we don't get it right. And then that limits help. So I think this way, if you just, if you have. Kind of a standalone column for current year, which could be. It could be the forecast, it could be the budget, it could be year to date, T12, whatever we get. And just the annualized number, and then the user can reproject their current year. Based, you know, benefits again, year over year growth is still going to be based on 2024. It's just they can use the 2025 as a reference. And then in order to recalculate the whole dollar value of, like, what is profit from the start of the actual hold period, You just forrate the number of days in the year left. And recalculate everything based on available rooms.

### You (2025-08-15T17:30:44.900Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:30:46.550Z)

Does that make sense?

### You (2025-08-15T17:30:47.460Z)

Yeah. So how do you account for the days after? The closing date, would that then fall into your 2026? Let me just put it this way. So we've got 20, 25. And let's just say it's July 31st. So I've got seven months of actuals. And then I've got the four months, and I'm expecting to close on October 15th. So what do we do for the remaining. For those, what, 10 weeks of the year between October 16th and December 31st. Where does that get accounted for?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:31:39.750Z)

Well, that's what you're recalculating with the number of days in the year. Let me.

### You (2025-08-15T17:31:45.140Z)

Oh. So the number of days in the year. That doesn't depend on the closing date. Right? So you're saying the number of days left in the year would be.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:31:53.510Z)

Yeah. Anyway based on the closing date. Right? Like, if I'm going to close on October one, then you have whatever October's got 31.

### You (2025-08-15T17:32:01.140Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:32:06.550Z)

Plus 30 plus 31. You have 92 days left.

### You (2025-08-15T17:32:09.460Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:32:10.710Z)

And you know that the hotel has. However many rooms that it has. Right? It has, you know, 150 rooms. Then basically. With that, you can. The user can still just project 82%, right? Like, they don't have to. They don't have to change the way they're thinking about their annualized projections.

### You (2025-08-15T17:32:37.140Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:32:37.830Z)

Because it's all on a. It's all on a por occupancy, you know, basis. And you can just recalculate the whole dollar value by using the number of days and the left of the year. Right? So with this, I can say I know that if there's 92 days left of the year, 150 rooms in the hotel. And that means there's 13,800 rooms available. Left in the year, and I'm going to factoring in. At an occupancy of 82%. That means I'm getting this many rooms sold. And that means at. This adr. I use the wrong thing. And at that adr. Here's my room revenue. It's 2.3 million in room revenue left for the rest of the year. Right. So that way, the last financial statement you should get from the seller would be for September 31st, the rest of the year. And it would be for whatever, however much they made that so far. And then your rest of year is going to be 2.3 million and all your other revenues and expenses. And then together they would make the full year. But as far as calculating returns, you're only going to use this much.

### You (2025-08-15T17:34:12.260Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:34:12.470Z)

Because the pro forma page. Doesn't really need to change much. It just needs that extra point of reference for a current year.

### You (2025-08-15T17:34:25.300Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:34:26.790Z)

And because users are putting everything in, for the most part, they're going to put it in on a por basis.

### You (2025-08-15T17:34:32.580Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:34:33.910Z)

Or you can recalculate the stub year. But then on that tab, that was like the summary tab, like the investment returns tab. That doesn't include any of the history. And you want it to start. The date of closing, which if it's October 1st, then year one, cash flow from the property is going to be small because only three months left. Right. And then the next year would be the full. You know, the subsequent years will all be full years.

### You (2025-08-15T17:35:06.020Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:35:08.870Z)

I think I have a model that does that. I just got to find it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:35:12.420Z)

Okay? So what you're showing now, then, is the 2025 year to date. And so for the last. Few days. That would be year one. And then 2026 would be year two.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:35:34.070Z)

Yeah. That's the way I think of it. And we can run this by Mark.

### You (2025-08-15T17:35:40.900Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:35:43.030Z)

Let me see. Here. We go. I think this is it. Okay, so this is a different model. It's similar, right?

### You (2025-08-15T17:35:52.660Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:35:53.750Z)

And here. The way this one was set up, if you send the opening date, Is like. Then. I didn't even do it here. Like I said, I didn't even do it here, but basically. You're putting in occupancy. ADR and all those things for the full year. And on the performance inputs you're putting in everything. So I said, Year one is full, year is. Year one is 2,025.

### You (2025-08-15T17:36:33.700Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:36:36.390Z)

But it's only five months. So I calculated number of days.

### You (2025-08-15T17:36:39.540Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:36:40.790Z)

Left. And then when I reach out, when you look at the whole dollar amount, which I don't think I did, basically, But when you recalculate the outputs with the dollar amount and the cash flows and all of that, Year one is only going to be a partial year. So it's going to be small numbers. And then year two, three, four, five of the four years.

### You (2025-08-15T17:37:05.380Z)

Okay? So. I do not have. Number of days in the year. Displayed. On the pro forma page. That was an oversight, assuming it was going to be 365, but obviously. Okay, so for partial years. All right. So we do need. We need an input for the closing date. We don't have that. And then we need to add the row for the number of days in the year based on the closing date. And that year would be year one. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:37:57.430Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:37:58.100Z)

All right, that makes sense. So, yeah, I can see how yours is showing there. Okay? So your rooms revenue. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:38:11.910Z)

Yeah. So this might not be. I don't.

### You (2025-08-15T17:38:15.460Z)

Right. I'm seeing. Okay? All right, that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:38:24.390Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:38:24.900Z)

Yeah. And we do need to have this for the mvp. So I need to work with Node on that.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:38:30.310Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:38:37.940Z)

Okay? So if I go back to this prd, then. So I think we're good there. So, same thing. Service coverage ratio would be the noi, not the gop. Pretty sure on that one.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:39:03.350Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:39:04.660Z)

Valuation.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:39:08.070Z)

And I didn't get to these. I only did the first section. So I don't have any additional comments? I don't think so. I got to go look through the rest of it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:39:10.660Z)

Okay? All right? Yeah. Let me just skim through real quick to see if any of these are. So purchase price cap rate. Yes. Year one. I know. I divided B cap rate. Acquisition cost doesn't have anything to do.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:39:32.230Z)

Wait. Go back, go back. Hold on real quick.

### You (2025-08-15T17:39:32.900Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:39:34.550Z)

Based on what we were just talking about, I think we need to make sure if something is year one.

### You (2025-08-15T17:39:39.460Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:39:40.230Z)

We're talking about year one cap rate. I guess. If year one is a stubbier. Then it needs to be a T12. Or it needs to be. I realize that adds a certain degree of complexity. When you're calculating these initial first year things. And that this is where it becomes, again, kind of confusing. Right? Because for the purchase price cap rate, If somebody calculating it based on the T12. So let's say I want to know what the cap rate is based on the T12 right up till the date I close. Or what's the cap rate based on the next 12? Like my first 12 months of ownership. Right. So that would be different. Or maybe I just want to know what's the cap rate based on the calendar year for 2025? Blending the pre acquisition and the post acquisition. So it does get a little confusing. And I don't know that all of those need to be in the mvp.

### You (2025-08-15T17:40:53.140Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:40:59.030Z)

But those will probably come up.

### You (2025-08-15T17:41:01.220Z)

Okay. All right. So discount cash flow. Doesn't require. Well, it does have the exit year, Noi. Let's see. So.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:41:15.590Z)

I think that's like, after. I've never seen anybody. Go as to say my sale date or my sell date. My disposition date is like July 1, 2029. I've never seen anyone do that. They just always assumed till the end of the year.

### You (2025-08-15T17:41:29.620Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:41:34.550Z)

This was significant.

### You (2025-08-15T17:41:35.220Z)

Yeah, okay. Acquisition cost good there purchase price. Estimated Capex reserve replacement. And again, just want to confirm. So the reserve for replacement is calculated on total revenue. Okay? Financing loan amount. I think this is all pretty much straightforward. I don't think there's anything here. Closing costs. We've got the two different ways. Of doing it. Either as a percentage of the loan or detailed. Amortization period, term equity. I think we're pretty good on that. Again. I think what was going on in my mind is that there's a difference in NOI between multifamily and hotels. And I just wanted to make sure that anything that I have in this document that says NOI really is NOI and not gop. And it seems like.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:42:42.230Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:42:50.580Z)

We're pretty good on that one.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:42:52.150Z)

Yeah. GOP is a very, very important metric for hotel performance. But when it comes to the real estate part of the business, I don't think it's used in any calculations.

### You (2025-08-15T17:43:05.300Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:43:06.070Z)

It's more of just like an operating benchmark. Because everything below GOP is taxes and insurance is pretty much fixed. You can't do a whole lot to change. It.

### You (2025-08-15T17:43:16.820Z)

All right, so exit cap rate. And exit year Noi Right now. It's based on the T12. So whatever my total noi is for. My last year in the hold period is what's being used to calculate the sale price. But Diane mentioned about the forward 12. Was that just for acquisition or. I was going to say, I can't imagine anybody would forecast a year 11 if they're selling in year 10.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:43:47.590Z)

Yeah, that's just for acquisition. Yeah. I've never seen that. It's just the acquisition year. That you have this difference in how people look at it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:44:02.260Z)

Okay? Sales expense all these profor. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I think we're good. So we've got some of the key metrics there, but I think these are all the same. The ADR. Total revenue. So I think we're good. That was the question there. So, yeah, if it's up to you, if you want to keep going through the document and if you have any other questions or comments, go ahead and put it in there.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:44:41.350Z)

Yeah, I was trying to take a look, especially at this section down here. This is the pro forma inputs and metrics.

### You (2025-08-15T17:44:46.900Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:44:47.750Z)

I'll give those look just a bit, because those I do know very, very well to make sure that they are clear to the engineers.

### You (2025-08-15T17:44:53.460Z)

Okay? All right. Actually, this entire section, the tabs, these are. The static metric tabs. Up at the top. So you've got your key metrics, occupancy, revenue and expense. And basically all of these are pulling from the data down here. So if everything down here is right, That hole. Section here you don't even have to really worry about for the tab.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:45:26.150Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-15T17:45:26.500Z)

Yeah, right here. So everything on this pro forma section are those. So you got your key metrics tab, then you've got your occupancy, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't think. Unless. If you find something up above, I'll make sure that it's reflected down here too, so they don't have any. Type of conflict there. And then the investment summary, same thing. I think we're good there because this is the data we've just been going over for some of these down here. So again, I'll make sure everything that we did up above ties down here.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:45:59.910Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:46:05.300Z)

We still do need to figure out what we would do for Capex. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:46:18.150Z)

And this is another. I'm just looking at this return metrics. Somebody when a group buys a property. There is a ffne reserve. That exists that's accumulated over their hold period. Market will know better as to whether I think what they said is when you buy a property, the seller is going to take the SFNE reserve with them. Whatever's left, they're going to take with them. And then you, as the new owner, are going to start a new ffne reserve. That means. If you're planning to do a big renovation. Then usually. The renovation is going to happen. It's not going to happen all at once, right? It happens over year one and two. Maybe one, two and three. So that capex amount. It might be funded from a loan. It might be funded. In addition to just like, what are you spending on Capex, there's the question of how is it funded? And that corresponds to the capital Call line as well, right? If you buy property for 50 million and you're putting in 20 million over the next three years. Maybe you increased the size of your loan to account for that, and the lender is going to distribute it to you so that you have no additional capital call. You just put in the 50 million and then that's it. Or maybe you like I had a property where they bought. They bought the ffne reserve when they bought the property. Then they had a big FFE reserve that they could draw down on to fund a huge renovation. Or the third scenario was if the seller takes the FFNE reserve with them, then you start from zero. And maybe you're going to fund those capex costs, you're going to fund them with a capital call. That would be the kind of the third way. So as I'm thinking about it more. It needs to be. It doesn't have to be. The way you have the pro forma tab set up is, I think, is good. What you're going to spend to renovate the rooms and the lobby and all that, that's the capital expenditure.

### You (2025-08-15T17:48:45.460Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:48:45.670Z)

But there needs to be a mechanism to determine how it's going to get funded. Because that could impact the cash flows. If there is a capital call.

### You (2025-08-15T17:48:56.420Z)

Okay? All right. That makes sense. So maybe down in that Capex section we account for.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:49:04.710Z)

Yeah, the way that.

### You (2025-08-15T17:49:06.420Z)

Reserve.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:49:08.150Z)

The way that some of the reports that I used to update when I was an asset manager would be basically, what's the FFNE balance? What's the FF and E reserve balance? This month. It's $5 million. And we contributed to contributing every month. Based on percentage of revenue, right? So maybe you're contributing. 150,000. And then you withdrew 50,000 because you spent it on something. Right. So what's your new capex balance? What's your new ffe reserve balance? And then what's your cash flow for the FFNE reserve? Because as you're spending on the renovation, You need to make sure that if you're trying not to spend any more money, basically trying not to do a capital call, You have to time your cash flows. Such that. You don't over commit on the renovation and not have enough money to pay for it.

### You (2025-08-15T17:50:06.420Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:50:06.550Z)

From the FNA user, so I've seen whole reports dedicated to just that analysis. I don't know if we need to get that. Like that. That's a monthly type of analysis, right?

### You (2025-08-15T17:50:20.980Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:50:21.990Z)

So I don't know if it needs to be something. I mean, ideally, eventually it would be something that we could do inside the model. You could do it. This model could tell you, oh, you're looking to spend. 10 million over the next three years. Well, you're not going to have enough. But I think right now, for the sake of. I guess maybe let me email Mark and I and I'll copy you on it because I think there's a lot of ways they could go, one could go about it, but I think there's a simplest and most common route that we could use and they could easily flag to users.

### You (2025-08-15T17:50:47.140Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:51:00.470Z)

It could flatter them if they're over committing on the renovation. So I'll copy you in what my email to them and.

### You (2025-08-15T17:51:07.060Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:51:10.310Z)

In response.

### You (2025-08-15T17:51:10.500Z)

So just as an FYI. Shouldn't say long term. The midterm plan is that we could potentially have. Three different models. And what we have today would be good for the lenders because they don't need to get into the detail like the food and beverage and then breaking it down in the different categories. At least that's my understanding. The second version, then could be for the brokers and investors. Where on that property. Details. The second tab. You've got all the boxes to check for what other revenue and expenses you'd have where then you could break it down. And the idea then was to only include the inputs on the pro forma page. That you need. Based on what you check there. So if you don't have food and beverage, We don't need a row for food and beverage. But then the third one would be for asset management, and so that would be from the day you get the information from the broker through acquisition, and then you've got your hold period. But at that point, that's where we want to include the ability to upload a budget and look at it monthly. Now, every financial statement can do a budget versus actual. But we also have the pro forma, right? So every year, the budget's going to change. But I know from an asset management standpoint in multifamily, we not only wanted to take a look at how are we doing against budget, but how are we doing against our original performer. And that is something we probably then would want to have somewhere within the model, the ability to see a year. With each individual month. Right. So every month, they would upload that next month's operating statement. And that's also where in. In Red iq, we actually gave the users three different options. But we didn't name them, so we just called it, you know, pro forma one, performer two, and perform a three. They can put in their own custom names, but we figured, you know, they're going to want to input a budget. We already have the original underwriting, so they could also do, like, what if? Or, you know, different scenario type of analysis. But again, for that, you kind of have to have a monthly breakdown. So that's probably where, like I mentioned earlier, maybe we have a separate page. For the asset management. And maybe use that accordion. Functionality. So I can either take a look at 2025 annually, or I can push the button, have 2025 expand, and I can see each month, I can go in there and make changes, etc. Without having to jump back and forth between a multitab and an annual tab and everything like that. So does that make sense?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:54:18.310Z)

Yeah, let me. You know, I was actually just talking with somebody yesterday. And one of our hotel BIS customers. A lot of them do that quarterly valuation, like Mark to market.

### You (2025-08-15T17:54:32.100Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:54:33.590Z)

Update, which I think multifamily does as well. But there's one guy at Sunstone who handles that. And the guy was talking yesterday. Said he's very knowledgeable. How that. How Sunstone. Anyway, looks at that. I don't know if they look at it annually or monthly. Quarterly, so it might be good. I can maybe reach out to him and set up a call and explain what we're doing. And we can get some feedback from him. I think when I was at my last company, I did it monthly. Which. But I don't know if that's how common that is. I don't know. I think I might have been also doing other things in that same model, like looking at cap. Like looking at your ffne. Draw and debt service coverage ratio, and I was doing a lot all in one model, so it had to be monthly. But maybe it doesn't need to be. But, yeah, I think to your point about multiple models, Yeah, I think there is. I mean, I think one of the things we originally talked about is, like, the model we have now and then the ability to add, like, a Berkadia tab for SMB or Breakout tab. For other operating departments or ANG or something like that. Which would be, I guess, if we did it that way, would there still be multiple models?

### You (2025-08-15T17:55:54.500Z)

No, when I say multiple models. That would be behind the scenes. When the user logs in and uses it, it would look the same. Right. So if you've got a lender or somebody who doesn't want to underwrite other revenue or other expenses, if they don't check a box, it's not going to be there. Right. So they can still go through the property details because there is that none option on there as well. So it doesn't have to be an actual. You're not going to see lender model at the top of the page or investor model right there. So it's just kind of the way that we think about it. Asset management. I don't think it would be a separate model. But we would want to have that additional functionality of maybe if they want to take a look at it monthly and have that separate budget versus actual versus pro forma different levels. That can all be done. Behind the scenes. I'm not sure if you're familiar. Are you familiar with feature flags in software? What? The term is, okay? So basically what we will be doing is a feature flag is where in our. Our administrative. Tool that we would use internally for the customers. It's a way that you can either that you can provide additional features. But not have to have a different model. Like here's a model base plus other revenue base plus other revenue, plus this. Right? So other revenue or all of these different features. Like when we get to the AI features, we're going to want to have add ons. Right. When I submitted that pricing, there's like the base model. There's base plus this and those. Feature flags are what determines that. It's just. It's just a checkbox, right? So I would go in and say, okay, Drew's company, they've got the base model, but they also have this, right? So there may be. Maybe. Maybe we would have an asset management upgrade. That would introduce all these additional features over and above. Just a simple underwriting tool. And so that means whoever our administrator is just goes into the account and checks that box. And then when you log in, You've got access to all those deals. So that's kind of what I mean. It's not really like three different models, because the last thing you want to have to do is if there's change, right. Going to three different tunnels and make that change.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:58:44.950Z)

Yeah. Update. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-15T17:58:49.940Z)

But, yeah, it would all be handled via the feature flags, and so we could control it that way.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:58:57.270Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-15T17:58:59.460Z)

All right, cool. This has been very helpful. Appreciate all the clarification. That document that had all of the standards. You said it was the 11th edition or whatever. It looked familiar. Is that uploaded into the team site?

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:59:20.230Z)

Yes, I believe so.

### You (2025-08-15T17:59:21.540Z)

Okay. All right. I was going to say that I need to refer to that more often.

### Guest (2025-08-15T17:59:27.910Z)

Yeah. It lists every calculation. It talks about all the metrics. I've read it. Cover to cover many times. But it's pretty well organized. If you just look in the glossary, it'll tell you where you need to go. I think it's got four main sections. And one of them. One of them is for pnl, one of them for calculations and metrics.

### You (2025-08-15T17:59:50.020Z)

Okay? So let me take a quick look here in the InnVestAI files. And what was the name of it?

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:00:02.310Z)

You, sally. You, Sally. Underscore 11, underscore digital.

### You (2025-08-15T18:00:07.380Z)

Okay? All right. I don't know which folder it would be in, so. Yeah. Could you. Could you take a look through it? And. Double check to make sure it's up. Sample docs. Financial statements. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:00:44.710Z)

Yeah, maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't upload it.

### You (2025-08-15T18:00:49.060Z)

Either that or she can just email me a copy, because I think I pretty much download everything that I get emailed and send it up in there. But it's possible I may have just kept it in my file. But anyway, I don't need to keep you longer on that.

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:01:07.990Z)

I was email it to you right now.

### You (2025-08-15T18:01:08.580Z)

Okay? All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:01:11.830Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-15T18:01:11.860Z)

All right. Have a great weekend.

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:01:14.630Z)

Cool. All right. Thanks a lot. You too.

### You (2025-08-15T18:01:15.860Z)

Yeah, we'll see.

### Guest (2025-08-15T18:01:17.750Z)

Bye.
