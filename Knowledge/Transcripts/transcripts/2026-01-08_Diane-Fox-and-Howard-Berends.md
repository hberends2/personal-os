# Transcript for: Diane Fox and Howard Berends

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:07:57.408Z)

So you had all three.

### You (2026-01-08T16:07:59.412Z)

Yeah. Sorry about that. I was closing out some windows. That's another thing. My laptop is still.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:08:05.088Z)

That's right.

### You (2026-01-08T16:08:07.972Z)

Sucks. I love it, but when I'm on video calls, it freezes and I have to go around and just close everything that I don't need, but anyway. Yeah. My daughter, Even though she's 20 minutes away, she ended up spending the night on Christmas Eve, so it was cool.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:08:28.048Z)

That's fun.

### You (2026-01-08T16:08:29.332Z)

How are yours?

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:08:30.608Z)

It was good. It was good. Yes. Hopefully. Well, hopefully you had some time to decompress. I hope you did that. There was no drama and life was good, and infighting and things like that. That felt good for your central nervous system.

### You (2026-01-08T16:08:55.012Z)

Yeah. No insighting. Just. Again. The usual two things. Last time I spoke, I told you I had two really good job opportunities. And. I'm convinced it's age. Because the phone interviews went. Really well. I knew they were saying, like, yeah, you're perfect for the role. And then all of a video interview and all of a. We get an email. We decided to go with another candidate. Okay, I guess, if they see something. But the thing is, both of them, the hiring manager, they were both the same age. They're like 31. 32. Each one. So after a while of consideration, I am just. I'm no longer going to apply for a decision. And I'm going to fall back more on consulting and advising. And so now I actually have three things in the work for that. We'll see how it goes. I went in and totally revised my profile in LinkedIn, focusing on advising and consulting. And we'll see how that goes.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:10:24.928Z)

Good for you.

### You (2026-01-08T16:10:26.372Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:10:26.608Z)

So are you Howard Beren Consulting still? Or did you choose a different name? Like, what are you doing with your consulting practice?

### You (2026-01-08T16:10:36.052Z)

I don't think it's really necessary to go and set up an actual company. I never have. I've got the domain Berends consulting for email. But I have always done everything under my own name. So in my own name. Social Security number. I don't want to go out and. Ein and everything like that. For the amount of consulting I do, no employees know nothing. It just doesn't make sense. We'll see how it goes. Interestingly enough. I had a really good call yesterday with Archer.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:11:20.528Z)

Oh, good for you.

### You (2026-01-08T16:11:23.572Z)

It was interesting. The CEO made a post on LinkedIn about. His frustration with APIs and trying to get APIs into erd and real page and everything. And I'm reading that, I'm thinking, okay. I. Know from my experience at rediq, the only reason you need an API is if you're looking to. Have a reason for your clients to continuously upload, which is basically the asset management lifecycle management suite that I developed at RunIQ. So I reached out to him. Basically, as soon as I sent the email, maybe an hour later, I got a reply like, yeah, let's talk.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:12:12.928Z)

Good for you.

### You (2026-01-08T16:12:15.172Z)

Basically, yeah, they need to. Create. Like an asset management suite and a marketplace. They want to do marketplace. So it was interesting because I learned that. From a technology standpoint, they have leapfrogged rediq, but from a product they are quite a ways behind. And they've got about, I don't know, maybe a third of the clients Runiq does. Shoestring instead of. I didn't know that. So probably would have a full time opportunity to join as a product leader. But I think we're going to put together some type of. A partnership or consulting, whatever you want to do. Where I can basically go back? And do what I did at one iq, but make it better.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:13:19.168Z)

Good for you. That's awesome. And when they say marketplace, what do they mean by marketplace?

### You (2026-01-08T16:13:25.732Z)

Just like Rediq is owned by Berkadia. They're not owned by Marcus and Militap, but Marcus and Millachap is a strategic investor. And so. The conversation kind of started off. Know. How did it work with Berkadia And how did they share deals with clients? And one of the things I told really well, it worked very easy. It's not difficult to set up, but the clients were frustrated because they could only get Berkadia deals. And that's why we started Marketplace, because they wanted to get deals from any broker, not just Berkeley. And so as we were talking, they realized the value that. They will have to open it up to something other than Marcus and the old champ. And I think. They have to group and figure out how are they going to break the news.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:14:36.208Z)

To marcus and millstein. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:14:37.972Z)

Yeah, we appreciate you being one of our big clients and everything, but now we're going to open up to your competitors. We'll see. But that's an easy thing to work around. Theoretically.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:14:50.608Z)

That's wonderful. That's like a perfect fit for you. And I mean, maybe in time it'll work itself into a full time role, too.

### You (2026-01-08T16:15:01.732Z)

I honestly can say I'm not really interested in a full time role.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:15:06.128Z)

At all anymore or.

### You (2026-01-08T16:15:08.692Z)

I don't know, because I've got that going on. I'm not giving up on invest. That's another thing. I've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks. Redoing the model. And with the former plc, a lot of those pages that we had were just static data. Just to show it got it working now, so we can create a deal, input the data. Go to the valuation page, input all of your assumptions on. There, and that will flow into the investment summary page, calculate your IRRs, cash on cash and everything else. So it's actually getting to be. There's a few things I need to still work on. But it was getting to be a fully functional model. So I'm still in. I don't think.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:16:04.288Z)

That's exciting. I wanted to check in about that.

### You (2026-01-08T16:16:08.772Z)

So.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:16:11.008Z)

I understand either way because it's been a. It was a very tough fourth quarter. And so I understand if you would want to leave. And at the same time, I would love for you to stay, but I respect that you have a lot of things going on, so I wanted to just check, you know, check in with. You personally first and see how you're doing, because I know it was a really rough November and December and then with the job search, but then also take your temperature on if you're still interested in pursuing anything, then best.

### You (2026-01-08T16:16:41.412Z)

Yeah, I think, yes, I am interested. And I think a lot of that depends on you. You had some really good ideas I thought that we talked about last time. He's either strategic partnerships. Or whatever. You put together. Honestly, the only thing I'm undecided about is what would my official role be? What? I just want to be almost like a strategic consultant. Even. In exchange for a lower equity percentage and not be an actual managing partner or non voting partner or voting partner. Or would I. Be a non voting partner. And then how would we structure this? Because. I could work. Multiple opportunities. Even archer. Because I've done all of this in the past. It's not like I'm starting from scratch. So I could do that. Definitely a part time opportunity. InnVestAI same thing. We would need to bring. In a technical leader. But for myself, if I were to go in a strictly product role. And not worry about funding and everything. Step would be there. And I've also got another opportunity, having a second conversation with a gentleman today who's had a few startups. And in multifamily and successful accidents. And he is putting together a fintech. App. Which is an AI powered cash flow tool. Which goes back to my days with Bell Partners and back when I was doing financial analysis, budgeting and forecasting and just kind of taking that and automating it. And again. Since when they're done. That, and he's looking at strictly a product role. But his precede. He's at, like, step one, but he's got the funds.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:19:20.288Z)

Personally. He has the funds. Is that. Yeah, that's good for him.

### You (2026-01-08T16:19:24.292Z)

He's had a few startups. He's got money in the bank. So I'm going to have another conversation. I've only had one 30 minute conversation with him today, but I think we're both aware that it would be a great fit. And I've been thinking about it a lot. I just really think that none of these, at least today, And for the short term. Next maybe six months. I can do all three. Then if one of those three really takes off and becomes more of. A time suck. I can adjust. It. So today I could not come up and say, yeah, I'm going to do this or I'm going to do that.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:20:15.088Z)

When multiple income streams is good. I mean, it's a good thing in this world. It's right. The world is changing, and to rely on one income, just a W2 is very risky, I think, for a lot of people. So your idea to try to create multiple income streams is smart.

### You (2026-01-08T16:20:34.532Z)

Yeah. I think that's what I need to do. And even if I'm thinking. Crap had just turned 64. A couple of weeks ago, I'm like, I do not want. To be in the nine to five. You're not going to handle another five years. Maybe. But. Being a full time employee, I'm looking at these potential equity positions as my future. Income. Right. So, yeah. Do I want 20% of something? And have to be involved with daily decisions, or would I take 5% and just let it ride? I don't know. These are all things that we have to discuss. But anyway, when she catches me up on whatever conversations you've had,

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:21:30.048Z)

Y. Eah, where my head is right now. Is. I have. I had a call before Christmas and I was over December. I had Covid and I was working a lot and I was pretty low from what had happened to like. It took me quite a while to get. The nervous system, like, kind of back, right? I'm starting to now, just this week, feel kind of whole again. But I had a call with a gentleman named Matt Curry. Matt formerly was the head of sales and marketing for my digital office. My digital office was recapitalized and now is called Otellier. And it's a competitor to profit sort. So, you know, Drew has his relationship with profit soared. I met Matt and I met the founder of my digital office, who's now the chairman of Atelier. When I was at cbre. And it was my recommendation to CBRE that they invest $4 million into the company and create a pivot the technology around to create a real estate platform. I did not. I was not able to make that happen. And I felt, honestly, a lot of. I don't know, what's the word you call it, Like, I was embarrassed about that. Right. Because I couldn't make that happen for Ali and Matt. And so we ended all going radio silent. Matt has since left. He now is doing another startup around warranties. But he's very close to Ali, and after the experience last year, I have some personal takeaways, and one is, I mean, someone told this to me just, like, really vet your partners, right? Like, a bad partner is just a terrible place to be. And so I don't want to be in that position where there's another mark in the mix. And so I'm going to be much more careful this time in vetting any potential partners. But Matt and I had a long conversation before the holidays. His current startup. It's like. I may have mentioned this, but it's like a warranty business that they're trying to digitize. But I got the sense that he would love the idea of what we were thinking about within vast. Right. Like it's a big enough idea and why I want to eventually approach Ali about it. And what I'm just thinking about is how I approach Ali about it is because they already are pulling up data. From the operators. They already have 10,000 PNLs. It's very structured, right? And they already have a budget platform that breaks everything down into fixed and variable. I mean. I mean, it's like you almost have the base layer, and you just now need to expand it into an underwriting platform with financial analysis. So he said two things that were very encouraging to me because I did not get to know. I did. I got to know them on the surface, but I didn't get to know them very well. And I was asking just a little bit about Ali. And he said, Diane, Ali is one of the best humans on the face of the planet. He said, we maintain a really close relationship. After my digital office. He's a very, very good person. Now, granted, I have to take this with a grain of salt, right, because I don't even know Matt all that well. But he said, I think Ali would be interested and he would be willing to help. Reconnaissance. So that was in my head, and it still is in my head, because it would just be such a natural progression of what they're doing right now. They already have a CISO in place, right? So they already have security. They already have so many functions in place that it could really take a go to market strategy. Faster if they don't have the same problem that profit soared had when I approached them a year ago about this, which is what they call the technical debt. To their current clients.

### You (2026-01-08T16:25:50.132Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:25:54.368Z)

But we're going to see about that. So what I've been thinking about is how do I best go about this? And so next week, I have a call with a gentleman that was the former chief operating officer of Ashford Hotels. His name is Sloan Dean. He has a new podcast out if you. If you want to. If you're just curious that it's called Not Done by Sloan Dean. He's interviewed probably about 20 different hospitality leaders over the past year. And five of them have technology background. And I understand through Carlos that Sloan wants to do something and the technology space, I think he already has it figured out, but that he's thinking in the technology world, so. I have a call with him next week. My goal with Sloan is three things to see if he'll just spend a tiny bit of time mentoring me on this idea. Spend a tiny bit of time when I get the new pitch deck, dawn looking at it to see if it's compelling or giving me feedback on it. And third, make one strategic introduction for me and maybe others. But the first one is to the new I think it's CEO of Hotel equities, who is a tech guy by background. And he has, you know, built several startups, been very successful, sold them. He I listened to the full podcast where he was interviewed, and if you want to listen to it as well, it's the CEO of Hotel Equities. But he said that Hotel equities has a lab platform for technology initiatives. And so Hotel equities is also a client of Atelier, so you can start to see the interconnection there. Right. Like, if I could get a really good pitch deck done, and I have Sloan give me good feedback on it, and then he makes a strategic introduction to Hotel Equities. Hotel Equities. On the interview that the CEO did at the closing remark, he said, you know, I might still have one more startup left in me, and I just believe in this idea so much that I'd love to pitch it to him. And what I'm just not sure is, do I pitch it to Hotel equities? And then say, just go to Otellier to see about being a strategic partner first. Right. So that they don't think of it as having to take on this whole new initiative. It's more about helping us test, pulling up data. Which they already have. Right. And they already have it in a very structured format. That is the budgeting is very much like underwriting. Or do I go in and pitch something bigger? But my thought on conversations is first, Sloan pitch deck. Then hotel equities to see what they might recommend. They might recommend something totally different. You know, I don't know. I'm just trying to, like, follow the path to a group that I feel like could get you there a lot faster.

### You (2026-01-08T16:29:13.572Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:29:14.528Z)

The second thing is I have all the resources within Driftwood to help me think about how to reboot this. Right. And who could be a technical co founder. I was talking to them this morning, and one of the things that they're working on right now is a valuation model. Right. They're redoing their valuation model. I don't. I think they're doing it in Excel, but they're going to use the same valuation model for asset management and. We were talking about the work I could do on quarterly valuations for them. But you can start to see, when I look at their mission control, it's very impressive. It's all done in Sigma, so it's not software, but they know everybody in the industry, so that's also like in. In my. Like ability to at the right moment to talk to them. But at the same time, I just want to make sure, like, if I go in all alone, I look a lot less credible than I do if we go in together in some capacity, if that makes sense. Right, Because. Right. Because you, you are my, have been my technical partner. And if you want to, you know, still pay a role, but only in product management. That's still vitally important, that we communicate. We actually got to an mvp, right? Like, we had actually built it, and it was, you know, for the most part, successful. We just blew up because of basic co founder, you know, conflict issues, which also I hope. I mean, I hope that story doesn't hurt me. I hope it helps me or us. Because, I mean, really, they were classic co founder mistakes, right? They were too many co founders. Can't make decisions, can't decide if you're going to bootstrap or fundraise.

### You (2026-01-08T16:30:26.852Z)

That makes sense. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:31:19.088Z)

Can't make a decision about how quickly to ship an mvp. Those are the kind of mistakes lots and lots of founders make. Not unique to me, you know. Not unique to you. Not. You need to Drew or to Mark. Sherban is still in the background willing to. Willing to fund up to, like, $60,000. I have 10,000 from the money driftwood, you know, in. In an InnVestAI account to try to deal with the settlement or use for InnVestAI, depending on what happens with Mark and Drew. So those are my initial thoughts, but I think it's really, for me, networking in the hotel tech space. With a really good pitch deck and a story behind it. If you're willing to share that, be part of that storytelling. That look, we really did make it very far. And it was so interesting in the podcast that, well, there were so many podcasts I was listening to of Sloans with his technology leaders. But one of them, Sloan said, do you know the number one reason why startups fail? And I think it was the hotel equity CEO, but it could have been someone else, he said. They run out of money. And he said, yeah, they run out of money. And I was thinking about it, and ours was kind of a derivative of that. We just never raised any money. Right. Like, had we raised some money and could have had you and Benod and myself working full time,

### You (2026-01-08T16:32:57.172Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:33:03.968Z)

We what? We would have still failed because of the five co founders, but it. It was part of it at the end of the day.

### You (2026-01-08T16:33:10.852Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:33:12.208Z)

So I'm not giving up. I just. This is my fourth time at bat. I keep learning, and I believe in it too much to give up. But I really want to be respectful of what you want to do as well, because I. I just like you as a person, Howard, and I have a lot of respect for. You. And so I. I want to make sure that I do the best I can. Do. Does that make. Does that make sense? And, like, respecting your boundaries and what you want to do and all of that?

### You (2026-01-08T16:33:45.892Z)

I. I appreciate that. But yeah. I mean, nothing that I'm doing right now precludes me from being able to join on calls. And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, you know, we can just pick right up and keep going where we left off. I want to make sure that this thing works as well. So when I say taking a limited rolling, I. 'm like, you know. Maybe. You don't like. Run. It. And maybe. I'm an employ. Ee who's not drawing. There's just so many options left. But I'm still. Really want to see this thing take off. So sometimes that I have. From what you just mentioned, number one, speed is. Of the utmost importance. You can see how long. It took the node and the team. To be able. To process the financial statements. Much longer than they thought they could or that they thought it would take. And. They were still probably a little far more away from. Getting. Where we needed to be. Than what we kind of led on at the end. There. So if Otel has the process of. Extracting the data down. That would be a huge win. Because that's my biggest fear. Is that if we had to start over, you know, I've got the model, but I. Don't. Hate it. I don't have the data extraction, and if we had to start over with that, That could take many months again, you know, six, nine months to be able to. Get really working. So how do you structure it? It would be totally up to you. Partnership or strategic partnership if we just outsource and whatever. But if they could do that, and if they're willing to do that, That would be huge. But. Then again, you know, you've got the driftwood relationship, so I'll make sure that there's no conflict there. I don't know if there would be or not.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:36:00.608Z)

There wouldn't be any. I'm. Well, I mean, I have to ask, but I just. Would there. I don't think there would be any conflict. I think, yeah. I mean, I would want to roll the Driftwood investment into it and honor that. Does that make sense? And it's only a small. It's. It's just teeny tiny. Investment, but it's. What's more, over with Driftwood is just everybody that they know and the space, you know, I mean, they might know someone.

### You (2026-01-08T16:36:26.612Z)

Yeah. You mentioned their technical expertise and the products that they're working on right now.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:36:27.248Z)

Yep.

### You (2026-01-08T16:36:31.492Z)

So maybe it could be a three way partnership. I don't know if your relationship, you know, they are working on something.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:36:34.048Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:36:38.132Z)

And. You know, we can just. Bring Hotel Ye in for the data processing and extraction. Bring us in for the valuation and asset management model. And integrate with their systems. I mean, that's always an option. So I'm just getting my opinion. But I just really think from a product management and getting something out that users can start. Working on. We got to get the data extraction part.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:37:03.968Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:37:09.732Z)

So what about mark woodworth?

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:37:13.328Z)

I haven't. Well, I haven't followed up with him because I just didn't know also where we stood. Right. But I can follow up on him. I think what I'm guessing is that he probably got. Well, what do I want to say? There could be a couple of things. He could have gotten a cold reaction from cbre. Like hell. No. We're going to try to do this ourselves, right? Because he's gone up to bat so many times to try to get this. This data, this benchmark or data back. It could be Drew. I mean, Drew could have said, profit soared. Can do this for you. And it profit soared. Sure as hell can do it for them, right? Like, probably out of the box. So could atelier, though, so that. I mean, that could be it. But I think. The gentleman we talked to before Christmas. That was the appraiser lead. Like a follow up. Like, I'm happy to follow up with him and just say, hey, we love the conversation that we had before Christmas. But. But do we really have the ability to help organize their data without Vinod? Like we talked about, you know, when we were talking to John and we were talking about. All the data that they have, that unstructured data that sits across their entire platform and all of that, like without Vinod, are we in a much weaker position to be able to help them with that, or could you bring your friend in that is able. You have a friend, right, that's starting a business about. Taking unstructured data and pulling it up. Like, what are your thoughts on that?

### You (2026-01-08T16:39:02.772Z)

On. Yeah, you know, I would love. For it to be the node. But that's a very common role. In the tech industry and whether we bring on a higher. Contract it out. Partner with somebody, like. Like my friend. I mean, yeah, there's. There's different ways of doing that. My only concern is, are we going after an appraisal market? That. Is number one. A relatively small market compared to the others. And number two, one, that's really actually kind of highly regulated. Where they've got. You know, everything has to be done a certain way, has to be certified before it goes out. And is that something. That. Is going to be worthwhile. I. I think it is. But I would put that near the bottom of the list. You know, I think what we talked about before with, with lenders being the. Probably the easiest to build and then start working on the granular items. Yeah. Because when I heard all the things that the lender needs or the. The appraiser needs, and I did some research on it, And there are a lot of things that we would have to customize specifically for appraisers. So it can be a lot of fun and expense. And when you talk about tech debt, That's really what it boils down to. Don't be afraid of the term. A lot of people talk about tech debt and how horrible it is. It can be. If it's left out of control. But just, you know, as an apply tech debt. Is when you keep. Working on software, and you keep adding features and different things go on, and you get bugs. You know, some bugs you have to fix right away. Some of them are just minor. And so you start adding these things into whatever system you use, like Jira. And then all of a sudden, you find yourself with. A thousand tickets. That. Are dogs that are minor. Client requests all of these things that you. Have in your backlog. But you never get. Around to because you're doing different things. That's tech debt. Because then. Then you have to go back. And when I say thousands of tickets, that's. That's literal. If you take a look at what IQ, for example, they had, you know, 1500, 2000 items. In their backlog. And you get duplicates too. You may have 10 customers that request the same thing, but they're written different or they're recorded. So tech deck means somebody literally has to go through each of those tickets. Do we still need to do this or not? So. It's very much a labor debt if you let it get out of hand again. I've actually worked for a company that basically just said okay. If it's more than you, delete it.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:42:44.528Z)

The ticket. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:42:46.772Z)

It's like, okay, we haven't really done this in a year. Why are we still looking at it? I mean, that's kind of a radical way of doing it. Because who knows? You know, you may have had. A. A ticket that really does provide some benefit. But they'll still think about it. So when I think about the appraiser part, If we even start to think about it right now and we start gathering ideas and putting it in our backlog, that's tech debt. As we keep working on the lender. And the investor and the broker. Items first, that will actually probably generate much more revenue. Meantime, all these other things for appraisers are backing up. And then some years from now, and we go back and like, okay, we've got all these things. What do we need to do?

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:43:39.488Z)

You're right. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:43:40.372Z)

Yeah, to me.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:43:42.448Z)

It's not the highest and best use of like, we bet we'd be better off.

### You (2026-01-08T16:43:46.452Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:43:47.008Z)

And I do. I mean, I really want to. I mean, I think Sloan. I know Sloan. It's not like he's a stranger to me. He and I work together 15 years ago on a project, so I think. And he's a very people oriented person, so I think he'll give me a little. Bit of time. I just have to use that time very, very well and try to get the most strategic introductions I can. The CEO of Hotel equities is based in Honolulu, but their chief development officer and their chairman are based here in Alpharetta with me, my same little city that I'm in. So I mean, I'm hopeful about that. And I'm hopeful about the relationship with driftwood as well, because they're very advanced, and I think they would want to be part of something like, you know, like be one of the core consumers, where I kind of think of this as like, driftwood and hotel equities come together and they're the two clients that you're actually testing everything on, right?

### You (2026-01-08T16:44:51.092Z)

Y.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:44:51.648Z)

But then you. Maybe you. We approach atelier as a smaller ask initially.

### You (2026-01-08T16:44:51.652Z)

Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:44:58.528Z)

Hoping that that small ask becomes. They like it so much, they want to, like, be a bigger part of it, but that we don't go in with such a big ask that it's a no initially. Does that make sense?

### You (2026-01-08T16:45:11.012Z)

Yeah. So as you're describing Otelier. In my mind, I went to Total Fund. I think of them as a direct replacement of Drew.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:45:23.408Z)

Yes.

### You (2026-01-08T16:45:24.292Z)

I think we had originally talked to Drew. About?

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:45:27.648Z)

Data processing. That's what I thought Drew was going to do.

### You (2026-01-08T16:45:29.172Z)

The links in the data processing, but after we had already started, we might even know. That's not what I do. I do this. And it just didn't fit.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:45:30.368Z)

Yes.

### You (2026-01-08T16:45:37.812Z)

Okay? I just want to make sure.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:45:39.248Z)

Exactly. Exactly.

### You (2026-01-08T16:45:39.572Z)

That I have a clear understanding.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:45:41.648Z)

With more infrastructure built around it. Right. Because they also have the budgeting platform and they have the security developed. Right. And so. And they have 100 team technical team in Sri Lanka. I remember that from when I was at cbre. And they have a former sales and marketing leader who would probably love to come back and do something like this. And the difference. Which is? You told me this all of last year. He sells fast. Right. That's what he does. So he is a proven SaaS sales leader in the industry. Not. He doesn't know real estate. And I think that was another problem. As Mark and I, our skills were too overlapping, and there wasn't enough differentiation between what we each brought to the table. But I feel like getting Matt excited about this because it could be Matt is the one out there. I mean, they have someone else selling on the operator side. Right. But if we were to take this on, this could be a really great role for Matt. And my uncle is still in the background to helping on the go to market stuff. So I have to think about that piece of it, but.

### You (2026-01-08T16:47:00.772Z)

Go.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:47:06.368Z)

And I'll just end with this is. There's. It's still. There's no solution in hospitality for this. Right. And so all the other property types are finding solutions and we are sitting here with nothing. Do you think Mark and Drew will try to form a competitor based on what you know about? Them the situation.

### You (2026-01-08T16:47:33.892Z)

I have no idea. I. Can see you. Might. Think he know? S how we'll do it. I want to see how he want to be distracted from his current business. To start over again. If they think that if they still think that they can get the source code. And just pick up a left off, they're going to have a rule awakening. It's not going to be that easy. So I don't know if she'll be any indication. I assume that if he had drug watch, the returning would have been notified, so I doubt that there's any progress on that.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:48:21.408Z)

He hasn't heard anything. No.

### You (2026-01-08T16:48:27.652Z)

I don't want to sound arrogant, but I'm not concerned. About whether they can or cannot do it. We'll watch five or eleven. We're more expertise in it. Everything is. I remember Drew mentioning many times that. He's never done the acquisitions. He's open airfield management. He did have some pretty good input into the model. But it was not really from an accurate section standpoint. It was from the matrix and formulas. Of course they could try. Mark. Participating. He could not do anything without true have to do two of them combined. And again, I just don't think that they've got any expertise. I don't think they would ever get out there. Gripping with us.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:49:37.568Z)

Okay? And, you know, Sherman keeps telling me over and over again I might have to disband, InnVestAI. And I. I push back just because the bank account is set up. And, like, that was not a super easy thing to do, you know, with getting it all set up with driftwood and everything, but I'm prepared. If I have to do that. I just want to push it off as long as I can until I'm in a really good rhythm with driftwood.

### You (2026-01-08T16:49:53.412Z)

Yeah, yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:50:07.968Z)

And secondly, I did lock down the domain name in exchange, which I kind of like it because I do want to become a marketplace. I just like Archer is thinking about there's wide open space for that and hospitality and the. You got a sense of what the data's like. No commercial platform could really do it for hospitality. Well, so, you know, including that as part of the pitch deck is important to me because I think it's the. It's like the end game, when it's all said and done and the way to monetize in the best way possible.

### You (2026-01-08T16:50:42.612Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:50:48.448Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:50:51.332Z)

But. If that's all it takes to pay for it, then it's probably. At least an evil that they could do after 10 seconds, I guess. I don't know.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:51:03.408Z)

The paperwork of having to spend and restart another entity and stuff like that.

### You (2026-01-08T16:51:05.892Z)

Yeah. Just decided not one. But the big thing was, you know if in verse 8 is done they can't you so, you know.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:51:19.328Z)

Yeah. Yeah, we will see. So thank you for your patience in dealing with all the drama, with the cease and desist and everything like that. I'm hoping after the new year, maybe tempers have calmed down and reality is starting to set in. Because, I mean, not that Sherman's time is really, truly free. It's not, right? It comes with a high cost with his involvement. But. But a couple of things. He definitely is a lot more. Structural than I am. Right. Like, I fly high. And so having a partner that has all that structure in his mind is a good balance to me. And then second, Drew's paying out of pocket for his attorney. So if they even want to answer that letter that Sherman sent about what does Drew technically own from an IP perspective, I mean, that's going to cost them a couple grand to have their attorney probably respond to that. Right. And so Drew's going to have to make a decision if he wants to keep incurring costs here.

### You (2026-01-08T16:52:22.852Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:52:31.248Z)

If Mark offers to pay for the cost, is Mark actually going to do that? Because Mark has never really. Shown up, you know, in a meaningful way. And so can Drew. Trust that Mark will stick around, pay for the cost. So I'm just hopeful that at some point I'll say, let's just get this thing settled and. If they want the source code. We're cooperating, right? We've cooperated with everything.

### You (2026-01-08T16:52:58.932Z)

Y. Eah. All right, well, things good. So going forward.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:53:02.688Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:53:08.452Z)

Not that much. I use Apple Calendar but connected to my Gmail account. And InnVestAI. But if somebody makes up for you listening. I have to put it on both calendars to show InnVestAI. So if when you can make sure to keep that category link. You're welcome. Wow. Show everything. Because I'm like, it's not a rock calendar on that will show my free busy.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:53:45.888Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:53:46.932Z)

If it's too complicated. Or whatever.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:53:54.848Z)

And it's best to reach you at Howard Beren, the Gmail account.

### You (2026-01-08T16:53:55.012Z)

So anyway. Just touching now. Yeah, so we'll all go to the same place eventually.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:54:00.688Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:54:06.852Z)

I got. A half a. Mile in every. Domain and everything I've done. Luck six or seven different emails. We all ended up.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:54:15.648Z)

And we can keep the team's account up and running because I know we don't use it a ton, but it does help a little bit.

### You (2026-01-08T16:54:22.292Z)

We can keep it up and running, but if we have to go out the nfai, that means. Basically, we're going to have to figure out how we can transition over to a new account. If I am starting again. I would have workspace. I'm not a movie fan. What I like about the Microsoft.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:54:50.928Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:54:53.092Z)

Microsoft likes to lock you into only Microsoft products. There are so many things that you can do. Even sharing documents is rolling easier in Google. And what I really like is in every Google document, if you and I will run it at the same time. You see my name and we're looking for my cursor is I see learning and increasing. Two people working on it at the same time. Whereas in Microsoft, You got to make a comment. You can't really do that.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:55:33.088Z)

I'm totally open to that.

### You (2026-01-08T16:55:34.132Z)

So.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:55:34.368Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:55:36.132Z)

It's just way easier, and I think it's going to be cheaper. So we can still use Microsoft products.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:55:41.888Z)

Got it.

### You (2026-01-08T16:55:48.052Z)

That's my thing. I think if we had to give up the domain, Which would also involve changing all of the Microsoft over the list they're looking for and look into it. And same thing. I like Outlook. I think it can do an email thing because you got the calendar, the email, all everything was very easily accessible. With Google. They are technically separate apps. So it's like, where do you do that? On one. Calendar on another. But that. 's probably my biggest complaint. I want that.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:56:29.248Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:56:29.332Z)

But like I said, I'm sure invested in the athlete environment. And Apple actually does a very good job of going out to these various places and bringing them into. So I can just use that Apple calendar. And. It goes both ways easily.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:56:46.688Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T16:56:47.492Z)

Anyway.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:56:47.808Z)

I'm keeping my Invest email for right now just because my Gmail gets so out of hand with, like, retail, like, emails from, like, I can't.

### You (2026-01-08T16:56:58.692Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:56:58.768Z)

I can't stop them. They seem to just multiply and then I can't find the important emails. But my next thing is a quick wall. Very quick call with Sloan. I think it's going to be next week, but he's having a new baby and so that it might get pushed. But then I'm going to be working on the pitch deck, so I'll send the pitch deck when I have it.

### You (2026-01-08T16:57:16.932Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:57:22.608Z)

I have to fit that into my driftwood work, so it'll. And I'm paring down to two days a week at my retail job because five days a week was killing me. So I'm going to be available every Monday through Thursday, straight up. And I'm only working weekends at my retail. Job now and then. I would, though. I mean, if I end up having two conversations with Sloan, I'd love to bring you into the second one. And if I can get that introduction to the Hotel Equity CEO, I'd like you on the first call because he's a tech person. Right. And so I don't. Want to go in as a non tech person without a tech person.

### You (2026-01-08T16:57:48.932Z)

Y. Es. Right.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:58:01.488Z)

With me. And then any other calls with anyone from hotelier, I'd like to have you on if you're open to it. Just so that. But. But, yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T16:58:11.892Z)

Absolutely. Yeah. I would love to see more. Imagine. Hope that you can just keep that camera in any of my other readings.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:58:19.248Z)

Y.

### You (2026-01-08T16:58:24.372Z)

On my Google calendar, so that way, if I do have something scheduled, don't overlap. So. Yeah, like I said, I'm still 100% in. So any readings you want me to join?

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:58:37.968Z)

Eah. Great. And I do think multiple income streams is smart, like, for anybody at this point. Like, like, I would advise my daughter coming out of school for the rest of her life. Like, think about your life as having to have multiple income streams because there are few companies that are feel safe right now. It just, it's a weird weird time. What do you think? What do you think we tell people, like, what's the shortest, sweetest move on response as to why we failed? The first time around, and we're in 2.0 mode.

### You (2026-01-08T16:59:17.012Z)

You. I think. I think you hit the meal on the editor earlier. We just had too many founders. We could not. Agree. We were being pulled in multiple directions, and it just was. N't. To keep up that way. We just had. To basically celebrate.

### Guest (2026-01-08T16:59:37.328Z)

Okay? And speaking of the two, because it was Jessica who flat out said we had too many co founders, right? That was pretty sobering when she said that. But she's on our radar screen as well because she may be able to help find a technical co founder. If my first idea of this, you know, follow the dots and get to Ali, doesn't work, but I have hope because this is a great idea, and I mean, They would be silly to pass on something like this when it's so adjacent to their core business. So I have hope.

### You (2026-01-08T17:00:18.132Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T17:00:19.888Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T17:00:20.852Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-08T17:00:22.128Z)

Very good. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye.
