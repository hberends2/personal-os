# Transcript for: Book a Meeting with Jean (Howard Berends)

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:30:36.258Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-12-22T17:30:37.780Z)

Hey, good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:30:39.538Z)

Good morning. Doing very good. And you?

### You (2025-12-22T17:30:42.100Z)

I'm doing very well, thank you. Good to meet you.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:30:45.378Z)

Thanks the same. Thanks for taking time to discuss how the project I'm working on now.

### You (2025-12-22T17:30:55.540Z)

Yeah. Interesting to learn more about it.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:31:00.738Z)

Yeah. To kind of set the stage of what we are. So we are three co founder now. We've been working on this project. Well, myself, I've been working on this project. Several months now. I left my previous company recently, so I sold the company almost a year ago, and I've been working on the transition, but left three months ago. To refocus really on this project. I've been the project space for five years now. But fintech, between fintech and product, where you have for the last almost all my, not all my career.

### You (2025-12-22T17:31:48.340Z)

Go.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:31:52.018Z)

I was remote focused on the payment space before. Rent payment. And of course, I've been talking to all my customers about their. Mostly about payment, but trying to figure out how they manage their cash flow. And merchant impact of digital payment. And that's what we are looking to build now. It's a platform. For me to large size property manager. So it's a financial platform. That essentially focus on cash flow and risk management. I found that it's kind of a wide space now. There is no real platform, financial platform, that really covers everything about cash management and risk management and payments, all under one roof and also including potentially banking services.

### You (2025-12-22T17:33:01.300Z)

Go.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:33:03.378Z)

So we have some, we'd call it now, some secret sauce on how we envision to design the platform. AI is, of course, like every platform, but for now, in the future, playing a big part of the solution. But that's the kind of the 10,000ft of what we are looking at building.

### You (2025-12-22T17:33:32.820Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:33:35.218Z)

The rest of the team, essentially engineers of people that I know for a long time that are very strong experience in building financial platform.

### You (2025-12-22T17:33:47.780Z)

Can I ask you one quick question?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:33:49.298Z)

Yeah, sure.

### You (2025-12-22T17:33:50.180Z)

You mentioned managing cash flow. Did you say waste management as in trash refuse, or did I misunderstand?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:00.978Z)

No. I'm not. Sure. I'm not sure to understand your question, in fact.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:08.420Z)

Yeah. You mentioned that you had talked to customers and asked how they manage their cash flow. And I think you said after that and waste management or digital. I just want.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:20.498Z)

No, sorry, my bad. Risk management.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:23.300Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:24.498Z)

To manage your.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:25.860Z)

I'm sorry you broke up.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:28.738Z)

Yeah. I say that risk management.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:32.020Z)

Okay? So they're refuse, trash pickup. Is that what I'm understanding? Waste?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:43.058Z)

No.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:44.820Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:45.058Z)

By risk, I mean everything associated with the risk of.

### You (2025-12-22T17:34:49.300Z)

Okay, I'm sorry. Misunderstood. I thought it was way. Okay, risk. That makes sense. There's quite a few people in the waste management space right now I didn't quite understand. Okay, thank you for clarifying.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:34:55.218Z)

Yellow. No, typically. Every kind of risk that can impact the cash flow socially in the future. Like resident paying on time or delinquency or not paying on time and delegates this kind of thing. Before, my experience was essentially in treasury management for copyright and treasury management and risk management for investment banks. So it's kind of bringing all this experience that we had developed for corporate and banks into the real estate space.

### You (2025-12-22T17:35:42.500Z)

Okay? So with Red. Rula, I know that you were focused on resident. Payments. So are you now? Just taking it up to the next level for the management, companies, owners. Asset management. Is that kind of what you're looking at for it in terms of risk management or cash flow?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:36:05.618Z)

Yeah. So indeed, now to some extent, B2B to C. Because of course, we are dealing with resident and we need to understand the resident behaviors and how it might impact or affect the cash flow for the property manager. But yeah, the primary customer is and the value proposition is for the property manager.

### You (2025-12-22T17:36:28.980Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:36:29.378Z)

It's with Financial Platform Property manager. We are. Not, we will not directly interact with the risk, at least for now.

### You (2025-12-22T17:36:40.980Z)

Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay? So what Pain Point, then are you trying to solve? What is the job to be done that you're looking to do with this product?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:36:55.778Z)

There are quite a lot of pain points here. The first one is having daily cash visibility. Knowing how much cash they have available across all their bank account and property manager. As you know, they are dealing with lot of bank accounts.

### You (2025-12-22T17:37:12.020Z)

Go.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:37:12.258Z)

So that's why our target is essentially mid. Well, initially it's going to be mid size property manager, between 1000 to $5000. And giving them visibility. And along with the bank reconciliation. That's number one. Number two, and that's what they do for large part using their existing pms. But they provide very static report about cash. It become more difficult when they have several PMFs. You have some operators they are dealing with on one side of their portfolio. It's managed with Yadid, the other with RealPage. So it's solving the prime of. Performance in term of having visibility, real time visibility. And replacing Excel for a large part or manual processes that is very time consuming.

### You (2025-12-22T17:38:19.780Z)

Go.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:38:21.138Z)

Number two is giving them visibility in the future. They don't have. Now they are trying to do some forecasting, but since it's very manual, it's not very accurate, very time consuming and again, all done in Excel. And that doesn't re advertise very well. All the risk management side. And the last piece is how to optimize their cash flow, their working capital. So once you know how much cash you're going to have available in a week or even now, but you can start thinking about how to optimize your cash flow.

### You (2025-12-22T17:39:09.780Z)

That sounds exciting, because as you're going through this, I've already touched on a lot of these. In my experience. I do have a degree in finance, so I've always. Been on the numbers side of the business. Back around. 2010. It's been about 15 years, but when I was with Bell Partners, I wrote a white paper called Managing from the Back of the Boat. And it was really kind of about. How those financial management systems are looking historically. You got all this information. There's historical information, all you can do. But there wasn't really any forward looking other than your annual budget process. When I was with bell partners, I also developed. A 90 day forecasting. Instead of looking forward, it was just basically a rolling forecast. Especially in those scenarios, in multifamily, they start the budgeting process in June. Who's going to have a crystal ball clear enough that they can see 18 months out to know what they're going to be doing in December of the following year. I thought that was pretty ridiculous. So I have a lot of experience building these models, taking your historical, and you can make your adjustments, et cetera. And also one of the things that I've done. Is create a web app for personal finance. That does exactly that. There's all sorts of personal finance apps out there that will connect to your bank telling you what's been closed, but nothing that includes the forward looking budgeting. So this is something I've always been pretty passionate about. Obviously, I knew nothing about what you were doing before the call, but now I'm thinking this is actually a good fit for what I've done in the past, and I'd love to hear more about it.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:41:23.058Z)

Yeah, I found that there is not real competition. So yeah, to type A competition, potentially existing pms, but. Accounting system. So they look at the past. And they are not great at looking in the future. The other thing that we've been looking at is how can we develop a financial platform that's not going to compete with the Yali of the world? But where we can partner. So not taking some part on where there is no or little overlap with what they are doing. And where they will be more keen to do a partnership democratic aggression, because we need to work with all this platform. The source of the data is going to come from. There. And the other potential competition are all the treasury management system that exists now, but they are all designed for B2B. They are not specific for real estate, so they don't understand resident they don't understand a property, so they can in some ways try to model that, but they are not really designed from the get go to understand. Resident risk and model the specificities of the business of a property manager.

### You (2025-12-22T17:42:48.980Z)

But. Taking account the delinquencies, looking at your upcoming lease expirations. A couple things just also popped into mind. I worked with a company called Retics, and that was ten years ago. Who was doing something similar on the property operation side, not the financial, but taking data from any partner management system, Guardi real page, mri, et cetera. Bringing the data in and normalizing it. So it didn't matter which property management system was the source. We could do that. And we did something very similar at rediq as well. With rediq, we were able to upload financial statements, we were able to upload rent rolls, extract the data. Using machine learning as well as some rules based extraction. Be able to normalize that and also then map that data. From the source documents into. A. We call it master chart of accounts. Right. Again, we could do the same thing. So yeah, I see an option there for not only helping the individual owners, but then you've got a lot of forward looking data that. You could anonymize aggregate. That would be a gold line, obviously. And the other thing that I thought about is, When I was working. With some of the larger institutional clients, both in my days in the property operations and asset management, but also in the prop tech side of things. Is you've got. A lot of institutional investors who own a very large portfolio, but they're managed by different management companies, and those management companies choose their own right. So if you've got the ability to take this data from the various real page gallery, et cetera. Aggregate it, normalize it. So that these investors. Can take a look at their entire portfolio. That was something that we started to work on at RedIQ is simply because all these companies are copy cutting and pasting, taking Excel files. And having analysts take hours to take all this data. To put it together. So that they could see a portfolio view of know. That's something also that could just be automated. And be very simple. And. That is where you can get a lot of API integration. So you can go directly to the source, not have to upload a file. And extract the data. AI Machine learning. They do a good job. But. If there's one minor change, it'll kick it out of the system. Right. Especially if there's OCR involved in the process. This is actually very exciting.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:46:26.818Z)

We are looking aside. We are ready to start now. The question that I have is whether to. What's the right time to bring someone else into the team? One second. To bring someone else into the team. As I mentioned to other co founders, engineers, I cover the product side, but then I'm thinking about bringing someone else to be kind of my wing partner here. We can really be very hands on in defining the user stories and working with the team, but also bringing some new insight of expertise or prospective into the mix. So ideally, someone who has a background in prop tech or real estate, we understand the business side, but also who has a financial background. Where are you now? In your journey. Thank you. You work? More like as a consultant. But you left your job a year ago, or last January or so.

### You (2025-12-22T17:48:04.820Z)

Yeah, yeah. Rediq was previously owned by Berkadia And sold to radix. It looked like the. Perfect partnership. Simply because. Rediq was contraction prohibited from using a lot of Berkadia data that they get from third parties like Co Star, et cetera. So we were very limited in only being able to use the data that we collect from the users. And I actually. Was one of the biggest projects I did starting. Or when I started with RedIQ is they were strictly a valuation model. Used by investors. And brokers to come up with evaluation. They would use it for a short period of time, and then they would either buy the property or somebody else would buy it. And that's where the user journey ended. Well. On that data that they use for valuation. Can continue to provide value all the way until the point where they sell the property. So I was creating what we call the Lifecycle management suite. So everything from the point if they are the winning bid, they acquire the property. We would convert it over to more of an asset management tool. Where they could upload the finance statement on a monthly or quarterly basis. And we were also using that data then to provide underwriting guided binds. Forward looking data, what are they projecting for their cap rates when they sell in five years, things like that. But since we couldn't access that other data from Berkadia some to Radix, who had that data was a dream come true. But the problem was Radix was up to their eyeballs in the real page class action lawsuit.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:50:04.338Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-22T17:50:05.060Z)

They had to do a complete pivot on their core project. The product. Excuse me. And essentially. They didn't shut down Rediq, but they took it down. To only the personnel they needed to keep the lights on. And so some of the people were on the engineering team. Were moved over into the Radiq's side to work on their core product. Everybody else was let go. So there was a large number of us who were let go at the end of January. They kept one junior engineer, one customer service rep out of a team of five Sale. I mean, everybody was just like, so since then, I've been looking for opportunities. Whether it be fractional consulting or full time employee. But I've been very particular because my background. The only movie industry I worked in really is commercial real estate, and specifically multifamily. So 30 plus years. I wasn't about to go and try to be a product manager for a company who created a customer app for Kohl's for department stores. No way I would be able to go in there. So I have been doing some consulting. And that will end in about a week and a half, the end of the months. So I have been looking for other opportunities. Like I said, it could be fractional, could be full time, but it has to be specifically. In the commercial real estate multifamily. The project that I'm working on right now is a valuation model. For a different asset class for hospitality. No. Conflict of interest there. But recently, about six weeks ago, It basically imploded. I hate to say it, but we had two co founders who could not work with each other. So work essentially came to a total halt back right after Thanksgiving, and I don't see any possibility that they're going to be able to reconcile. So I just told them I'll help out through the end of the year. And even then, it's really only about 5 to 10 hours a week is all I've got to put in right now. I'm available to start. With the right opportunity anytime and can be very creative in how we structured.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:53:00.178Z)

Yeah. The objective is sorry for us. When you start a new adventure. At least for me. Now it's the balance between raising capital now precede round. Of waiting for a seed round where we have mvp. And considering AI development now things are going much faster. So I'm more thinking about trying to build the MVP and then going for funding.

### You (2025-12-22T17:53:41.380Z)

What we were doing with the other opportunity as well, in the hospitality. Actually, this last year has been extremely interesting for me. Because. I've been. I dove off the deep end on the AI Coding in particular, so I've been spending hours and hours in Claude code. Made a large number of apps using cloud code. Some of them just POCs, like this company I've been working with. Told know I'll save you somebody. And I built them their CRM. I built them a robot tool kind of competitive with Confluence or Jira, as well as the full PoC for their underwriting product. So, yeah, Bill. Using some of these tools, putting together a poc. What used to take months can now be done in a week.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:54:43.698Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-22T17:54:45.140Z)

It's amazing.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:54:46.818Z)

So you are familiar with vibe coding. Now the very ends on we say it's been evolving so fast and then very interesting the way I was thinking about AI year ago versus 6 months and now it has even the way I see AI and how to use AI leverage AI is. Very interesting how it's changing. That's the person I'm looking as well. I want someone because AI, we want to use AI. Of course, for AI development, so all the prototyping and being able to develop or test faster, but the whole application is based on the AI as well.

### You (2025-12-22T17:55:33.620Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm well beyond the simple build your own task management app. Most of the tool. In fact, all of the tools that I've been building lately, the CRM, the JIRA product, the poc, all have a very complicated backend. Full authentication. And embedded AI as well. The hospitality one in particular. I was working with agents that you know if I'm underwriting an asset or a hotel. And multifamily. It's all the same. You need that historical data, but you also need market data, which includes. I had an agent that would go out and get the tax records I'd have, and then the one that would go out and get the current insurance. So now the one that would go out. And get demographics. So going out and getting all this different information, bringing it in, consolidating it, and, you know, within minutes, Have an extremely detailed report. That they could handle to a lender, hand over to an investment committee, et cetera. So, yeah, even getting to that point, I'm very comfortable in working with agendic AI and different things that we can do there, which, again, I can see plenty of opportunity for very similar functionality here.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:57:02.018Z)

Okay? Where are you based, by the way?

### You (2025-12-22T17:57:09.700Z)

I'm in michigan.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:57:11.298Z)

Missing. For now. I think, just out of curiosity, we will. At least specific time zone. Let's read the thinking now for me. Meeting with some people and see if that makes sense to bring a new product person right now, if there is a good feed, good complementarity and then if it can help us to pre go a bit faster. By bringing these different. Experience or expertise into the mix.

### You (2025-12-22T17:58:02.500Z)

Yeah, I mean, I can certainly get you up and running with the POC very quickly. You know, I use AI Extensively for putting together the documentation. We don't need 20 pages of a PRD to get started. Essentially, now we're moving to the point where the POC is the prd. You're putting together. And then once you get the win, you like it. Use that for the basis of your documentation. In case you'll get hit by that train and somebody else needs to pick up and run with it. You know, you just have to be prepared. This sounds like a great opportunity. So. I'll imagine you need some time to get.

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:58:48.738Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-22T17:58:48.740Z)

That make?

### Guest (2025-12-22T17:58:52.178Z)

I want to make a decision within the next. Two, three weeks. We are ready to start now. Object tv is to get all together around mid chan. While to just get to know each other. So I know very well my tools are co founders and then but making sure that the team know each other and then having a complete brainstorming on how we going to shape the MVP and then align the align on the on the objective so you would be comfortable in a model that. We all invest time. I don't know. Pre three months to be the MVP and then raising fund after that.

### You (2025-12-22T17:59:53.940Z)

That was the. That was the plan with the other company I've been working with. My wife was in a similar situation where she was working with the co founder and it didn't work out either. But, yeah, we're both very familiar with the process and, you know, investing a little sweat equity or whatever, if that's what. What it takes. Yeah, that's. That's always an option.

### Guest (2025-12-22T18:00:22.658Z)

Okay? Good. Well, now that you have at least some ideas about the vision, Think about that. Maybe we can reconvene just after Christmas to have a second round and do a deeper dive. Maybe.

### You (2025-12-22T18:00:53.780Z)

I will take a look at the notes that I put together, and I can come up with, you know, a list of ideas. You know again. So many years on the asset management and ownership and operations side of the multifamily, combined with, you know, the last 15 years in the prop tech side, I think I would be able to. Blend those two together very well, and I'll take a look at some of the things that I've done in the past. I think that would be very applicable to this. And, you know, I can come up with some bullet points and we can go from there.

### Guest (2025-12-22T18:01:25.938Z)

Okay? Cool.

### You (2025-12-22T18:01:27.700Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-12-22T18:01:28.018Z)

Well, Second World was great to meet you today. Have a happy holidays and, yeah, let's reconvene next week.

### You (2025-12-22T18:01:37.300Z)

Sounds good. You have a great holiday as well. Look forward to talking to you again.

### Guest (2025-12-22T18:01:41.218Z)

Thanks.

### You (2025-12-22T18:01:41.700Z)

Okay? All right. Thank you.
