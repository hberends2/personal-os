# Transcript for: Settlement

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:03:17.488Z)

So I guess let me tell you about the call, and then I'll give you my thoughts on settlement and then we can fold in the node thing. So I guess I called them up. And I, you know, said, hey, it's my introduce myself sending, you know, calling regarding your cease and desist. At first, you didn't you know what I was talking about? He's like, who? What? What matters this? And I'm like, your clients Mark and Drew. So cease and desist. And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah. And he's like, and why are you calling? I'm like, because at the end of your letter, you said, call you if you want to talk about a resolution. So I'm assuming, you know. And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I said, so have you had a chance to talk to your clients and find out what you know. And, you know, he's like, yeah, they don't want any money. You know, they want. I. You know, basically, he's like, they want the co. You know, he's like, you know. They. He said, drew owns the code or, you know. And I said, well, you know, I'm not so sure about that. There's a capital contribution to the. You know. Well, first he was like, I think we agree that, you know, this shouldn't go into litigation where no one's going to win except the lawyers, blah, blah, blah, you know, And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. And I'm thinking, okay, this is going well. And then he's like, they don't. Really want. They don't want any money. And I'm like, okay, this is going to be. This is going well so far, too. And then he was like, you know, they want the code. Or, you know, Drew. Will. Drew owns the code or something like that. And I said, well, you know, I think that's a capital contribution. You know, it was developed for the company, whatever. And he's like. Then he just started, like. Going like, Mr. Defensive tough guy. He's like, oh, there was no agreement, and all the invoices were in True's name. And so this is. And then there's the, you know, fraud and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, well, you don't. And I. This guy is not. A litigator. He's a corporate guy. Looked him up, his bio up. He's a. He's a corporate, you know, m and a guy. He sort of. He's not a litigator. And I said, well, I said, well, I'm a litigator. And. And he, and he's like, well, congratulations. And I was just like, as you know, fraud has a heightened pleading standard, which you can't, you know, you can't meet in this case. You don't have the entire. We have emails that shows that. She. I'm like, that's not. That's not, you know, fraudulent, blah, blah, blah. And. So he's just going off and off about this fraud. And I finally. And he almost hung up on me, and he got quiet, and I thought he did. I haven't been talking for a little bit, and I'm like, did he? Am I talking to a dead phone? But I'm waiting for my. Phone to go peep, and it didn't. But I was just like, you know, you keep, you know, bring. You. You threaten this fraud stuff and all this, and I'm like, you're gonna open yourself to a defamation case. And on this and that, and he was just. And. And then he basically just ended. The call, and I was just like, all right, so then, you know, he sends you the email, like, he's mean to me and blah, blah, blah, and yelling at me and all this, which is. Was odd, but. But the. It seems like they want the cop. So. And it seems like I would imagine if we present both those options to them, they're going to pick option one. No money. Give us the code. Basically. I'm of the agreement as well that, Howard, that when if you're going to code it again, it's going to be better, it's going to be more efficient, you've learned, you know stuff on how to design this. So I don't think, you know, it should take as long to redevelop. Now this. I didn't know about the whole Linode scenario. Like, I. Howard, maybe you can talk more about the Vinod relationship. I thought you guys were closer. It was like you two are the team, but if it looks. Like he's going to throw his lot in with Mark and Drew because he thinks that gets him out of any immigration snafu. Because you can set the nodes mind at ease that if this thing settles. They're releasing all claims against all parties, you know, everything. So it's done. Like, there's no chance that he's going to get hauled into court or anything for SL llc? And. But I'm wondering if, behind the scenes, they want the code because they're working on a node to plm away from you two. So they say once we have the code of a node, then we can keep going on our merry way with this. That is what I am afraid of. If that's the case then Vinod's not really trustworthy guy anyways. Like you only want people who are in on your side. You don't want someone who's working both sides. Or. Or if he's. Even if he's thinking he's going to be sneaky that. Way, then. No, no, stiqi is the right word, but maybe he. I mean, not sneaky. You know what I mean? Like, I think he's a good. Go ahead.

### You (2025-12-15T15:08:30.452Z)

All right. So I was going to say. Let me jump in, please, if you could. I know Diane has a valid concern. I even mentioned that. Yeah, I mean, that's always a possibility. But I spoke to Vinod after Diane and I spoke, and I asked him straight up. I said, have you been in contact with Drew or anybody else? And he. I believe, sincere. I've worked with him long enough, and he says, I don't want to have anything to do with this. I am just done with it and I'm moving on. So, I mean, yeah, there's always a possibility. Right. But I don't believe the Node A would do that. And be. I do think he's sincere. But.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:09:20.688Z)

Why do you think he hasn't asked for the software engineers to be paid or any of his out of pockets?

### You (2025-12-15T15:09:21.172Z)

Yeah. They already were. They already were.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:09:28.608Z)

For december.

### You (2025-12-15T15:09:29.892Z)

Paid for November. They're not doing anything in December.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:09:33.328Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-15T15:09:34.932Z)

After the meeting when everything blew up. That was like, what, the 25th or something like that?

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:09:40.688Z)

Fif. Th.

### You (2025-12-15T15:09:41.252Z)

Yeah, I believe that at that point. They didn't really do anything. I've had a standing Friday call, which, of course was canceled the day after Thanksgiving. But even before this letter came about when Vanilla didn't everybody, we were still active. They canceled the call, so I don't believe that they've done anything. In December, two we paid for. But I can't say for certain.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:10:14.368Z)

Okay? Okay, so you don't have the same fear that I have because I. It just.

### You (2025-12-15T15:10:21.172Z)

Not to the same degree you do. In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, that would suck if he did that, but.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:10:23.088Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-15T15:10:29.252Z)

I'm going to stay in touch with him. And I don't have a problem telling him what Mike just said. If once this thing is settled, he has no fear. And, yeah, I mean, between us, I've been making a lot of progress over the last week on the newer, better version. Of this. And quite frankly, if they were to get the code and move forward, I hope they do. Let them. Let them go forward with that, because we will be out with something better before they can do anything.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:11:01.008Z)

Well. That's a good point. Can I ask, and this is, this is just from a lifelong my career, right. Working with big companies like Marriott and Hilton, where the specific problem has come up, a lot of owners complain about Marriott for years and years and years that they didn't share enough information with owners. Marriott eventually just got sick of it and said, okay, we're going to share the information. And they shared it in such a messy, disorganized, overwhelming way. There was no way an owner could, like, make sense of it. So I'm not trying to, but is there, like, how does one transfer source code information, right?

### You (2025-12-15T15:11:44.932Z)

It's just a file.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:11:45.168Z)

There's like. It's justifiable.

### You (2025-12-15T15:11:47.012Z)

The source code is? Yeah, I mean. It's saved to a repository.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:11:51.408Z)

Same way you transfer a Word document, Diane. You copy paste it into a and onto an SD USB drive. And send it over to them. And they'll have to use a Microsoft Visual Studio. They'll have to use a product, an ide, and an integrated development environment to open it and view it. Like, you can't just click on it and view it. Maybe it'll come up as a notepad text file, but it's worthless without that. But, yeah, it's just a file. Just like a Word document. It's just that you just drag it in and there it is.

### You (2025-12-15T15:12:19.732Z)

Yeah, but you can't. It would take a software engineer to actually make it work to you. If you were to open up that file, you would just see lines and lines, you know, a thousand rows of gibberish.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:12:32.528Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-15T15:12:33.092Z)

Because it's all in code. It's not.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:12:35.008Z)

Okay? Got it. All right.

### You (2025-12-15T15:12:36.372Z)

Yeah, so.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:12:38.288Z)

Well, it's so much better if we don't have to pay them, because that means we can use funds to advance. Like what you're working on, Howard, versus paying your for something that's in the past. So I guess that's good. Then we just go forward with what you got what you guys have suggested over the weekend, right? Two options. One is they get the code and we don't get the code. But we feel like that's fine. We're going to have a better product based on what you're working on. And they get no money. Or second, they get Drew's reimbursement. We'll just call it 10K. Right, but the code is deleted on both sides. Is that where we stand right now? Now, these. These are opening offers, right? So they're going to counter. They're just not going to accept. If they. If they accept, if they want to go down option one with no money. Then. There's not much to counter, right? It's. There's no money. You get the co. It's. It was basically sort of what he was laying out for me. Like, he. He said, they don't want money, they want the co, you know, so could they counter and say, well, we want the code. And we want $4,000 to reimburse me for, you know, whatever, you know. But. If they pick number two, meaning, you know, epoxy in both houses. We're just going to split the baby, you know, note. We're going to split the baby in half, and no one's going to really get the baby and no one gets the code. Then they're not interested in pursuing this. Idea. Obviously, they just want to make sure that you are set back. Or they probably think, well, you guys can't pursue it either without the. Without the code because you don't have the resources to start it up again, is probably what they're thinking. They may say, like, well, I can see Mark saying, well, because we say, here's 10 grand you divvied up however you want. And they're going to be marks and be like, hey, I need something out of this. You know, so, you know, pay us 15 grand. Or, you know, they're going to counter in another number. If they went with option two, but option one, I would think, is the least counterable. They may just say, fine, we'll go with option one. And then we'll, you know, they may say we want the code and we want this PowerPoint deck. Or, you know, you know, they may start. They can, they can have all that stuff, you know, and, and, and the only thing they can have and it's, and, and that they. Tried to play any claim to it. It's the same argument that they had is if they can't have the Invest name, they can't have the domain, they can't have the dot, because that's all registered under Dynams in it. Diane paid for that. So for the same logic that Drew is like, oh, I paid for the code. It's mine. Diane can say, well, I paid for InnVestAI and all this stuff. That's mine, you know? But he didn't claim they just wanted the. I think they just want the code.

### You (2025-12-15T15:14:45.492Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:15:37.488Z)

So should we simply do that? Ben Sherman just literally saying,

### You (2025-12-15T15:15:39.172Z)

That's. That's why I was just going to suggest. Why don't we just start there? And then also, there's one thing I wanted to run past you. I know Diane sent the message about whether or not they can go out in bad mouth or would they be perceived as winning.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:15:55.568Z)

No. So he. He even. He even raised before. Got off the rails. He raised something about a non disparagement clause, so.

### You (2025-12-15T15:16:03.332Z)

That's exactly what I was going to say. Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:16:05.088Z)

So. And I will modify because that's the one, you know, I, after I sent the email to you guys, because I'm like, I know there's one more clause I want to add. Confidentiality, you know, this. Then I will add to that. And you know, customer non spiritual call. So you have, you have confidentiality. So they're not even allowed to discuss the settlement outside of neither. Right? Right. No one can go to Drift except to say if it if, because I don't think they sent that letter to Driftwood. So, Jeff, I don't think Driftwood knows there's this conflict yet, so it's not like Driftwood's going to say. So what's going on with you and Mark and. And Drew? You can, you know, if someone were to ask, you could just say that's been settled in terms of confidential. That's all you can say? So I. I agree. Let's not give them. To.

### You (2025-12-15T15:16:06.452Z)

Because. Yeah. Right. Which is fine. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:16:57.248Z)

Options to pick from. Let's just go with the first one, the no money, and I'll and I'll even massage the email to say hey, in line with what you proposed on the phone. After they thought about it a while, you know, I think they think that's an acceptable option. This is what we propose. And basically, it's like, you could have everything. Nobody's going to exchange hands. Here's the code. Here's the data. Or we'll destroy the data. Anything. You want the name, right? Because the name makes you keep the name. All. All that will stay with Howard and Diane is the llc. The investa ailc and the name. And then we can go from there. That may be acceptable to them. That would be great. And then it's just we're going to. One of us is going to draft up a settlement agreement and then the other side will review it and redline it and blah, blah, blah. And once that's done it's. Signed and it's over. And then you guys, you know, we can start over. So two things. We have Vinod. Would have to. I don't know if he would. I. It would make me feel more comfortable. If he signed off as well. Probably make him more comfortable. Because they're what then they could. In that agreement, they're waiving any claims that they would have against him. Right. So if he doesn't sign the settlement agreement, if he's not part of the settlement agreement, no one's waived anything. Against the note. So I think Vinod wants to be in disagreement, and we could. He's the one that physically has the copy, right, Howard? I mean, do you don't actually have a physical copy of the code?

### You (2025-12-15T15:18:38.452Z)

No through the physical copy is going to reside. On the nodes. Well, more than likely. Everybody uses GitHub, which is kind of like a Dropbox for code, right? So. There's a couple ways that we would probably do that. If that's the case, all he has to do is share the GitHub, just like he would in Dropbox. And then you can basically make a copy of that. So one thing I think we need to do is, I think, you know, we're entitled right now. We should get that login or he needs to make that what they call public right now, so, you know, it's saved there. But it's probably only available to Vinod and the Offshore devs.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:19:35.088Z)

I would. In the. In the. In the short term, since I don't. There's no further progress on this code, right? Don't. Don't have them. Right? Any code. Right. Because assume it's going to them.

### You (2025-12-15T15:19:41.732Z)

Right. Well. Should be. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:19:45.808Z)

Tell. I would have a note of the Offshore people, prepare the code in the easiest packaged up way that they would be able to share and ship it off to someone else. That's what I would get them on board with. Like get whatever, you know, whatever they need to do to. If it's, get it put. A new. Create a new thing in GitHub or whatever to say this is going to be the public one that's going to be shared with the other side. Fine. And then. But the other thing is, after the settlement, Or, you know, even as part of this, you can get a sense of it. Sounds like the nodes out. And you got to know that, too, ahead of time, because you guys need to know what you're getting into. Is he going forward or not? It's not the end of the world if he's out. As I said at the very beginning, one of the very first things, as you know, that I raise you guys when you're like, vano can't do this full. And I'm like, well, why do you need them? Like, he's the guy running the offshore team. Diane, you know, I have that contact in the hospitality industry that's got the Filipino team that, you know, and if we need another offshore team, I have contacts or that. That we can get another offshore team in place. And that's. That's not an issue. Howard, is it fair to say that we are operating from the prospective right now, that the node is voluntarily withdrawn? That. It's just. It's. He was at a different point in his life when he wanted to move forward with this. Last year, that's changed. And we're going to figure and. And if he wants to come back in some way.

### You (2025-12-15T15:21:08.692Z)

That? Yeah. That? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:21:14.768Z)

Then those personal relationships are still good. We still love Vinod, right? But we don't. We are under working under the assumption that he is voluntarily. We can even build into the settlement agreement. That's what I want to know. What? The node wants to do that. Also, the node relinquishes all rights to his InnVestAI stuff. Like, if he wants out, we get we're just going to settle in agreement is going to refer to all of you as the InnVestAI parties. I would imagine we're not going to say, like plain there's not a lawsuit, so it's not plaintiff's defendants. You know, on the way, I'M envisioning it would be like just listing all five of you as the invent. There's a dispute amongst the InnVestAI parties. They want to resolve this. And so this is what's going to happen. Mark, Andrew have these rights. They get this boom, boom, boom. Diane and Howard get these rights. This is this. And then, you know, another section about relinquishing rights to InnVestAI, Mark, Drew, and if Vinod wants to all three of them carve those three out, they're out of InnVestAI. But Vinod doesn't get anything like. Like, because Mark and Drew will get the code. You guys would. Get the domain. And Vinod's like, just out. But it sounds like that's what he wants. He's like, I don't want anything to do with any of this. And I'm just out and. But lock him down on that. I'm not. I don't want to hold up. The settlement because of that. In worst case, we'll just deal with the node afterwards. And say Vinod. Fine. If you want out, well, we can work on a separate agreement after the fact, like. All right. Vinod, you're a real interesting rights boom and you're out, you know, or whatever, so.

### You (2025-12-15T15:22:55.092Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:22:57.408Z)

And so, yeah, the only thing. And I. I would just. I just want to raise this. If Vinod is out and it becomes like, the three of us on the. On the call. I do want to revisit, Howard, our deal a little because, I don't know, you know, I assumed it was a four person. Deal. But I don't need Equal again and I don't need voting. It's just. I just. We should maybe revisit that. But other than that. So what I will do today.

### You (2025-12-15T15:23:14.932Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:23:27.488Z)

Probably shortly after this call. If I, if I don't get to it before my 10:30, I will get to it this afternoon because I'm just booked solid through, like, noon. After this, I will send Aaron the email. I will just offer the one offer. I'll add the non asparaging. You know it's going to include a non sparring, Carlos. Which protects them, too. I mean, if I'm drew, I want confidentiality for sure, because I don't want you telling my customers what I just did with their data. And Aaron poo pooed this. He goes, I don't care. I'm like, I don't care. You care? I'm. Sure your client cares, you know, because I raised that as well. I'm like, when he started throwing fraud, I'm like, you're not. You guys don't have clean hands. You. You drew sharing customer data. I'm sure they don't want their data shared for non hotel bis business purpose and. That was when Aaron was in his just talking over me, like, constantly. He said, I don't care about that. I'm just like, well, I'm not sure Drew would have the same, you know, cavalier attitude about that. But because he knows that, because Drew has told you, don't say anything. I think you told me that. That he's like, don't tell anyone or don't. He knows he screwed up or he's doing something he's not supposed to. And. And so I think he wants to. He wants all the same clauses you do, so I will send that over to them. They should respond this week. I mean, it's Monday. If they don't, that's nuts. And we'll. We'll just go from there. Hopefully they're like, yeah, that's agreeable to them. Because we to them, they're going to say, and this is totally fine. There's no saving face in this. To them, they're going to think you guys have totally capitulated, you're giving them everything. Fine. That's the fastest way to. In the cheapest way, you know. As long as there's no money in exchange, it's the fastest way to get them out of your hair. And then you just move on and start over. And the other thing I would suggest is why Delaware, right? Why did you pick. Delaware. You're in Georgia. You're you don't have any connection to Delaware. Delaware has fees that other. Other. But I'm already down the road. But can we can we maybe just pause on that? Because is that all right? And but we'll talk about that. But so all right, so that's the plan, right? You're when you have time today, you will re redraft that email with just the one option, the non disparate language trying to get this settled this week. And then obviously we have to reconvene about other things like if it's a three, if this is a three person project versus a four person project. But in fairness to Howard, Howard has asked for a little bit of time too, to just step back and like, breathe. I think over the next two weeks. It's the 15th of December. It's been a hard year. It's been a particularly hard three weeks. And so. I, I think I wouldn't do anything before the holiday. I would just read reset after the holidays. I mean, get this set on, focus on the settlement before. Yeah, January. That's what I'm saying. It's like, you know, we refocused the first week of January and we just kind of let everyone have the next two weeks to just breathe, think, right? And me, too. I am thinking about how, you know, alternative ways to push something like this to. Or to move something like this to market. So I have some of that on my own plate to do.

### You (2025-12-15T15:26:33.812Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:26:56.048Z)

Howard. Did I. Did I say that correctly? I mean, it's. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-15T15:26:58.532Z)

Oh, no, that's fine. Yeah, Like I said, I've been tinkering around with. The. New and improved version. Which I'm going to do anyway because I'm bored. But, yeah, just to kind of go through the holidays without. You know, added stress. But I. I'm going to reach out to the node, and he's usually pretty open on Mondays. I'm going to have a talk with him. You know, number one, I want to make sure he's aware that. That we have to have access to the code. GitHub. Another thing that I just thought of is if they have been working on this after that meeting. GitHub versions, everything. I'm going to request that he roll back to anything that was done after the 25th. Mike, do you think that. 's good or bad or indifferent.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:28:07.008Z)

I, I I mean, I don't want you getting in like I don't want I'm. I would. Find out if there are later versions, what was done. If it's like, oh, we can commented the code or we did that, you know, fine. I you because you don't want to get an argument like you didn't give us the current version or you you like you you're now giving them some other way to come at you because they're like, wait a minute, this isn't the latest version. You know, you arbitrarily pick the date that you were going to give me the code. You know, I would. It was pretty clear, too, on the. On the 25th, when we talked, he was, I mean. He was crystal clear. He said vinod. That means the offshore engineering team stops working.

### You (2025-12-15T15:28:23.092Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:28:43.328Z)

Period. Howard, do you remember? He was very. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-15T15:28:44.212Z)

Yeah. Oh, yeah. I've got the transcript. Tell you word for word what he said.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:28:49.168Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-15T15:28:52.052Z)

No, you're right.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:28:53.328Z)

All right, well, I will. And I will let you know what I will send it. At some point. And when I do, I will forge you what I sent so you'll know I sent it and what I sent. And then I'll let you know, you know, when they respond. All right. I would hope they want to get this wrapped up. I don't want to set your expectations, but I would hope they would want to get this wrapped up before the holidays as well. So if, like, there, there's if they accept it and we're and their lawyers, like, you know, responsive there's no reason why this can't get done before, you know, the holidays, so. All right, guys.

### You (2025-12-15T15:29:32.372Z)

Great.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:29:34.768Z)

Talk to you later. Yep. Thanks.

### You (2025-12-15T15:29:34.852Z)

O. Kay. All right. See ya.

### Guest (2025-12-15T15:29:36.768Z)

Bye.
