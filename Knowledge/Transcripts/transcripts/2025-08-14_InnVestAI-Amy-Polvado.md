# Transcript for: InnVestAI | Amy Polvado

### You (2025-08-14T14:31:09.516Z)

Good morning. How are you? Can hear you. Oh, yeah, it looks like you're.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:31:18.384Z)

No. I don't know why my settings. Every time I open scenes, I'm always muted. And I have no idea why some stupid setting that I have not had to stop and fix yet so but.

### You (2025-08-14T14:31:29.516Z)

Yeah, it's been a while since we chatted. It's probably been. Oh, man, I hate to say it, but probably a couple of years. Since.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:31:52.224Z)

Yeah. I think so.

### You (2025-08-14T14:31:54.076Z)

Last joined one of the meetings. Yeah. I've seen your posts. Looks like you've been pretty busy.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:01.504Z)

A little bit. Yes. I've been a little busy.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:08.864Z)

I'm starting my doctorate program August 25th.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:12.316Z)

Very nice. I went through that.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:14.304Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:14.956Z)

I went through that with my wife. She got the doctorate.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:17.744Z)

Oh, did she?

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:18.236Z)

I had to deal with it.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:20.624Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:21.276Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:24.064Z)

I'm not married. So I won't have that support, but that's okay.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:28.316Z)

It's an awful lot of work.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:28.544Z)

But it is an awful lot of work, for sure. I got some great kids. Hi. How are you? Hi.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:35.516Z)

Yeah. Good.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:36.224Z)

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:38.944Z)

Doing well.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:39.116Z)

That's what brought us to Dallas when we were living there. She got her a full ride at Texas Women's University. So how we ended up there.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:47.424Z)

Very cool. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-14T14:32:49.276Z)

And she worked on that. Took her about 10 years. She took her time.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:32:56.384Z)

Well, I'm hoping to get in. I've already have my master's degree. So I'm hoping to get in and out in three. That's my goal.

### You (2025-08-14T14:33:01.036Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:33:01.904Z)

We'll see. Amy, are you applying to a PhD program? Is that what I'm gathering? No, I'm already accepted. Okay? So. Yeah, I'm starting August 25th. I met Purdue is where my doctorate will be. From. Congratulations. That's very exciting. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

### You (2025-08-14T14:33:20.396Z)

Good. So appreciate you. Being able to join us. So purpose really is number one. I want to introduce Diane and Amy and let you guys kind of chat it out. Get a little bit of background. As I mentioned, I know both of you are involved in women and leadership and different types of initiatives like that. But also Diane and I have been involved in a prop tech startup. And Diane, amy is the founder. Really? Of the us prop tech council, and I was semi involved in that.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:34:00.624Z)

Yes. That's wonderful.

### You (2025-08-14T14:34:03.916Z)

Way back at the very beginning. But my other job took me elsewhere. And I didn't really have a chance to keep up with it. So it's been a couple years since Amy and I have last spoken.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:34:15.904Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-14T14:34:16.316Z)

But anyway, I thought maybe, Diane, if you want to kind of give Amy a little bit of background and you guys can take it.

### Guest (2025-08-14T14:34:19.744Z)

Yeah. That's great. It's all right if I give you a little bit of background about myself? And then we can pivot over and you can share some background about yourself. And then we'll talk about kind of what we're each doing. I did do a little bit of research. The digital twin piece of your work is very interesting. I attended a few webinars that Oscar hosted when I was at CBRE about digital twins. So it's interesting to see the technology change, and that really is a leading. Right. Technology change for real estate. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. It'll be interesting over the next couple of years, just more and more people start to embrace it. And how powerful it can be. Yeah. It's great. And I am from the real estate industry as well. But I have been commercial real estate, specializing in hospitality in my career. I have about 25 years, and it's been mostly institutional investments. And I've been an acquisition person and asset management person, a portfolio management person. I've been on the sponsor side of the house. So I feel like I have tried my hand at every discipline within hotel, commercial, state investment. And coming out of that. I did some work in third party Asset management, where the two companies I worked at had tried their hand at creating a business intelligence platform for hotel investments. And they were both, as it turns out, led by the same gentleman. His name is Jalil McCor. He's now in the middle. East. He was in the Middle east for a long time with jll. But he has started a platform over there called Inhovate. And he's doing something similar in the Middle east. What we're doing here. But I moved to CBRE then and I spent two years at CBRE putting together a proposal for them. It was very deep on how we at CBRE could invest in a third party operational BI company. Called Otellier and essentially take their platform and turn part of it around. And pivot it Howard the investment side of the sector. So create digital underwriting, digital deal management. And then the digital side of asset management as well. That is where you need to connect your data and your returns. Through investment, through operations. Up through reporting to investors. Like the whole digital connection piece of it. I worked very hard. I worked with the lead software engineer for Global Valuations, and he taught me so much. About what was going on in the space. I also got to work with the lead, Global business analytics. Person on the occupier side of the space. So this is retail and office leasing. He taught me so much. And I went into CBRE with my mind set like this is a closed system. Kind of like the old school, right? And two years later, I walked out with a completely different understanding. It's like, oh, no, this is a very open system. It's all about how you connect. To other systems. And you go and collaborate with other systems to pull data back and forth. And interact workflows. So you are really providing the best service for your client. Sadly, CBRE hospitality was just not a property type that was big enough for CBRE to make this that. So I left. I was a bit brokenhearted about it. And right at the time. As I was leaving, they announced they made $125 million investment in VTS, which is a very big occupier retail platform. Right. So they did believe in the concept. Just they weren't ready to deploy it. In any scale at hospitality. And since I left cbre, I've been working to try to get this off the ground. Myself. And part of that. Was networking. When I did my research, I researched Red IQ up and down, right? Because they were the leading AVM provider on the multifamily side. I study everything I could about them. And then one of my hotel colleagues joined Berkadia to head up, or not quite had up be second. In their hotel brokerage platform. And Berkadia owned red iq at the time. So my hotel colleague made the introduction to Howard. Howard and I started to chat about ABMs because we don't have an AVM in the hospitality space. It's actually, our data is very complex. It's very bespoke. It's structured in a different way. And really, our acquisition models all date back to hvs. Back in the 1980s, and it hasn't changed in 40 years. This is something that to say I'm passionate about this is an understatement. I just feel we need this. And no one is going to do this. Probably other than the group that we've assembled here. And so it's really, really important that we get this off the ground. And we're having wonderful success getting through the POC and the mvp, which we can talk about. But I found power. And then, Howard, the story about or how we'll fill you in for Kadia sold Red IQ to Radix. And then for certain reasons, That didn't work out. And Howard was available to market. And so in January, we were talking, and I convinced him to partner with me. And do this in the hospitality space. So looking back now that I see all the value that Howard has brought from the product management perspective, I've realized how naive I was thinking that I could do this. Not myself. But with maybe just one other person. Because I've literally seen him. Create the product and he brought with him. Archief technology officer who is also with Berkadia and Red iq. So we have two of our technology leaders from the multifamily technology space who have successfully built and monetized an avm, which adds huge validation and credibility to what we're doing. And the hospitality side. Then I have brought two people to the table. One is a gentleman named Mark Gordon, and Mark was a former hotel broker. For a company called Son of Looking, Goldman, and then Cushman and Wakefield, and then he's a hotel developer. And he's also a tech investor. So he's really important because he puts. He's the validation in capital markets. For us. Right. He's the deal guy. He's the deal junkie. He's the one who's done it. And has the face of capital markets. And then last, a gentleman named Drew Wallace, who. I met when I was at cbre, and he's done a really great job of getting in. And mapping hotel management companies against each other. And essentially pulling their data into a unified data source. And he works more on the asset management side. But because he has such depth of knowledge. With the management companies. He's partnered with us. So it's kind of a big co founding team. But. But works really well for us because we have all the key players. We have without any capital. At this point, developed a poc. We're 25% through the mvp. Which was really a good progress. For progress. Now on aws. And we're working through. We've worked through the security sign on and we're working through some of the front end pieces of the avm. We are September we are going to start seeking precede capital. And we're going to break up the pre seed funding. Into first a much smaller round of Call it somewhere. I'll call it like 300, $400,000. That will help get us. I'll call it maybe like, six or eight months. We have two clients identified right now. We believe we're going to enter through the debt. And structured finance space because it's a faster underwriting and speed is incredibly important. It's also a higher level underwriting. So we have a company called the Peachtree Hotel Group that made Beta for us. And be one of our first clients. And Access Point Financial is also interested in being a beta. So we believe that we'll have clients unsure how monetizing they'll be. Right. Because they're going to be beta clients that will turn into monetizing clients. But it's good that we're already having those conversations. And then once we get some revenue in place, or at least really good feedback from the beta clients, Then we'll proceed with the balance of our seed funding and still probably break it into two additional rounds. Before. We then launch out. So we have two, two and a half years of work ahead of us. And we feel good where we are with the mvp. Really solid on the AVM component of it. And now we are working into it. And Howard has done a ton of work on this. How we're going to bring AI into our workflows. To make it incredibly helpful for our customers. And with our client feedback. We will also decide what additional workflows then we want to follow with I. E. The legal side of the business is being digitized very rapidly. Like legal workflows. And that's a big piece of hotel acquisitions. And then the capex side. So now kind of getting back to the digital twin. Piece of what you're doing. Right. The Capex side of hotel renovations. It's very brand driven. Right. So there are a lot of standards. Around it. A lot of structure. The Berends dictate what needs to be renovated and what doesn't. It's a very formal process. But. It's a very old school manual process. Right. So we're still talking Excel email. It's a big thing to do a virtual property improvement tour with an iPad. Know. So there's lots of potential room to bring technology into the mix and improve it. Which will be. I think that will be a game changer. For hospitality investments as well. But I don't want to get too ahead of myself. Because we're going to want. To put on my laptop. It was about to die. Oh, that's the worst, isn't it? Where you're, like, looking down. And you're like, okay. How many minutes? Do I have? Before. I go completely black. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Keep going. I'm good. I was listening. But last is we know for sure. The pipeline management and the AVM is desperately needed. And we know that the capital market. We're getting great capital markets reception. So once we start working with real clients, then we're going to make sure we understand what the clients want. As their next workflows. Which may be different than what we think the clients want, but we feel good that we can at least get to. I mean, if you look at the market overall host between hotel brokers. All the fees that they earn, hotel owners. And all the asset management fees. And acquisition fees that they earn. Hotel lenders. Mortgage brokers, appraisers. Feasibility consultants. It's a two billion dollar industry of fees. Being earned around hotel transactions. Right. So if we can just tap into it. A tiny bit. We believe that we could easily get to 30 or 50 million in ARR and possibly really then exceed that. If we can find solid workflows. To improve for our customers. And let's see. I talked about again? The two billion dollar industry. Oh, this is the last thing I wanted to say. The way we see the product working is initially it is pipeline management and avm, and then it moves into. Then we're working on the AI, right? And then, as Howard says, the workflow automation is great. But it's the data. That really is the gold here. Right. It's the aggregation of the data. And so that's going to be a really big part of our strategy. Because we could be the first resource to actually be able to obtain real hotel cap rate information on transactions. With an AVM and then connecting into the closing process. And then last, taking a cue from what VTS has done, try to move into more of a marketplace. So think five years out. It's a virtual marketplace. And we're the platform that people are transacting on. Brokers still play a huge role, obviously. Because they're creating the competition and working with the potential investors. But we've. Automated the data piece of it. For them. And really taking that off of their plate. Which they're not the best at doing that. Anyway. And created a much better solution. For the industry. So that's our vision. That's our plan. I'm not a techy, I'm a practitioner. So the fact that I am co founding a tech startup with Howard and others, my husband almost thinks that's funny. Because it's so low tech, but I'm doing it for someone who is low tech, like me. Right. And I believe that there is so much automation out there. I don't want people to have to work 20 hours a day. Or 18 hours a day. And go through what I have gone through the last 20 or 25 years. So that's a little bit about my background and why this is so important. To me. And how fortunate I feel to have found Howard and Vinod and our other two partners. Who balance out me on the hotel side. From a deal perspective and then from a more detailed data perspective. Very cool. Yeah. That's great. That's a good, great background. Okay? So a little bit about me. I'm also a tech founder that has no technical capabilities. And I'm the product person. So I came from real estate development. Actually, I started when I started my career in real estate. I was a general contractor. And so I was a commercial. Had a commercial construction company that I founded. Initially, we were building retail stores. And then we got into more to family and then I became a private equity real estate firm. And 2008. And then started did that for a long time. And had that company. So I syndicated Zeals and I had a fund and I did all of that. I did mixed use projects. I did some hospitality, but more on the hospitality side. I wasn't the vertical developer. I was supposed to horizontal. So the acres of land I do all the horizontal development, sell off the lots to the hospitality guys. Right. So I know the franchise side. Michael Handy is based on Austin. He's a great guy. I don't know. I can't remember which hotel change where people are a bit clean as well as developers, because that's what he does. Because the developers. Hey, we should build whatever. Here. Right. That's kind of the thing. Yeah, so that was my experience in hospitality. I do know several folks in it. Though. Because of the. Because I started the Project Council. So a couple of stories. Long time real estate developers. Became a Prospect founder because I got super frustrated. With the lack of available data. For me to manage my investment. And so similar story around the mind was on building performance. I just didn't have the data I needed from the building side. Didn't move the needle to make alpha on the funds, investments or the syndications we were doing, and it just really was super frustrating. So same kind of thing. I will say there's lots of people chasing the automation around valuations. I mean, I know hotels are different game. And that's great. We're just buying on hotels. So I've got a front row seat under the tech. Being built. And generally have last conversations with startups brand new do this. We help the council helps with helps. We'll help you capitalize or connect you with customers. It's just an ecosystem. Right. So we have universities. We have real estate companies, we have a startups, like 450 startups. In the council and some investors. That are in the council because they're looking for startups to invest in. So that was the goal, just to create this ecosystem. That's what the Council, my company facilitates. Does. Digital Twins. But we build out. And this is what you'll run up against as well. Is we build out the digital twin as the data source. But like every real estate company, You can't just give them the data. Because they don't know what to do with it. They don't have data scientists on staff, so you actually end up having to build. Functionality on top of your data source. I mean, cherries. Cherry's gotten away with a little bit. As a so generic they have a really good data sources. So people will do it because it's super generic and it's kind of like another co star. But just needs a better data. Totality. Same thing. They have a bunch of data embedded, they're facing the same problem is like. So they're having to build solutions on top of their data sets so people can use it. Right. So all the data people are differently. So that's what we started building. So we started building site selection tools. Based off of the data that we select, we built a commercial real estate transaction portal. So that, like, the. The process from contract to close. Like managing that craziness. Our data is for the main four parties, which is the buyer, the lender, the insurance company in the appraiser with our data and same thing. So we built a portal. To kind of manage that process. So you'll find that. As you kind of progress through, you'll see we're not really chasing the whole space. Y'all can have it. I don't, but I just know people in it. We're focused on data centers. That's where we're at, and that's where we're sitting. That's a great space. To be focused in right now. We're busy. And we had to pivot there. Because originally started multifamily, because those are the people I knew. But that's nice to have, but I can't see making that amount of an investment into it. Yet. It's probably because they were just getting hammered. They couldn't make their mortgage payment. Right. So I pivoted to the data center industry because they have clinic hash, and it's not a hard sell for them. They get the value of the data. They get the value of the software. And so that's why, I mean, that there. But no, I think hospitality industry is every industry in the real estate. Every sector is right for disruption. Like everyone. But my suggestions to you would be, obviously, hone your data. Get it. Great. Get a cto or leave. Don't build it on the wrong tech stack. Don't make mistakes that I did. But it sounds like you've got a good cto. But you start your integration with an LLM now because they can do like ChatGPT 5 is tensor powerful and it can do a lot of stuff for you that you don't need to do some development, you don't need to spend time developing it. Because chat should be T5 can already do it. Right. So as long as you've got a great proprietary data source. And you can. Or you can build out a proprietary data source like that. Building an integration with fat or broth or clog or any of them. Is probably the best way to go. As far as the functionality that you use. So you'll see that in your development times or strength comparatively to where we had to be five years ago. And then also on your raise. You're going to run into brick wall unless you have customers. So the vc game has changed. Game has changed. Brent, you could probably be friends and family, and that would be totally fine. But there's no. Angel investors are not angel investors anymore. They're not selling it on an idea. So the people at. You're talking to your betas. Have them sign contracts. Because paper is gold. And that's what I had to learn. Is in 23 and 24. I was getting Beta customers. But I wasn't having to sign anything. And so that didn't mean anything. So don't make that mistake that I did, okay? Get customers, assign contracts. Maybe give them an extended pre period. 90 days, 6 months. Who cares to get them to sign? But eventually they will turn into a paying customer. And that is worth money. Is that you can count as revenue. Even though it's half the revenue you're doing. But what you're going to say when you write the contract is a contract is 100 grand a year. But for the first six months, I'm going to discount it. To something. But the contract itself is worth 100 brand. And then the different. Is that accounting? It's an accounting trick. You write the discount to book the income. You write the discount on a separate line. And so they look at the income. So you just need to understand, when you're writing your SaaS contract, you got to do it that way. And that way to an investor. I was like, oh, they've got 100 grand income. For you. They're just. Making doing discounts to get certain customers. That's okay. Right. So that's what I would do. Right. And that way you'll be more investment worthy. But it's going to be tough. Because you're going to have a tough road right now. There's just not a lot of release date investors. Not. There's some, but if you can figure out a way to bootstrap it. For another year or so. We're going to get a better investor when you're going to get a better valuation. And it could be. I mean, I've been bootstrapping mine for six years. Right. So I've not taken one investor yet. And I've just figured out a way to do it. I partnered my way there. I. I did do all the development. I found a partner who'd already done it, and we just worked together, and I licensed her stuff. And I licensed it. As I sold it to a customer. So like a mutual reseller. They're not paying anything. So you can find ways to do that. So you're not having to spend a lot of development. Really days? I said some. I've probably spent about. I don't know. Maybe 50, 60 grand. And that's all I spent to get to the product, to where it is today. That's it. In your 60 grand. Wow. That's great. And it's because I partnered with people, and we had an intern come in. And our intern built our integration tool. And so we, as we partner with somebody else, They can integrate. Because we've created this integration to where as we license a new tech or we're going to bring it in, it's super easy. And we knew we were going to aggravate a bunch of data anyway. But that was, like, the best thing, and our intern was free. Right. He's great. He's a computer scientist. And he just wanted something on his resume. And we're like, we're gladly. Give you something on your resume, man. This is awesome. So you just have to learn to be scrappy. Early days. But you're going to run into unless you have revenue or contractors. Signed with people, you're not going to get an investor. So just. I just try and prepare you. But when you're ready and you've got some of that, I have some people that are part of the council that help raise for people. And they can do that. Got it. So when we have customers. Where we can actually show that we book them. You booked income, you have traction. You have a sales pipeline. Behind it. Not like I've got two customers. That's all we had. You've got verifiable leaser and actually by blind like, these are the people we talk to, this is the people we've demoed to. These are people in negotiations. Contracts. Like you can show your sales. What it is. And you truly know your numbers around our sales cycle is 14.2 months. Are that and you can talk to an investor. That way. Because you've kind of figured all of that out. Then you're more investable. That's what you just have to prove more. Now. And that's just the way. And that's the way it's going to be. Because AI will. It's going to change the game in the VC world. Like AI's changes. All of it. Because the development side is so you can I have a friend of mine. Who is building 25 AI products in under 30 days. And he's doing. He's already built 12. What does he say? In real estate or in another industry? Yeah. No, in real estate. And so he's using AI to build out products super fast. It's called project project 25. AI, it's joe birdie grace here at austin. And he uses AI to create products, and he can do it, really, so. The VCs are going to get wind of that. Goes. Your taking a year to create your product. Right. You got to just understand, this is the game now, and it's completely changing and turning on its head, and it's not the same as it was even two months ago. It's totally different. A question. So we've been. I mean, we've really been spending a lot of time on AI as well. And a lot of our potential customers are also having their teams, like, spend time. On. AI right. Like Claude is a wonderful underwriting tool, right? Look at what it can do. In financial analysis. Pretty much every single one of our customers has someone on their team playing around with the various AI platforms. Right now. So we are going to need to figure out how to overcome that objection, if that makes sense. Well, why do we need you? Because we can just go do this ourselves. Right. And clearly part of it is the data aggregation, because the more data that we can accumulate by having multiple groups use our platform, then they can share in that benefit as well. By having better comparable data, right? That's a part of it. In the hospitality industry that is unique because our data is different. I mean, once you get down to the noi line, Financial analysis is financial analysis. But getting to the noi line is a very complex thing to do that is unique to hospitality. Assumes that the hotel customers that you're talking to. Don't know how to do that. They do. So they could just. Hey, 20 bucks. To chat gpt5 and teach chat. To do that underwriting. Yeah. So that's at the end. That's exactly what you're up against. So unless you have some special data source or some special knowledge that they don't have, And you can teach a model to do. Chatgpt5 will never be able to do it because it doesn't know that knowledge. But as soon as it's been just that knowledge. It will. So that's what you got out of your position yourself today. Is either we have some data and you don't have, and therefore Chad GPT5 will never have it. And you will never get the best underwriting ever. Our algorithm is just so much better. Than anything Chat is going to produce or Groker Clod or whoever that. Yeah. If you want to trust that AI, great. And you might make the wrong investment. Or you can get a better algorithm, better underwriting to us because we actually know what the we're doing. Those kinds of things. And I will say, depending on the customer you're talking to, like, if it's Starwood, they probably had a team full of analysts. Doing this. And they know what they're doing. Right. But if it's a smaller play, like a regional player. Like a Patel or somebody. I don't know what to put the Patels. But they have, like, who are these people? They own so many restaurants. How many hotels? Like I have a friend. His last name is because the name Smith. I think the patellas are like lots of Smiths. But why are they all become home tele owners? Like. I don't know. I can't say this because my buddy is D. Chant Patel. And he's out of new york. And he owns on the eastern seaboard. And I give him hell all the time. Like how many of your cousins? He's like, amy, shut up. I know. Yes, yes. You're all part of AHOA too, which is an important organization. For us. To penetrate. But he's a great guy. Good dudes. Took me out on my birthday. During Covid when I came to new york. She's like, Amy, I'm taking her Tanner.fox Like, all right. Let's go. Over to hudson yards. And I was a great, great guy. But yeah. So I think it's so maybe depending on who your ICP is. It might be beneficial. You might not chase the rates, right? You might notice institutional players. Maybe you chase the, you know, the fairly large regional players that might not have the access to the data or the team that those folks have. And then you think you can just say, hey, you can play like the big boys. That could be a work, you guys. You can play the like the big boys with our software. Right. Right. Whatever. So yeah. So it really just depends. But have you been to high tech yet? I have not personally been to high tech, but obviously I know high tech respect high tech as a conference. Right. It's where all the hospitality technology professionals go. And it's more on the. I think the one thing that maybe it's not super unique. But all the technology and hospitality is focused around operations. There's really no technology focused around real estate. Right. And so that puts us in a class that I'm sure we'll start to fill up quickly. We already do have some competitors. Out there. We have competitors in two areas. On the real estate side, some that are trying to go after just the asset management space, the operational asset management space. And then we have some that our former brokers and are saying, well, hey, if I build a technology platform, Maybe I can put brokers out of business, essentially by just creating a better CRM. Kind of doing what you're doing. Like connect people without the need for broker in that very high brokerage fee. Those latter groups, though, to our understanding, have not included any kind of underwriting. Into their platform. S. At this point, they're just acting more as like a CRM or a pipeline sourcing type of software. So we're hoping there may be an opportunity even to do some partnerships with them. Right. Because if you essentially connect in with an avm, that allows you to go faster, faster, faster. And whoever. For you. That kills your tan, right? So you're investing with one broker. I mean, basically, over time. Those kind of marketplaces. You're not going to put out the rest of the brokers company, they're just going to go get another software solution. To solve that problem. Well for you. You want to be the A and B institution for. All right. Can I right. You know what I mean? So you don't want to tie yourself to one horse. Sorry. Howard. We're just chatting and you're listening. I swear you're going to get a moment.

### You (2025-08-14T15:06:43.836Z)

No, that was the whole purpose of the call is to connect the two of you together. So looks like she may have hit. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-14T15:06:50.144Z)

Your wife is a PhD. Is that what I'm gathering? I didn't realize that. Well, look at you guys. You're a very smart family.

### You (2025-08-14T15:06:57.916Z)

She is. She's got the brains. I just think I just survived on street smarts. Was having such a hard time. This morning. Waking up. My eyes are burning like allergies. In here. Hey there.

### Guest (2025-08-14T15:07:23.104Z)

Another plug. Pay attention to it. I thought it plugged it in. I think so. We're on my phone. I got to pay attention to your devices and their power levels.

### You (2025-08-14T15:07:37.196Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-14T15:07:40.144Z)

Anyway. But yeah. So you just as you figure out where your niches or who your custom what your customer segments are, I mean, I think that's where your kind of. We're honing.

### You (2025-08-14T15:08:04.156Z)

Sorry. Amy, you're breaking up there. I don't think we got the whole.

### Guest (2025-08-14T15:08:11.184Z)

That project didn't work. Out. Okay? So as you kind of figure out what your niche is or who your ICP is and what you're going to go chase. And that might change if they're just for everybody. Yeah. Just be mindful of some of that. But if you've got some, like, I guess that's got the data and algorithm. We've got some proprietary data. Or better algorithm is to be okay. Should be able to be some of that. But I do agree. There's kind of space in the asset management. Area. And so I do think that you'll have a little bit of a bluer ocean there. For sure. But those guys are. Those guys are chasing the AI Integrations, too. And, like, just learning to. Not everybody is. Because I think a lot of the real estate companies are like, yes, we want to use AI, but we don't know the first step in doing AI. And so. And it might be some of that where you just initially going, yeah, you want to use our stuff. But maybe you become the. You become the. Like. Let's get you to AI. So you become the four hotels. There are all the big hotel people. You become their AI consultant and you can sell them your software, plus other things to get them kind of up and ready. To be or get them to be AI ready. That might be worth it. And that's the hardest part about being a prop tech company. And what I found, too. And I do it every day. Is you end up having. You're not just selling your software. You're selling consulting services. To that. Right. And that's what I ran into. And it was the easiest way for me to sell my software. Is by selling services. You don't want to do that long term because it messes with your valuation. S of your company. Initially, you have to do that. Because it's no way you're going to face. Customer adoption because they don't have anybody on the team. That knows how that user software. So initially, you then have to go, okay? Let's get you ready for us. I'm going to pay me five grand a month. Or six grand a month or whatever. To get you ready for us. And that means we got to go do all this data governance and manage and cleanup and look at your archaic systems. And how are we going to put something on top of this? Like. It's, like, written cobol and all these other things. That you're going to have to go do. So that's what we came up with initially and that's how we got our initial kind of strategic data people is because we came in goes they want to do AI. They all want to do AI. So let them go BB button for them. Let us come in and be your chief, your fractional tasks AI officer. Let us do that for you. And get you ready. Right. Right. So that values in your go to market. Initially is to do that. And this is going to be a very fortuitous thing because Howard has never heard me mention this before. But I met this wonderful young man. He was working at a company called Rabbit, which was. Well, you were a gc, so was project management at the developer level. Cash flows. And it was great. Software. When I was at Portman, I tried to get asked to use it. But Portman was just too old school to do anything. Like that. And he ended up going to a company called taylorbird, and he left Taylor Bird. But his vision is to create a consulting company. Where he helps companies with their text stacks, right? Connect A to B, B to C, C to D. And this vision that you know, it started from one of the first papers I read. By Pilabs, which is the end goal for our industry, is how do you connect end to end? Acquisitions to dispositions data completely through the system, right? So you're going from our AVM and our upfront capital markets. And acquisitions through closing to asset management Renovations. Up through. Right. The pair reviews and the Juniper squares. And you're connecting the data lineage. I'm going to introduce Mike to Howard and some of the others on our team because he has this vision. Of a consulting company, and he's trying to get it off the ground right now. And he's also a former project manager. So he has a lot of depth. In renovations. Which could be one of the next workflows we tackle. If we do get the customer feedback, that's a valuable workflow for automation and maybe something that they wouldn't have their financial analysts out there. All trying to figure out the sentence that Claude is a phenomenal financial analyst. I don't know that they're out there thinking, oh, my God. Claude can do A, B and C D. Connecting my renovation and construction and GC with my brand. With the brand. S right. And their unique requirements. So that's maybe just a coming attraction for Howard, is when I say, hey, Howard, I want you to meet Mike. You'll be like, oh, yeah. He's the guy. That wants to do the consulting business. Yes. For sure. Yeah. Well, Amy, how can we help you? Going forward. I mean, how can we stay on your radar screen? How can we help you? With your business. From the council perspective, we really want the hospitality kind of focus. It's kind of missing in the council. We've got health care, we've got multib family. We've got data centers. We got residential office, a little bit on the industrial, but not yet. But we'd really love a hospitality kind of center inside the council, and it doesn't exist yet. So if you all wanted to start actively participating, there. I think that would be okay. Also the council is great. Especially on the startup side, because we get to promote you. And we have these monthly webinars. All the time. And we build out relationships with the conferences. Right. So if we could build out a relationship with high tech where we go and we're a partner with them. I'm doing that with blueprint. In september. I do it with free tech. I do it with a lot of these. And real estate. Real estate organizations. We're becoming their technology arms. So ifma uli bomas. You know all the ones. Right. Nioc. So if there's a hotel, real estate, like, hotel organization that I should be partnering with, I just like to have an advisor in that kind of real estate sector going, hey, you need to partner with this group. You need part of that group. That would be great. That would be my ask. Is. I really want to build this. In there. And I know Maria Johnson. She's more on the real side. Not necessarily hotels, but I think it's all celestial. You have some people starting to do it. Do. You all wanted to help there, that would be great. That would be my answer. Through you on that. Or directly into the Council. Like, what's the best way for us? Join as a member, it would be great. You can pay 49 bucks a month or. $499 in the whole year. And it wants to become a member. Then we have these forums. That we had leaders, so pretty much everybody in the. It's a. It's a nonprofit crisis. It's all volunteer leg. So we have people leaning forums. Leading groups. Sectors. Dini Taylor leads to health care sector, but everybody values it. Just from a networking ecosystem perspective. A lot of deals get done inside of council, which is great. And you'll find other startups that might be working on something that you want to collaborate with on your site, right? Right. The whole goal. Steps being developed all the time. Of Salazar is doing a really cool AI thing. Around maintenance. And the hospitality industry tingling means this stuff. Like I can see. You can have somebody walk through a room, talk on the phone. And it'd preach worders. As they're talking on the phone. Like that. 's what his stuff says. It's super cool. And he does it for multifamily. About like, dude. You need to do that in hospitality. I know about. There's a lot of that that's sitting in there. That we had this hospitality kind of focus. You could cherry pick. Oh, no, that would be great. And so I think. I think there's more of that. Too. Even from a, you know, ar VR design we have. Sort of start up that's doing that. We had somebody doing virtual skating and early site planning. And using so our digital twin stuff can help you do site. Planning and you build out the model before your build a infrastructure around it. Power, water, the sewer, all of that. So there's a lot of crossover. And that's what we're trying to get. More real estate sectors playing long. And you can realize something that's being built for another sector that could be applied somewhere else. And that's what we're really trying to do. So I'd love health there, if you're willing to. Yes. Absolutely. We're willing to. We will join the council and get on your radar screen. Because I agree. I see so many things in multifamily, and I'm like, oh, the hospitality industry. Should do that. But hospitality. We sit on the island, of course. Also on my part, I would love to say, and Todd, with your digital twin business, because I really think that has not penetrated yet. The brand and the developers. And development is a bit on hold and hospitality because of where interest rates are. But hospitality is unlike any other property type because the Berends are what drive development. And its consumer demand. It's not really people aren't thinking through always the real estate side of it. It's so much driven by. I need to sign 100 new Hilton Garden in franchises. And so these franchise developers go out. And they. I mean, they almost create a market when the interest rates are conducive to doing something like that. So what I'm saying there is hotel development will get turned on at one point in the next few years. It's just in a lull now. And when it gets turned on, I'd love to have the ability to say, oh, look, are we all educated on digital twins? And what vests can do. For our next phase of development. Sure. So right now, what we're doing is we're building out a digital. It's really not a digital twin. Digital twins aren't just a render. Right. It's actually real lifetime data that's happening in. But before that happens, When you do need to build a rendering, right? And so we are doing that for Nvidia. For their data center models. So they want to be able to say, hey, the optimal data center to use Nvidia stuff is this. And they want to show it in a 3D model. So we're in the middle. Of doing that. That's one of our things. We can do the same thing through a hotel. Brand. Goes. This is all of our stuff. This is all of our materials you have to use. This is all the things. These are all our specs. It needs to look like this. You can get 1, 2 or 3. Here's your rendering. And then put on VR headsets and they can walk through the renderers. They go through and see what it looks like. Oh, I'd love to do that. That would be really super cool. You'll have somebody want to do that. I think, yes. Yeah. And I also saw on your website. I don't know if you're actively doing this, but the carbon footprint component of that is becoming in hospitality, it actually is becoming something because we're having to track. Our digital footprint for meeting planners. Right. And they are making decisions. Based on oh, dolls. Carbon footprint. And so one of the companies I'm collaborating with is a company called mineclip, and they track sustainable products used and renovations. And I could just kind of see a web of how all of this. Connect, right? We integrate with 25 people now. If we were to build out the model and track. Is there any construction what was after work on that? Thing. And we make it, do the calculation and we just bring it on. Right. Well, it was wonderful to meet you, and I look forward to getting to know you better. Congratulations. On your PhD program. That's incredibly exciting. Thanks. Yeah. Next three years, man. What's the program? What program are you interviewing? It's technology. Information technology. My thesis is going to be around on one of the problems with AI is and how AI is being built. So Obviously all the LLMs run on probably will be available data. But the next gen of AI is going to be on proprietary data. Yes. You're going to have to. You can't, like, follow the proprietary data around and build AI infancy tools everywhere. So how can we separate where the AI learns from where the data is for? So that's what my thesis is about. It's got a federated data model because I have to do it because I served the data center industry. And you can't take their data away. They have to sit at that data center. But I can't scale that way. I can't go put my AI model every day to center that we go do. So I'm like, okay. How can I do the inferencing over here? And let the data beware of the data is going to be. So it was really kind of that. That I think it solved not just our problem, but a lot of people's problems, right? As we, especially in real estate, as we move forward. The data sets are going to be at a different location. And how do we solve the security issues? The latency is all the other things that we need to do so the data can stay where the data is. And the AI can learn somewhere else. That's fantastic. Thanks. All right. Howard. Thanks for the introduction. We didn't let you literally get one word in.
