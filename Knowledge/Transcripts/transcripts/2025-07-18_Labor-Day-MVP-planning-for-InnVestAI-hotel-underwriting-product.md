### Guest (2025-07-18T20:03:11.390Z)

What we were looking at what we were looking at yesterday.

### You (2025-07-18T20:03:17.830Z)

Kinda slow today. Kinda really slow today. I know what's going on. I can try to find it. Yeah. No. I've got it coming up right now.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:03:40.410Z)

I can try to find it. One second.

### You (2025-07-18T20:03:47.370Z)

I've got too many windows open. That's my daily life. Like, I get loaded and my neighbors all things I believe.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:03:55.260Z)

That's my daily life.

### You (2025-07-18T20:03:56.080Z)

Even if

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:00.230Z)

Anyway, all the things they have.

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:00.450Z)

using AI, it can essentially gather almost all of the same information as CoStar on a market.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:07.810Z)

In post today that someone did

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:09.620Z)

Yeah. Really?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:10.930Z)

that using AI, they can essentially gather

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:11.840Z)

Yes. I know. Well, I I don't know if it's BS or not.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:15.130Z)

all the same information as CoStar on a market.

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:15.480Z)

But it would definitely I only have, like, four or 5,000 views on LinkedIn today.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:19.350Z)

Really? Yes. Yes. I know. Well, I I don't know if it's

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:24.350Z)

Broadly applicable that is.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:25.870Z)

BS or not. It was definitely it probably had, like, four, 5,000 views on LinkedIn today.

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:28.170Z)

Yeah. It was it was very much like the query I put together on

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:32.450Z)

Wow.

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:33.140Z)

Genspark. It went to all the different sources.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:34.810Z)

I wonder how broadly applicable that is. We're like, it was it the quantitative or just I think quantitative. Some some qualitative, some quantitative.

### You (2025-07-18T20:04:50.070Z)

Alright. Now we should be able to see it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:04:54.130Z)

That's that's impressive.

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:02.830Z)

Is it visible? It's all the tiny. Alright. Let me let tell me when it's okay. So tiny. Is it changing at all? No. Maybe it's a arm stick. There we go. Yeah. Yeah. I got I can't do it well.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:05:25.750Z)

Visible but tiny.

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:26.810Z)

Talking. But There we go. Yeah. It's just I I can see now. My computer's going so slowly that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:05:33.690Z)

Little tiny.

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:34.190Z)

don't let anyone tell you that MacBooks need more don't need more than eight. Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:05:38.210Z)

No. No. Maybe it's our

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:40.490Z)

I have to clear my cache all the time. So alright. So this

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:05:42.430Z)

There we go. There we go. Oh,

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:44.320Z)

this is what we reviewed yesterday. K.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:05:48.170Z)

there we go. We can see it. I I can see it now.

### You (2025-07-18T20:05:48.820Z)

And sort of I think if if I I'm gonna try to We'll talk about it. And then there's talking about which

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:08.390Z)

And the sort of

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:09.040Z)

I guess, should should find out. It should be something that is customer ready.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:12.700Z)

I think if I I'm gonna try to say this.

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:14.760Z)

And yeah,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:16.080Z)

What we talked about yesterday.

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:16.450Z)

that we have right now is the know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:18.610Z)

Because I think one of the at least

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:18.840Z)

we need something to move on. That

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:20.820Z)

question marks from from for me was, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:21.080Z)

that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:24.030Z)

there's the POC. Right? These things we're doing on mobile. And then there's we're talking about an MVP which

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:31.600Z)

now.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:31.740Z)

I guess, should should find out if it should be something that is customer ready.

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:31.960Z)

That to make it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:37.430Z)

And kind of gap we have right now is we you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:41.370Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:41.690Z)

we need something more robust than the than the lovable POC.

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:42.330Z)

the the zero receipt. Why

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:46.420Z)

To show mean, in some cases. Right? Some folks show might be you know, showing them the level the level of work that that

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:54.740Z)

this all the way out to what you think it would take to get the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:55.270Z)

is sufficient. But for others,

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:57.190Z)

to get to, like, a customer ready MVP. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:06:57.460Z)

we're gonna want something more robust But in order to do that, we're gonna need some money. Right? And so

### You (2025-07-18T20:06:59.620Z)

Yeah. So yeah. So know, this is definitely good visibility.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:04.470Z)

this is the the numbers here are really

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:05.000Z)

You know, not just for interest.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:07.160Z)

well, I think

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:07.420Z)

You know, a few weeks, but for the next couple of months.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:09.210Z)

gonna tell us what how much money we need

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:12.030Z)

And I think

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:12.440Z)

to start that work. And then

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:12.970Z)

how actually, more of a vaguely

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:15.460Z)

I mean, the the note and how are you guys kinda stretch this all the way out to what you think it would take to get the end

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:16.070Z)

this week,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:20.280Z)

to get to, like, a customer ready MVP. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:20.880Z)

thought that you guys were starting to set up meetings.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:23.700Z)

Yeah. So it's you know, this is this will give us good visibility, you know, not just for

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:28.620Z)

Friendly.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:29.720Z)

this first

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:30.260Z)

Find something more robust,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:31.280Z)

you know, few weeks, but for the next couple of months. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:31.690Z)

There will be you know, I know exactly what I'm but in the next six eight

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:35.690Z)

And I think Howard or excuse me. Yeah. Mark and Dan, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:36.860Z)

ten weeks. The work is denoted.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:39.310Z)

what we were talking about earlier this week,

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:39.510Z)

In our order to start We'll start to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:41.570Z)

You know, we it sounds like you guys are already starting to set up meetings, and we you're gonna use what we have with POC with Lovable to to to to do those.

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:48.100Z)

POC, start to use pieces of the MVP and things as they become available.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:52.590Z)

For anybody for which we want something more robust,

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:52.980Z)

To to show we wanna use that instead.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:55.800Z)

there will be you know, I don't know exactly when, but in the next

### You (2025-07-18T20:07:56.550Z)

Right? Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:07:59.890Z)

six, eight, ten weeks, the work that the node and Howard are gonna start will start to there there will be something for us to show for it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:06.820Z)

You know, more of, like, you expressed concern about people like something more robust. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:08.680Z)

Basically, right, that we can use as you know, instead of using the POC, we could start to use pieces of the MVP as they

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:10.980Z)

More polished. To show that that was that you know, some industry

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:15.900Z)

as they become available to to show

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:16.510Z)

you know, customers are coming So this kind of, I think, helps us get there.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:18.850Z)

if we want to use that instead. Right? Got it. It would it would be all it would be

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:21.680Z)

Okay. So so what specifically

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:24.530Z)

one a couple of months before we have something that we can actually turn over to a customer.

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:25.840Z)

is the cost over the next sixty days and and what what are we getting?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:29.500Z)

But Right. I think this helps us

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:30.120Z)

And what what will we pay. Alright. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:32.050Z)

You know, Mark, like, you expressed concern about if you wanted something more robust

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:34.940Z)

So the top section here are

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:36.360Z)

right, more polished to show to those that

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:37.000Z)

just the subscription tools that we're going to need at some point. Some of them, you can see we don't

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:40.600Z)

know, to some industry, you know, customers or companies. So this kind of, I think, helps us get there.

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:43.400Z)

need until later this year. Some of them, we do need

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:46.650Z)

Okay. So so what specifically

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:48.110Z)

right away. But these these are

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:51.010Z)

is the cost over the next

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:52.820Z)

literally nickel and dime items compared to some of the other items that we need. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:53.990Z)

sixty days and and what what are we getting? Where would we be?

### You (2025-07-18T20:08:57.250Z)

the big items down here fall into

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:08:58.560Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-18T20:09:00.150Z)

what Drew was just talking about. What is it gonna take for us to get from the POC to an MVP. And for December of twenty five? Yeah. Yeah. So basically, here's here's what we're looking at right now. So, Vinod, if you wanna go through any of the specifics, we can. Now rather than the discussion we had the other day. We were talking 90 get the And and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:09:38.400Z)

By December.

### You (2025-07-18T20:09:39.470Z)

it's gonna cost us less Like, we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:09:41.520Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T20:09:41.890Z)

exciting part of it. We're talking to someone, like, go find another 50 or 100,000 in sixty days or ninety days they

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:09:52.170Z)

But but that's not that's not the discussion we had the other day.

### You (2025-07-18T20:09:55.490Z)

get the MVP. I think

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:09:56.460Z)

I think the

### You (2025-07-18T20:09:58.340Z)

that is showing that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:00.510Z)

we were talking I think this gets us the the

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:01.220Z)

you know, the next six months, $12,000

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:03.940Z)

takeaway from this should be that

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:05.500Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:05.890Z)

it it it's gonna cost us less Like, we we because I think Mark and Anne, when we were talking, we thought we might eat know, like, $10,000 now. To get something more robust and then go find another

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:14.930Z)

have to be six months? Like, if if we threw a bunch of money at it now,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:18.170Z)

50 or 100,000 in sixty days or ninety days that would that would help us get to the MVP. I think what

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:18.850Z)

what could we get done in two months? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I don't think the time is our friend because, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:26.430Z)

this is showing is that

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:27.030Z)

people on this team

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:28.570Z)

in, you know, the next six months,

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:28.580Z)

are are actively talking to others about what we're doing.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:30.970Z)

$12,000

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:31.340Z)

And we're giving our ideas away.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:33.700Z)

you know, a little bit more than $12,000 could could be enough

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:34.230Z)

To lots of people industry And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:37.330Z)

or would be enough to get us to the MVP.

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:37.730Z)

you know, every month, don't have a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:39.720Z)

Yeah. But it's but I I guess my my point is that why does it have to be

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:40.680Z)

product we're running the risk of just

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:43.730Z)

months? Like, if if we threw a bunch of money at it now,

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:44.070Z)

building competition. So know, rather than looking at what we can do in

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:46.940Z)

what could we get done in two months?

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:47.950Z)

six months or nine months. You know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:49.380Z)

You know, I I don't think that I don't think that I don't think that time is our friend because

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:50.480Z)

if we said, you know, let's take the 10,000 and spend it in two months,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:54.470Z)

you know, people on this team are are actively talking to others about what

### You (2025-07-18T20:10:54.750Z)

wisely. Well, how much more could we do? Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:10:58.780Z)

we're doing. And we're giving our ideas away to lots of people in the industry.

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:04.550Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:04.820Z)

And, you know, every month that we don't have a

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:05.110Z)

Alright. So so I just stick to that. We make We just said,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:08.400Z)

product,

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:08.790Z)

for the next eight weeks

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:10.400Z)

we're running the risk of just

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:11.470Z)

Right? I mean, they almost

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:12.220Z)

building competition. So

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:12.960Z)

of people are asleep. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:13.920Z)

you know, rather than look at what we can do in six months or nine months,

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:14.360Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:18.080Z)

you know, if if we said, you know, let's take the 10,000 and spend it in two months wisely, Well, how much more could we do?

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:24.050Z)

What what can we do? Well, I'm I'm I'm going to let Vinod talk to that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:26.700Z)

Yep. That's fair. And then if that And then I know But but that was, I mean, that was the discussion we had

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:30.090Z)

Because what I'm what we're showing you here, these are actual

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:31.550Z)

the other day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so how do can we just stick to that? Like, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:34.220Z)

rates that that this is gonna be our monthly cost for

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:36.360Z)

we just said, for the next eight weeks,

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:39.490Z)

the app hosting and everything else. The only that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:40.190Z)

Right? I mean, you know, most people are asleep. Right? It's August It's July and August.

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:43.520Z)

costs on here that are variable

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:45.550Z)

We threw a bunch of money and we gave Howard and and Renaud a lot more

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:46.450Z)

would be this row here.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:49.040Z)

resources,

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:49.320Z)

Which is our offshore help. This is assuming

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:11:50.530Z)

you know, you know, more people what what could we do?

### You (2025-07-18T20:11:53.420Z)

two developers starting immediately would be you know, we'd have July and then August The note estimated $800 a month. For two developers. That's spoken to both of these guys, so they they have not working anywhere right now, so they can try they're they're capable. A born dental flannel. Them. One of my friends. Together.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:35.520Z)

And are these developers are these readily available, or is it gonna take us time to find people who we think are

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:38.690Z)

Works in under the branch IT company in

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:42.190Z)

capable?

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:42.480Z)

India. Okay. Great work.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:42.860Z)

I have already spoken to two of these guys, so they

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:44.620Z)

So we we brought those people on starting Monday just

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:47.110Z)

they I'm kind of not working anywhere right now, so they can join

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:48.650Z)

and we had to work for the next two months on

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:51.190Z)

say, from Monday.

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:52.040Z)

direction of the node.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:52.820Z)

Oh, that's great. And you know them, Vinod, and you think they're they're capable?

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:53.860Z)

And Howard now much more. Could we accomplish?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:56.190Z)

Yeah. I know them both of them. So one of

### You (2025-07-18T20:12:57.810Z)

You know, in

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:12:59.570Z)

them works for worked for one of my friends

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:02.880Z)

completing

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:03.560Z)

to develop his application. So similar tech stack. Another one works

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:06.600Z)

and then some of the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:08.530Z)

in another friend's IT company in India.

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:08.600Z)

API. Features. Probably. To be worse.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:12.190Z)

Okay. Great. So so if if we brought those people on starting Monday, just hypothetically, and we we had them work for the next two months under the direction of the node and Howard. Like, how much more could we accomplish?

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:25.590Z)

So okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:27.200Z)

And

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:28.210Z)

Yeah. And and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:30.220Z)

And, certainly, we are targeting completing, AVM

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:32.220Z)

$1,600? Again, I'm just trying to understand

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:34.380Z)

and the POC we are

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:34.790Z)

how we can scale this

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:35.980Z)

and then some of the AI

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:36.760Z)

in more efficiently.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:38.680Z)

features probably in

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:38.860Z)

So that we can can try to avoid

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:41.070Z)

three months. How many hours Vinod, how many hours of work do you expect

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:44.430Z)

So I can get one I can try to go

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:47.570Z)

Like, does does this, you know, four does $800 a month get?

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:48.080Z)

buy one more senior resource. These two guys are

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:51.100Z)

I mean, they are going to be available full time.

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:52.650Z)

one has two years of experience, another has

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:55.290Z)

Oh, okay. It is full time. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:55.670Z)

probably to close to two.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:57.080Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:13:58.290Z)

They are getting pretty very good.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:13:58.450Z)

And and and do we need to spend more? Like like, what about if we spent

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:00.060Z)

But I can just choose to try to find more senior resource, and then that way we can

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:01.940Z)

1,600 a month? Again, I'm just trying to understand how we can scale this

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:04.940Z)

probably scale

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:06.570Z)

you know, more efficiently

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:06.720Z)

faster. I mean, I think that's a good idea.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:08.860Z)

so that we can try to avoid

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:10.530Z)

Yeah. I know. I think that's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:11.260Z)

needless competition.

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:11.750Z)

I agree. Yeah. Yeah. Mark, I just wanna clarify that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:14.440Z)

I can get one I can try to find one more senior resource. These two guys are

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:18.630Z)

we probably could have said that, you know, this is the point.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:22.170Z)

one has two years of experience, another has

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:22.500Z)

Say, September. Where we expect to have

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:25.550Z)

close to two. But they are definitely very good,

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:26.840Z)

the MVP. Ready. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:30.040Z)

I can still try to find more senior resource, and that that way we could

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:30.670Z)

By having this spread out through December, I wasn't trying to imply that that's how much time we needed to get to an MVP by December. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:34.940Z)

probably scale faster. I mean, does everyone think that's a good idea? Yeah. I know. I

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:39.590Z)

These are basically our fixed monthly costs.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:14:41.170Z)

I think that's a I agree. It's a very good idea.

### You (2025-07-18T20:14:42.960Z)

Of subscriptions, everything else. The only thing that's variable, like I said, is would be the labor. So rather than getting you know, something and I'm I'm just hypothetically saying at the September, if we can bring on more, you know, potentially, could get it at the September, the August. So, yeah, I just wanna make sure that we weren't thinking that by having this monthly breakout, meant that we weren't gonna have the MVP until December. Right? Okay. Okay. That's good. Would resources and more programmers. Yeah. So the the Theoretically.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:15:48.760Z)

Got it. Okay. But that but that's that's it's great. Even better that the faster we work, you know, the lower the

### You (2025-07-18T20:15:52.460Z)

Complete that. Yeah. Right? Say Yeah. And as you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:15:54.640Z)

the the more benefit, I guess, we get out of these monthly subscriptions. So they're cost effective. And, also, not only getting MVP, but could the MVP include more stuff? If we had more financial resources and more

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:04.370Z)

I would my problem.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:07.710Z)

programmers. Right? So the could the MVP be better

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:10.820Z)

A really good

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:11.510Z)

than what we're contemplating with more

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:12.100Z)

like, cut off thing to say, what can we get done by Labor Day?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:14.180Z)

you know, human capital. Yeah. We should definitely

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:17.460Z)

Because literally, it just feels like the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:18.730Z)

keep our, you know, product backlog ready just in case we are able to

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:19.180Z)

capital markets community turns back on after Labor Day.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:23.620Z)

earlier. I'd say,

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:23.660Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:25.140Z)

assuming two months, maybe we are able to complete in one and a half month. And we should have

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:25.450Z)

until the second in December. I really

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:29.540Z)

more features available so that, you know, these guys can

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:29.720Z)

the September. Right? That's what I wanna point out. It's all like, really

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:32.720Z)

take those and, you know Yeah. So that would be that would be my vote.

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:33.090Z)

six weeks from where we are right now.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:36.560Z)

I mean, just just to try it's an arbitrary date, but Labor Day just feels like a really good like, cutoff point to say, what can we get done by Labor Day? Because, literally, it just

### You (2025-07-18T20:16:47.250Z)

To to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:16:49.830Z)

feels like the capital markets community turns back on after Labor Day. And everything goes until the second week in December. So I realize that's not the September. I that's what I wanted to point out. It's only really six weeks from where we are right now. Fifty sixty days ish?

### You (2025-07-18T20:17:09.130Z)

you know, share. To work. Next week on Monday. Right. But to go find out a clear

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:17:12.700Z)

Yeah. Yeah. For MVP, I would say with two two resources I thought, between two or three months and just, you know, margin in between just in case we run into some technical issues. With three resources, I'm more confident that we could probably do it within months. Well, it sounds like then, yeah, trying to find a third resource and we can start getting the other two to work next week. On Monday. Right. But but do we also have a clear I mean, I'm I'm sure you guys do. I don't. A clear understanding of what like, our goals are. Like, what will the product they give if we double staffing, you know, what what what can we reasonably expect to have by Labor Day? Yeah. I mean,

### You (2025-07-18T20:18:00.930Z)

Yeah. I was gonna say, Drew, you sent out an email that was pretty concise on on what was expected.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:18:04.080Z)

AVM, for sure,

### You (2025-07-18T20:18:06.180Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:18:06.220Z)

login complete database, the data extraction capabilities,

### You (2025-07-18T20:18:08.160Z)

So we're

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:18:11.730Z)

If we want to include document management, we'll have that. Some AI features, like, you know, whatever we have decided

### You (2025-07-18T20:18:15.690Z)

deal.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:18:17.920Z)

three features. Right? The whole So where where are we on the what what what is the what are the initial features that we are contemplating? Yeah. I think we have a recording. We talked about the yesterday as well. So they were really, like, based on my email that I sent. Yeah. So sort of four things. So the system should be able to generate a summary of a deal right, like, you've done underwriting and selected your comps and done all this stuff. You should be able to click a button, and it will give you a summary either

### You (2025-07-18T20:18:54.130Z)

Know, you

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:18:57.650Z)

in PDF or something that you could, like, copy it in into an email to send out to somebody. Including all the deal terms and findings and metrics and all that. That would be one. The another would be using AI to generate, like, do market research, essentially. Essentially. So you select your hotel, tell it, you know, what market you're looking at and say, you know, give me all the, you know, market overview, and use AI to you know, do all the you know, that kind of that kind of initial research that that analysts often do to figure out, you know, what are the competitive hotels, what's going on in the market, what's in the area, what are the demand generators. Right? Like, use AI to to to produce all of that.

### You (2025-07-18T20:19:31.500Z)

the yeah, documents. Right? So the contract.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:19:35.730Z)

With a click of a button. That's two. Three would be scraping financial data from the p and l's. Right? So something where

### You (2025-07-18T20:19:43.680Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:19:45.320Z)

know, you're you're downloading P and Ls from from a a data room or getting them from a broker or getting them from a seller. You drop them into

### You (2025-07-18T20:19:49.200Z)

save yourself how to read Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:19:52.790Z)

the, you know, the upload section of the portal.

### You (2025-07-18T20:19:53.310Z)

Those are the Yeah. That's That's great.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:19:56.110Z)

And it'll start scraping the summary p and l information and populating the historical

### You (2025-07-18T20:19:57.220Z)

Is there a young that could be interesting? And I know if this is AI or just

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:00.810Z)

That's three.

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:01.180Z)

some kind of data type, but just

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:02.440Z)

And then the third would be

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:02.540Z)

you know, analyzing you know, future supply in the market.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:04.660Z)

getting, like, the nonfinancial documents. Right? So the

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:05.770Z)

Is that something that could be done? Is there

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:09.030Z)

contracts, agreements, licenses, permits,

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:10.700Z)

a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:12.590Z)

all this stuff that comes in as part of the deal. So using AI to

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:17.810Z)

Right? I mean, I guess,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:17.860Z)

organize all of that and and, like, abstract and summarize the documents.

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:19.910Z)

like, a this to be you're doing research on the market,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:22.450Z)

Right? So it's again, so you can save yourself that to read every single one get a head start on it with that.

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:23.120Z)

You know, the huge rate, you know, between, like, whatever those websites are deal you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:29.080Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:29.630Z)

deal.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:29.860Z)

Those are the four things. Yeah. That's great. Is there another thing could that could be interesting And I don't know if this is AI or just

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:36.710Z)

Supply. Right? So we are the new

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:37.630Z)

some kind of database, but just, you know, analyzing, you know, future supply in a market.

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:39.220Z)

At least it's getting signed their tenants move to the market. Now their

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:42.520Z)

Is that something that could be done?

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:43.050Z)

you know, part of the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:44.140Z)

Future, like, prediction

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:44.270Z)

building's being demand being generated. And also, you know, is there

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:48.600Z)

of

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:49.790Z)

new supply

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:49.880Z)

It could it could probably

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:51.340Z)

in the pipeline, like, when there are other resources?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:52.730Z)

done as part of the market summary. Right? I mean, I guess, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:53.920Z)

About hotels being built or, you know, are there

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:20:56.000Z)

Mark, are you thinking, like, this this could be you're doing research on a market

### You (2025-07-18T20:20:57.100Z)

that could be you know, brought to the table officially with some kind of AI.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:00.550Z)

You know, there's usually, you know, with between, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:01.790Z)

Tool. Yeah. That would help you probably get

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:03.420Z)

whatever those websites are deal real real

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:04.380Z)

it. AI generation, like, market research.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:07.280Z)

There's you know, often websites that tell you what deals are under construction. Right? No. But there there's two aspects. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:08.200Z)

And also keep

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:12.250Z)

One is, like, demand supply. Right? So are the new leases getting signed or the tenants moving to the market? Are there, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:18.810Z)

you know, with So we the the But

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:20.790Z)

apartment buildings being built? You know, so so is there, you know, demand being generated and also also, you know, is there new supply in the pipeline? Like, was there are there recent articles about hotels being built? Or, you know, are there things of that nature that could be you know, brought to the table efficiently with some kind of AI tool? Yeah. I think that would all be part of the this AI generated, like, market research.

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:44.350Z)

just I I know not here for

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:44.410Z)

Okay. And we can also

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:46.240Z)

for a very long time that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:47.220Z)

use and maybe if we're getting close to the point where we wanna start try

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:47.750Z)

yeah, I can't imagine that riot would do something with us without talking to Dan.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:51.920Z)

start reaching out to Ryan at Lark. I know they're connected with, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:52.720Z)

Yeah. So maybe maybe we hit them at two levels. I mean, I might talk to Dan.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:56.660Z)

with

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:57.070Z)

You know, fairly often as we let you know that's sweet.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:21:57.190Z)

LW, so we need to be thoughtful about

### You (2025-07-18T20:21:59.640Z)

So if wanna do that, I think we'd be

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:00.260Z)

approaching Ryan. But they you know, like, as part of the forecast that his

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:04.500Z)

You know, maybe get to the two levels, maybe

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:05.770Z)

of the market forecast that that he puts together, they put together a lot. Yeah. They there's the the

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:06.610Z)

talk to Ryan, talk to Dan. Because, again,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:10.500Z)

pretty thick research

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:12.570Z)

we don't go ahead, they'll think we're, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:12.600Z)

papers to talk about events, demand generators. Yeah. No. I think that would be a great a great partnership. I mean, listen. I know I know you have a relationship

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:17.830Z)

I didn't talked about trying to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:20.600Z)

with Ryan, but just I I've known Dan Lesser for a very long time, and I can't imagine that Ryan would do something with us without talking to Dan. Yeah. I So Maybe maybe we hit them at two levels. I mean, I I talked to Dan you know, fairly often. I spoke to him actually earlier this week. So if if we wanna do that, and I think it would be a good idea to start that conversation,

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:38.130Z)

Yeah. I I mentioned this before, but I just wonder if there's a way to create an adventure with

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:42.490Z)

maybe we hit them at two levels. Maybe you talked to Ryan. I talked to Dan just

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:44.320Z)

Ryan and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:45.910Z)

you know, as a

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:45.990Z)

You know, it's almost like a paper performance so that every time

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:47.230Z)

because, again, ultimately, Dan's gonna be a viable decision anyway,

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:50.470Z)

they would join the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:50.490Z)

if we don't go to him, he'll think we're, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:51.350Z)

data, you know, they get they can pay for it, you know, much like a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:52.450Z)

trying to go around him, and that'll piss him off. And I talked to Ryan often, and we talked about

### You (2025-07-18T20:22:56.100Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:22:57.670Z)

trying to incorporate his data into our a plat

### You (2025-07-18T20:23:00.160Z)

A lot of it

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:23:00.610Z)

you know, hotel BIS, but it hasn't really been as applicable.

### You (2025-07-18T20:23:01.610Z)

that approach

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:23:03.670Z)

Because we do asset management. This is a acquisition, which is, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:23:04.930Z)

or

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:23:06.620Z)

a perfect application of I mean, of of his data in a more robust accessible interface where people are gonna get even more use out of it. You know? Yeah. And I've, you know, I I've mentioned this before, but I just wonder if there's a way to create some kind of venture with Ryan and or Dan Lesser where it's almost like a pay for performance so that every time know, we draw their data, you know, they get a they get paid for it, you know, much like a you know, Well, a lot of platforms work. A lot of the groups that that we would approach are, you know, already LARP customers. He gave me he sends me his his information every once in a while, so see. Most recently, he said his customers include

### You (2025-07-18T20:23:54.930Z)

just really happy about it. Have us have access to the rest they make. I think what that's that's part of what I'm talking with Ryan.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:23:58.850Z)

First Hospitality, KFL, Stockdale, Electra,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:01.570Z)

Totorelvia.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:02.880Z)

Park Hotels, Apple, Davidson, SonestAI,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:04.940Z)

Ryan. Think there's a way

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:05.900Z)

the Commonwealth, Noble, Host,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:06.270Z)

and here,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:08.110Z)

Hilton, Ashford, Remington, Braemar, KHP, Access Point, Wheelock,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:08.380Z)

way you describe it like, well, three parts

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:12.780Z)

Dauntless Capital, CIM, HEI, DiamondRock, Driftwood, Hyatt,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:15.490Z)

I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:17.250Z)

BPG, PM, Paige, McQuinney,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:17.420Z)

I don't need to charge it for for it. I just ability

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:20.480Z)

Concord That's an imprep comment. Who who who in the industry isn't on the list?

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:20.650Z)

to assist And can I just talk to her or something? Because one of the fairies big successes

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:24.580Z)

Maybe it's easier to do that one. Basically, like, they those groups are all already paying

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:27.160Z)

is that markup.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:29.550Z)

Mark. Right. But but just because they're they're just because they're paying doesn't mean that they

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:29.630Z)

Data. Like, right, I don't think that's one of our revenue

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:33.620Z)

necessarily have the ability to

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:33.780Z)

streams I'm trying to mark up

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:35.280Z)

have us have access to it. Right? They may

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:35.360Z)

data good

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:37.330Z)

I think what that's that's part of what I talked about with Ryan. We

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:38.410Z)

relationships. Data prior to just said. You're right. Like, you

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:40.840Z)

toyed around with the idea of how would the economics work, and he's like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:41.580Z)

we paid the 30 k. Three We're not saying it's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:43.800Z)

I think that the way he described it and he may have changed his stance on it, but

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:46.250Z)

35 k 35 k of it. Right? It's just lower

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:47.230Z)

way he described it is like, look. If somebody's already paying the the 30,000 or whatever it is to get the annual subscription for his platform, if they he's like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:50.300Z)

gonna need to be out there to help people people and we're having reseller. Of data.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:54.410Z)

I don't need to he didn't feel the need to charge anymore for it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:24:55.300Z)

And that's the second point I wanted to to talk about is because this is just something I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:24:58.240Z)

If it's available in our system. And can I just jump in here for a second? Because one of

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:00.810Z)

believe someone who's done so much underwriting. It's one thing

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:03.720Z)

Cherry's big successes is that they don't actually mark up

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:04.250Z)

go and ask your boss for $30,000 a year. It's another thing to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:08.460Z)

data. Like right? I don't think that's one of our

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:08.630Z)

be under the gun. Deal. And say, oh,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:11.990Z)

revenue streams should be trying to mark up

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:12.520Z)

this thing is for $199.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:14.290Z)

data because we want

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:14.980Z)

I'll just, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:16.320Z)

good relationships with data providers. So just like you said, Drew. Right? Like, if they pay the

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:20.050Z)

some deal call. This is,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:21.290Z)

30 k,

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:21.720Z)

sense? So, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:22.650Z)

great. We're not paying we're not saying it's 35 k and keeping 5 k up

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:23.080Z)

I think they're pressure thigh and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:27.470Z)

it. Right? It's just we're bringing the data together to help people

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:27.580Z)

smaller increments, could really help their sales. That's just my that's just my opinion because

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:31.970Z)

we're not a reseller of data. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:34.350Z)

never been successful

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:34.590Z)

And then the second point I wanted to talk about is

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:35.520Z)

in getting a company to go buy

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:37.700Z)

because this is just something I believe as someone who's done so much underwriting.

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:38.100Z)

subscription like them. They're always like, oh, we know so and so, and we can show us what our

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:42.670Z)

It's one thing to go in and ask your boss for $30,000 a year,

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:43.320Z)

connections and get for free. Does that make sense? But if Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:46.890Z)

It's another thing to be under the gun

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:47.220Z)

Yeah. I thought

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:49.390Z)

underwriting a deal and say, oh, this is

### You (2025-07-18T20:25:50.500Z)

You know? I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:25:52.950Z)

$199. I'll just, like, put this on my, you know, like, corporate credit card and reimburse it as deal it's sunk deal cost. Does this make sense? So, like, I think, like, they're the pressure to buy in smaller increments could really help their sales. That's just my that's just my opinion. Because

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:13.020Z)

research.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:14.470Z)

I've never been successful in getting a company to go buy a subscription like that. They're always like, oh, we know so and so, and we can just work our connections and get it for free. Does that make sense? But Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:27.590Z)

Drew, I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:27.750Z)

Yeah. That's how I've been done.

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:28.130Z)

I I just know

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:29.650Z)

Benchmarker. I agree. Like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:29.790Z)

guys, I don't want to think it's just a pre, but I think we're amazing.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:31.320Z)

one is Lauren and Brian is okay with it, I think if his if his stance hasn't changed, right, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:36.440Z)

Discussions as soon as possible because I think that could be another

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:38.720Z)

any of these groups that I just mentioned, and there's a few more including, like, Highgate, Rockbridge, and Audia,

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:39.190Z)

you know, great resource for us

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:43.390Z)

they would all be, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:44.050Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:44.940Z)

I mean, a, maybe if if we're part kind of unofficially or informally partnering with Lark to use their market data, as sort of the basis for our forecast and market research.

### You (2025-07-18T20:26:52.440Z)

Don't

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:26:55.680Z)

Or to assist with, you know, the market research and the and the forecast. Then, like, any of these groups, we could go to them and be like, look. This is a an even better way to utilize the Lark subscription you're already paying for. Right? Like, it's gonna be Yeah. Listen. I I I hope you're right. I mean, Drew, I I just knowing Dan and those guys, I I don't know if they give it to us for free, but I it would be amazing if they did. I do think that we should have those discussions as soon as possible because I think that could be another

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:19.800Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:21.620Z)

you know, great resource for us.

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:22.480Z)

File.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:23.910Z)

Alright. Well, I'll reach out to Ryan on Monday. Alright. If you want me to if you want me to reach out to Dan, let me know. I won't do it until I hear back from you.

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:28.570Z)

If if it has to get more robust, then then I think that would be, like, an API that he would

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:31.130Z)

Yeah. Let's let me go because I mean, obviously,

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:33.610Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:33.970Z)

Ryan runs things through Dan, but, you know, he and have been talking so often. And I've I've

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:36.240Z)

query data via the API. That sounds great.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:39.180Z)

last I was in New York, I got drinks with

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:39.710Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:40.850Z)

Dan and Evan and and Ryan. So Okay. Great. This this could be something that just doesn't even need to be

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:44.450Z)

Terrific. Cool.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:46.200Z)

surfaced. Right? Because it's been talked about so many times before.

### You (2025-07-18T20:27:46.780Z)

So so now I need to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:27:48.680Z)

Hopefully, doesn't cost anything at anybody anything extra. So could we I mean, could we do kind of API connection and just pull their data into our system? I mean, that would be amazing. I mean, right now, it would what we were talking about was, like, just sort of, like, Excel. It you know, every quarter, he'd send the updated files that we can put into our data model. It'd just be like a an f like a

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:07.020Z)

and it goes with me.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:08.900Z)

a file load. But this if if it as it gets more robust, then this I think, yeah, it would be like an API that he would set up you know, configure his database, and we could we could query data via an API.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:17.810Z)

We checked them up to this page. Although we can

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:20.720Z)

That that would be great.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:21.190Z)

So, you know, probably go over.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:22.560Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:23.300Z)

In the POC.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:23.450Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:24.520Z)

We have to start the project

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:27.380Z)

Terrific. Cool. So so it sounds like okay. So I'll reach out to Ryan on Monday. And, Vinod, you're gonna talk with your the two developers you've already been talking with

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:41.260Z)

to all of us and probably email

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:41.710Z)

and try to find a third.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:43.840Z)

as well. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:44.030Z)

And we'll start start to get to work on Monday.

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:44.870Z)

pretty coward. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:48.660Z)

I think those are the main and I I those are the main things. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:48.960Z)

For for that. Just, like, a little number of the the full, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:52.480Z)

Who who will oversee these developers, Benoit? Would that be your

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:54.470Z)

spot. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:55.310Z)

that'll be your thing?

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:55.540Z)

in the learning.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:28:57.510Z)

Yeah. So I'll kind of groom them and get them up

### You (2025-07-18T20:28:58.160Z)

Even if we could just get a pending error.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:02.000Z)

over the weekend, you know, probably go over

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:02.410Z)

Perfect. Also, have that personal email. But for company

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:06.760Z)

the POC and that tech style and probably you know, get them up to the speed. You know, they go ahead. Sorry. Finish. No. The Right? We'd probably require two more Teams account for them to be connected to all of us and probably email as well. So, probably Howard is looking into that. They don't need to be what what level of licenses for for that? Just like a low level or they need the full, like, v five license?

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:39.110Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:39.210Z)

No. And any low level should be good even if we could just get Teams.

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:40.100Z)

Yeah. Let me look into it because we do have the office

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:44.590Z)

Their reception. Email

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:44.860Z)

365. Guess so.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:46.250Z)

but we can also use their personal email. But

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:46.670Z)

Something to write back. So we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:50.210Z)

for company gating, I think we can Microsoft like, the Microsoft the basic license is, like, $10 a month.

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:50.720Z)

we need to look and see. I think there's one unused c in our current subscription.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:29:56.000Z)

If you add in Office three sixty five access and all that, then it's more like a 110 or a 115.

### You (2025-07-18T20:29:58.990Z)

So we'd probably have to do a couple more, but it'll be just like when we first set it up between us. The

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:01.980Z)

So obviously, we should get the lowest level license we need. Yeah. But if they already have access to

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:05.600Z)

I think we all reimbursed Diane for

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:07.130Z)

to Office three sixty five, like, if they if they use micros if they use, like, Excel and and stuff, like, personally,

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:10.730Z)

a year of the email. I think it was Drew, like what you said, it was roughly

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:13.460Z)

then then we can just get they can use their personal Excel and personal

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:15.750Z)

$10 a month.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:16.940Z)

Office three sixty five, and we can just get them the low level license for, like, $10.

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:17.880Z)

For all those. And with that, that's how we have teams. And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:20.790Z)

$10 will include Teams. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:22.610Z)

Excel

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:23.090Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:24.390Z)

If you log in to Excel or Word using your

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:27.180Z)

Hey, guys. I'll be right back.

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:27.410Z)

InnVestAI, you you'll see the Copilot there. So we do have pretty much all of that information.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:30:31.470Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T20:30:42.870Z)

Actually Yeah. My screen. Right? Yeah. I I Like, what's Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:19.540Z)

We should what I'm saying is I think we should be careful not to

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:23.020Z)

We will. We'll we'll get the minimum, but we'll we'll have to take a look and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:26.600Z)

because, like, I I'm actually guilty of this myself. I have a personal Office three sixty five that I pay a $100 a year $150 a year for. And then I also have

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:27.630Z)

see what we have and and if there's any possibility of adding at least, you know, one more to it. So Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:35.880Z)

a work Office three sixty five, which they're due I don't need

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:37.030Z)

Okay. Actually and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:40.040Z)

really don't need both of them. I I do have them. And then for any additional licenses I'm showing you on my screen. Right? Like, I have I only have like, most of the

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:48.400Z)

I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:51.290Z)

licenses that I get are these business basic licenses, which are, like, $10.

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:51.380Z)

to start

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:55.230Z)

The the one that has, like, all the different stuff in it

### You (2025-07-18T20:31:55.260Z)

with. We can start

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:31:58.330Z)

these e five like, these are, like, a 120 or a $130 a month. We should just be sure we're getting the cheapest license that we need Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-07-18T20:32:20.040Z)

five, so probably pick them. For

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:32:22.030Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-07-18T20:32:22.170Z)

four weeks. Minus.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:32:23.560Z)

I think that that should be And then the other thing is I need the car too. Get started. To put on Azure. And I can I can you one of my you you can use one of my cards? To start. Okay. Cool. And we can start working on a bank account as well. Yeah. That is the other thing.

### You (2025-07-18T20:32:47.420Z)

Required. A bank.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:32:48.610Z)

By the end of this month, we'll have to pay these guys. Right? So Do do we do we pay them how do we pay them? Probably, we can pay them once a month.

### You (2025-07-18T20:32:48.780Z)

Phone. So probably we can use something like that. I don't think I would How do we do we all do all five of us need to account? How does something like that work? So So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:02.810Z)

But since this month ends on thirty first, so probably we could pay them for

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:02.930Z)

you know, like, I said it up. I'm the admin and then I added

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:07.670Z)

two weeks minus one day. It's not it's not they we're not gonna pay them with a credit card. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:09.070Z)

anybody to it that I just asked. And they get their own login

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:12.250Z)

They are they gonna send an invoice like a contractor and we pay them that way?

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:14.840Z)

Nitro, sync

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:15.960Z)

Or Venmo? Or And so

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:17.000Z)

any extra don't

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:20.360Z)

I transfer money using a There's a app called Remitly that I use to transfer US dollar into Indian rupees, Indian currency. But that does require a bank account.

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:33.420Z)

Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:34.820Z)

So probably

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:37.340Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:37.540Z)

we can use something like that. I don't think credit card would

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:38.530Z)

Every get I'll take it

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:40.610Z)

do. How do we do we all do all five of us need to be on a bank

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:41.840Z)

deposit. So we never want it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:44.050Z)

account? How does something like that work? So the way it works for our bank, Novo, is it's like, I set it up. I'm the admin, and then I added anybody to it that I needed to add. And they get their own login

### You (2025-07-18T20:33:59.510Z)

Eight.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:33:59.840Z)

And I don't think it costs any extra. Think you could get, you know, a couple you know, at least two, you know, logins without any additional cost.

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:06.750Z)

Company account. So we can do that. What it well.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:10.410Z)

We probably all don't need access. I mean, it could be

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:11.640Z)

I think I see I have a card

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:14.080Z)

know, I mean, maybe if he doesn't need all

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:16.630Z)

think I have a card. I can get

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:17.840Z)

don't know. But we'll see. It it was Okay. Novo is very, very easy. Okay. So I think it's a good one to start with. We can I can deposit some initial money in there and get and get Mark set up so we can deposit these as well?

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:31.650Z)

really actually. Sounds good. K.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:33.060Z)

And for credit card, I don't I

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:35.790Z)

Yeah, that's all I need.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:38.030Z)

for my company, I never got a company credit card. I just use a personal card.

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:38.420Z)

Looking forward to get started.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:41.920Z)

And I just keep my that card is just set aside for these my company expenses. So

### You (2025-07-18T20:34:49.480Z)

Do things?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:34:50.660Z)

and it's and it's paid from the company account. So we can do that. This way as well. I think I still have to go see if I have a card I probably I I think I have a card that I can use that just I'll link it to the company account, to get paid, and we can charge anything we need to it. And then for these guys, paying them, it's not like it needs to be a bank payment. So we can set up remit yeah. I can do all I can set up all this. Early next week. Sounds good. Yeah. And that's all I need. I'm really looking forward to get it started.

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:25.320Z)

Without much planning. To always pretty standard. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:28.290Z)

Holding back for some time.

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:28.940Z)

can get a start. From there.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:29.790Z)

Alright. And, you know, just I wanted to ask, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:31.970Z)

I have UI. With your home.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:33.110Z)

what is the order in which you do things

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:36.030Z)

Like, extraction and the background

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:36.470Z)

Like, right. Or is it or is it

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:38.240Z)

have to continue working on infrastructure development.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:39.000Z)

it's I mean, I'm I'm sure it's like there's a lot of overlap, but it's it's like, are you gonna start working on the interface? Like, the that

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:44.300Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:45.580Z)

what we've been looking at in Movable. Right? Like, that interface, is that

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:47.290Z)

things we can work on of the computer.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:49.410Z)

gonna be

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:49.720Z)

As well as

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:50.490Z)

sooner or or do you work on the data model first?

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:53.670Z)

core problem. They do the computer to our app servers.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:35:54.340Z)

Or the you know, what I guess, like, what do you do you know, what covers the order of things?

### You (2025-07-18T20:35:57.360Z)

So, yeah, I'm talking then.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:00.990Z)

Yeah. That is a good question. So probably the login part first because there's not much UI. And we can get it started without much planning. So login is pretty standard.

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:10.110Z)

Think probably we can work on that one. Then. Upload, document extraction.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:14.140Z)

Right? So we can get it started from there.

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:16.370Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:16.490Z)

And then, yeah, UI for sure.

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:17.490Z)

you know, as we have

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:19.760Z)

Then probably object

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:20.500Z)

in the So since

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:22.180Z)

data extraction. In the background, we have to continue working on infrastructure development.

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:24.300Z)

you know, kind of separate

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:28.120Z)

Otherwise, we'll not have access to the servers. So in these things, we can work on local computer. And as soon as our infrastructure is ready, we can kind of deploy the code from

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:38.030Z)

I really want I I I have PTSD.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:41.170Z)

local computer to our servers. So I have to log in then the basic UI wherein the user will land after login page. And I'm hoping by the time our

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:53.560Z)

What

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:54.580Z)

infrastructure would be ready, so

### You (2025-07-18T20:36:54.930Z)

we were doing or what we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:36:56.450Z)

then probably we can work on document dates document upload document extraction. And then, you know, once we have

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:03.240Z)

it's my I don't wanna do that. Yet.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:05.020Z)

data in place and they will part,

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:07.040Z)

Change, using it and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:08.480Z)

So since, you know, we will be working with

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:08.560Z)

building on top of it. So I really bring, using

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:12.490Z)

of separate

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:12.760Z)

we have it. Very like, all the different

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:15.610Z)

work with I'll I'll intro to it. You know, I'll keep you posted.

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:16.480Z)

different attributes. Of the data. Like, the first

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:20.580Z)

How we are planning. But that's We only it That's I just really I

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:22.730Z)

So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:24.560Z)

I really wanna let I I I'm have PTSD from mistakes made on our data model. Early on.

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:34.260Z)

And why.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:34.940Z)

And I just

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:35.120Z)

And then we can, you know, this test anything.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:36.080Z)

you know, because

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:37.230Z)

Better approach.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:37.480Z)

I did not clearly articulate

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:38.200Z)

Okay. Yeah. And location

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:40.190Z)

what what we were doing or what needed to be in the data model or how it needed to be configured.

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:41.760Z)

are for straightforward. Right? Like, listing operating units and attributes.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:46.440Z)

And, and it's

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:48.370Z)

Well, I could actually

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:49.640Z)

and so I just I don't wanna do that again because I I know it's hard to change once you start

### You (2025-07-18T20:37:49.860Z)

I should say that. I think

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:37:53.870Z)

using it and building on top of it. So I really, really, wanna make that we have it very clearly like, all the dimensions and attributes of the data model very, know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:04.660Z)

well. And then there's, yeah, the entire hierarchy, and then there's also version, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:05.520Z)

we really talk about that and make sure it's correct. Definitely. Yeah. So when our

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:09.300Z)

budget forecast, capsules, pro form a. Right? Different

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:10.850Z)

we are designing the database, I'll update to how it is being designed.

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:14.220Z)

also, you have the different versions of So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:16.960Z)

You know. Yeah. What is going to be stored

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:17.330Z)

to make sure you have all that really captured. Sure. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:19.910Z)

where and why

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:20.840Z)

something called Sky's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:21.630Z)

and then we can, you know, discuss if there's any better approach.

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:22.790Z)

how that voice is fact

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:24.700Z)

Okay. Yeah. And it's I mean, the

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:24.960Z)

facts in one day, and then there are other domain.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:26.810Z)

the location tables are pretty straightforward. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:28.850Z)

So that's probably what I'm

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:30.280Z)

listing operating units and attributes.

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:30.680Z)

going on. With you.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:33.920Z)

Well, I should actually, I shouldn't say that.

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:37.150Z)

The actual diagram.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:37.280Z)

There we last time we talked about this a long time ago, there there were some

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:38.670Z)

We can decide you know. Yeah. Having that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:41.520Z)

we talked about using a parent child, like, two levels of the location table.

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:42.120Z)

Yeah. I start seeing it as well, Kyle. Know anything about this specific

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:46.320Z)

If this rings a bell,

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:47.980Z)

fee on that. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:49.400Z)

And then

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:50.970Z)

Well, what we can talk about now, what's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:51.260Z)

Mhmm. And then there's, yeah, the account hierarchy, and then there's also version like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:53.050Z)

it gets you know, once you do that, starts to get.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:55.900Z)

budget

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:56.300Z)

Closer working on it. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:38:57.400Z)

forecast actuals pro form a. Right? A different

### You (2025-07-18T20:38:58.450Z)

I would

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:00.460Z)

all financial data for different versions of it. So

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:00.530Z)

started to, like, describe that things, log in. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:03.910Z)

make sure we have all that clearly captured.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:04.740Z)

Well, Vinod, remember, as part of the authentication, we are gonna have to have an account user

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:05.810Z)

Sure. So there's something called star schema. So how that works is

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:09.560Z)

hierarchy.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:10.450Z)

the fact facts in one table, and then there are other dimension tables.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:10.900Z)

And figure out how we're gonna do that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:14.740Z)

So that's

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:15.610Z)

We spoke about that earlier this week.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:16.440Z)

what I'm gonna use.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:17.630Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:18.570Z)

And, you know, as

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:20.380Z)

Including having a user who could potentially be a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:21.430Z)

just kind of create the architectural diagram. We can decide before, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:24.720Z)

associated with more than one account.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:27.000Z)

going that route.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:27.190Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:28.810Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:29.900Z)

this has all been a very good conversation, but I'm gonna ask that we take it back

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:29.960Z)

I think we use the star schema well, but I don't know anything about the specifics beyond that.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:34.630Z)

where we were before Mark dropped

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:35.880Z)

Okay. Well, well, we can talk about that once it it gets

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:37.760Z)

If we are increasing the headcount

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:40.660Z)

you know, once you start to get closer to working on it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:41.280Z)

for the engineering team, I wanna make it clear

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:43.960Z)

Yeah. Will good. Yes.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:45.650Z)

that the advantage is to get to the MVP

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:46.320Z)

Get to start to, like, standard things, log in probably.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:49.710Z)

sooner.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:39:50.400Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-18T20:39:50.620Z)

Not to add more features to it. We need to draw a line in the sand that the items that were outlined in drew's email are what we expect to include in the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:40:02.270Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-18T20:40:04.470Z)

The reason for an MVP is to get it in front of potential users. Let them try it. Let them tell us what they like and what they don't like. And it it's pretty much an assumption that no matter what you do in software, something's either gonna break or users are not gonna like it. We may think it's the best thing since sliced bread, but a user getting in there and inputting data may think it sucks. So there's no reason getting too, no advantage whatsoever. Of getting too far ahead of ourselves. In adding more and more features until we've been able to vet what the core product is and the existing features we have there. Now that being said, the huge advantage of having more head count is that we will be able to start adding those additional features at a fast rate than what we could be or could have had before. So again, it come it boils down to selecting who our MVP clients are. It's not the time where we just open it up to anybody. We need to get in front of the people that you know that you trust, that can give us honest feedback in exchange for whatever we wanna do for them in terms of using the tool and use their feedback to make sure we're going the way the users want us not the way we think the right way to go. Better. Friends with peach Hotel Group. So just put that out there that Mark has relationships with the big senior level, you're relationships. I mean, I technology We have today. And just to summarize, shared a little bit about what we're doing. Keep said, that peach tree could be interesting. Fit for their down and structured

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:42:34.800Z)

This is a really good point for me to jump in and just I had and

### You (2025-07-18T20:42:35.390Z)

finance group to start a pilot. They would like to see it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:42:39.770Z)

I'm friends with well, Mark is

### You (2025-07-18T20:42:40.490Z)

Because somewhere. I mean, I guess, as a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:42:42.820Z)

better friends with

### You (2025-07-18T20:42:43.240Z)

BP benefits.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:42:45.050Z)

Peachtree Hotel Group. So let's just put that out there. That Mark has relationships at the very senior level.

### You (2025-07-18T20:42:50.360Z)

Information.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:42:52.290Z)

I have relationships at a lower level and we both know the but they're based in Atlanta. And I

### You (2025-07-18T20:42:59.080Z)

Also, like, bat solving and doing some things on it that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:02.270Z)

meet with I have lunch with Brian, like, once every six months.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:03.100Z)

structured finance side.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:05.290Z)

We connect, and he tells me his thoughts on technology. We had lunch today.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:05.620Z)

It's changed for the He said

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:09.940Z)

And just to summarize, I shared a little bit about what

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:11.240Z)

but he asked how long

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:14.250Z)

we're doing. He said that Peachtree could be interested in it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:18.880Z)

I told him told was fifty k. Because was using code numbers that we told them. Plus some for some for salary. Right? I'm thinking about six months.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:19.320Z)

He thinks it'd be the best fit for their debt and structured finance group to start a pilot. They would like to see it between somewhere I mean, I guess at an MVP, but at an MVP,

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:28.850Z)

Said no to nothing to them. And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:31.690Z)

where they can still add like, what they want. Because for them, market information gathering is really, really important.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:38.270Z)

feedback. Get to what the platform looks like.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:41.480Z)

And so that might be more important than other things that we're thinking about.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:42.050Z)

It might be something might Right? Be something consider.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:45.970Z)

They also like that idea of, like, back solving and doing some things on the debt and

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:46.570Z)

Either as a client or an investor or maybe a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:50.610Z)

finance side.

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:50.900Z)

client that's locked in and have lower

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:53.280Z)

In exchange for this,

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:53.510Z)

fees.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:43:55.250Z)

he said we didn't didn't really talk about it much, but he asked how long it

### You (2025-07-18T20:43:58.500Z)

Side.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:00.400Z)

like, he how long and how much it would cost for us to get to a true MVP.

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:02.140Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:05.440Z)

Told I just I told him a 150 k because

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:07.510Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:08.550Z)

I was using kind of numbers that we had talked about

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:09.130Z)

Peach tree. They don't like their

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:11.190Z)

plus some in front for some for salary. Right? And thinking about six months.

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:13.030Z)

systems, and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:15.740Z)

He said that's nothing to them. And that how this could help

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:19.180Z)

But then said

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:21.660Z)

their debt and structured finance team, especially if they can get in early and have feedback

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:22.130Z)

with an underwriting. Solution. So they're curious about that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:26.630Z)

into what the platform looks like. It might be something it might.

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:31.270Z)

Feel

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:31.570Z)

Right, be something they would consider either as a

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:32.720Z)

internal person has done a better job of how

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:34.890Z)

client or maybe an investor or maybe as a client that that gets locked

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:37.270Z)

how he can split people,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:39.860Z)

in at lower fees.

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:40.250Z)

interface. Like that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:42.080Z)

All the work they've done internally to date has been on the asset management side.

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:42.700Z)

Keep it from quickly. Time.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:46.600Z)

Michelle at Single Pain and the CHA Pneumatic guys, right, have both pitched

### You (2025-07-18T20:44:46.840Z)

Her like, how fast he's But he said shit. I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:44:56.440Z)

Peachtree They don't like their systems as much as they like what they've done in house already on the asset management side.

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:04.300Z)

was

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:07.080Z)

But they said no one has come to them with an underwriting.

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:10.270Z)

produce

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:11.030Z)

Solution. And so they're curious say what they didn't like about it just to get to learn

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:12.770Z)

Like, and how

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:16.000Z)

today? On the asset management side, they feel like their internal person has done a better job of how he organizes data, how he displays it to people, user user interface. And things like that. He did say he thought Michelle would catch up pretty quickly based on her

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:30.640Z)

a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:35.060Z)

rate of growth, like, how

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:36.730Z)

platform. So which which did did. I think that that that is what PedriA will be

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:36.940Z)

fast she's growing. But he said, at this point, she's not focused on underwriting.

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:40.620Z)

for. Right. So what is it entails is broad and go to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:43.740Z)

Yeah. And that's him to keep it very confidential that we're focused on underwriting. Go ahead, Drew. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:44.740Z)

talk to that house. And obviously, her would be involved. We

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:48.380Z)

Yeah. The the when I pitched Peachtree, what they were interested in was

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:50.800Z)

show that some product

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:53.100Z)

I mean, it was, right off the bat. They're like, show us what your system can can

### You (2025-07-18T20:45:53.990Z)

that is I'm guessing that pledge is called Day.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:45:57.910Z)

like, produce as far as, like, term metrics. Like, Mhmm. And I was like, we don't have that at all. But we do. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:04.300Z)

Structure. Finance piece of it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:06.660Z)

So That that that require the acquisition part.

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:07.190Z)

To get Peachtree more excited, but we don't wanna go too far because they have been in

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:09.790Z)

Upfront to know, like, what did you invest in the property? What's your loan terms? All that. Right? Like, we don't

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:12.060Z)

distinct ideas. But they are in market of information.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:14.750Z)

generally capture any information. We just tell you

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:16.850Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:17.420Z)

how are you performing to budget, to last year, or, you know, where the soft

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:18.330Z)

I think that's kinda positive. I mean, it we could

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:21.750Z)

performance, but it's not like a

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:22.360Z)

you know, this is where the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:23.290Z)

it's not an investment returns

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:25.130Z)

So I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:25.270Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:26.360Z)

pitched idea

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:26.990Z)

platforms, which which this is. I think that that that is what Petri is looking for.

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:27.640Z)

sign up at in Atlanta. But it won't be marks. To, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:31.800Z)

Right. So what it entails is

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:31.820Z)

work to be out of the he has the real

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:34.040Z)

Brian going to talk to their head of debt and structured finance, and, obviously, Greg would be involved.

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:34.350Z)

like, relationships with Peachtree. And we'll have to figure out the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:41.140Z)

We would show them some product that is I'm guessing the

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:45.190Z)

the correct return.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:47.720Z)

let's just call it the Labor Day product. Right? If we can get the Labor Day product, I mean, maybe we do need to

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:53.320Z)

And then there are now

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:53.660Z)

think a little bit more about the debt and structured financing piece

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:54.790Z)

debt to be a separate like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:46:58.300Z)

of it to get Peachtree more excited. But we don't wanna go too far

### You (2025-07-18T20:46:59.620Z)

those type of, you know, trade

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:03.060Z)

because they have very distinct ideas.

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:04.070Z)

pain. That it converts. With the debt structure finance person.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:06.080Z)

Information, and they love Lark.

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:09.310Z)

I set up

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:10.590Z)

So,

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:10.650Z)

today and I know that's higher than what we're talking about, but

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:12.200Z)

I think it's kinda positive. I mean, if if

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:13.810Z)

it was, like, hard

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:15.400Z)

we could now this is where this is where we

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:16.570Z)

south south. Alive for sick months.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:20.370Z)

So

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:20.570Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:21.160Z)

I pitched the idea because Brian and I are both in Atlanta, but this will be Mark's

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:21.940Z)

alive months. That even if he

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:26.130Z)

to, like, work through. He has the real he has the real relationship

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:27.700Z)

served. Year.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:30.350Z)

with Peachtree. And

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:30.580Z)

After debt and structured finance. Teams.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:33.260Z)

have to figure out what we wanna show them and when we wanna show it to them.

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:33.660Z)

Because it's an easier underwriting than And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:37.340Z)

Doesn't need to be perfect, but it will need to absolutely produce the correct

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:38.340Z)

talked about it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:42.100Z)

IRR and, you know, the the metrics and the returns and those things, we're gonna have to make sure we get those right.

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:47.280Z)

Right? Because it's just a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:48.950Z)

And that there are enough debt and metrics

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:49.060Z)

refi. It's it's like no big deal. It's just you know, sales, all this stuff.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:52.570Z)

like LTV, debt service coverage,

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:53.740Z)

I'm gonna have my that's what I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:55.830Z)

you you know, those type of metrics in

### You (2025-07-18T20:47:57.790Z)

data. Start to get a better track record.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:47:59.030Z)

maybe even on the summary page that it

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:01.010Z)

The data transfer.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:01.900Z)

connects with the debt and structured finance person.

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:02.880Z)

Digitalization. But, yeah,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:05.980Z)

I said a 150 k, and I know that's higher than the number we're talking about, but it would help cover some of the South some some salary to keep us alive for six months. And he

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:16.710Z)

the capital markets background and all of that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:18.460Z)

also thought,

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:20.010Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:20.420Z)

that he just gave me his feed we would be much

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:21.240Z)

but it's positive. It was a positive. Day. If someone saved me money,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:24.330Z)

better served spending our first year going

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:24.930Z)

be. Spend a 150 k with us to get it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:27.350Z)

after debt and structured finance teams.

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:27.720Z)

A dental. I know what you're right

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:30.400Z)

Because it's an easier underwriting

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:30.980Z)

in that. It was and interesting, and they liked it.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:33.580Z)

And the other thing we talked about is it would be very easier for an operator to for an owner to say to an operator,

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:33.950Z)

So okay. Don't know. That sounds exciting. It's probably hard to know. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:41.760Z)

transfer this information over to hotel biz. Right? Because it's just a refi. It's it's, like, no big deal. It's just not a sale. No one's gonna, I mean, get a I mean, that's my that's what I say. But

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:50.080Z)

that you know, at it from here.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:52.790Z)

I mean, it could help us with the data starting to get a better track

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:53.560Z)

But again, we're positive. If we can get a 150 k

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:57.250Z)

record with the

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:57.390Z)

there. That helps us get

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:48:58.150Z)

the data transfer and data digitalization.

### You (2025-07-18T20:48:59.510Z)

six months. Right to Alice. To have that

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:02.070Z)

But, again, what I wanna just say is,

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:02.820Z)

MVP. It would be a really nice win.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:04.190Z)

this is I have a small relationship, and this was just a teeny tiny conversation. Mark has the one with the

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:10.070Z)

For a lot less than that. Aside from a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:12.100Z)

big relationship and the capital markets background and all of that.

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:13.490Z)

founder compensation. And

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:17.070Z)

So, but it was positive. It was a positive day to hear someone say they might

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:17.910Z)

just put you know, I think more than we did talk the other day about

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:22.570Z)

spend a 150 k with us to get

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:22.880Z)

the the three of us who were talking about fighting

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:24.900Z)

a debt an underwriting product up and running in that

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:25.320Z)

couple of would be like

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:28.760Z)

it was unique and interesting and they liked it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:28.880Z)

how we call them, like, part you know, part of trying to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:31.950Z)

So Good. Good.

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:33.320Z)

real. That are, like, they're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:34.960Z)

Great.

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:37.030Z)

the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:37.120Z)

Sorry, Mark. I know I mean, at this at any point now, call he knows

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:37.310Z)

money. The head users for Bobby and B

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:41.760Z)

gonna reach out to him. He knows yeah. I mean, that

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:45.330Z)

to launch it. Yeah. I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:47.810Z)

you know, you'll be really taking it from here.

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:48.320Z)

I don't know. Yeah. And would provide a million dollars

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:50.700Z)

But again, it was positive. If we could get a 150 k out of

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:52.240Z)

I made it. But Granola has a

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:55.340Z)

to help us get six months, right, to Alice,

### You (2025-07-18T20:49:55.620Z)

very microphone, and he likes to use it up my den, and he likes to

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:49:58.960Z)

to have that MVP, it would be a really nice win.

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:00.360Z)

to talk about four trends.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:02.280Z)

Well, it sounds like the the we'll we'll be able to get to the MVP

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:02.730Z)

In the future. And so I think about trying to get leaders on our side, having

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:07.250Z)

for a lot less than that

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:08.640Z)

friends on our side,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:08.740Z)

aside from any

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:10.060Z)

would be

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:10.910Z)

founder compensation.

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:11.170Z)

really nice. Even if we have to go see capital on the

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:13.210Z)

Mhmm. And but, you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:15.020Z)

elsewhere. They

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:16.300Z)

I think, Mark, Diane, we we did talk the other day about

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:16.700Z)

they do well with them, I delivering

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:18.990Z)

I think it was

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:19.830Z)

a product

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:20.170Z)

the three of us when we were talking about finding

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:20.830Z)

that they like, definitely write us a letter, right, that we can take angel investors and so forth.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:22.620Z)

couple of groups that would be, like, how we call them, like, part like, sounding

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:26.980Z)

So so

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:29.300Z)

know, partners. Right? Like, three or four companies that are, like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:29.980Z)

that's just it's a it's a just wanted to say that.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:31.970Z)

they're gonna contribute the seed money, and they're gonna be the

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:32.760Z)

I I feel the positive thing. And I know we don't wanna show them what we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:36.270Z)

the heavy users of the MVP.

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:37.010Z)

got. Too early. But same time,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:39.590Z)

And provide all the feedback and and be, like, the companies we use to launch it.

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:39.660Z)

to what you said, Howard, make sure that we don't build too much in that we're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:43.970Z)

Yeah. Right?

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:44.560Z)

having to go back if we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:45.210Z)

And I don't know, like, that if PEACHTREE would provide a million dollars that that

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:46.130Z)

things because they're focused on different metrics for different factors, like,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:49.370Z)

I maybe I have skepticism. But Greg has a very big microphone, and he likes

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:51.890Z)

I mean, it's probably probably five times that more data is

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:55.410Z)

to use it on LinkedIn. And he likes to talk about forward trends,

### You (2025-07-18T20:50:56.200Z)

critical to Yeah. Yeah. So so just to finish

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:50:59.940Z)

the future. And so as we think about

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:02.330Z)

Do we now have

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:03.170Z)

trying to get leaders on our side, having Greg on our side,

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:03.200Z)

clear understanding of how much capital is needed for this sort of Labor Day

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:07.490Z)

would be really a a nice one. Even if we have to go see capital elsewhere,

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:08.960Z)

expedition, if you want? And and what

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:12.860Z)

I mean, they if we do well with them on delivering

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:14.280Z)

mean, do have that lockdown

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:17.180Z)

a product that they like, they would definitely write us a letter. Right, that we could take to angel investors and so forth. So,

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:22.060Z)

know, time is fine by So it'd be great. Could just start to put this

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:25.480Z)

so that's just

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:26.400Z)

x

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:27.970Z)

a it's a I just wanted to say it's a I I feel like it's a positive thing. And

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:28.100Z)

You know? Yeah. Place. Next week. Yeah. I I think from a product side,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:32.430Z)

know we don't wanna show them what we've got. It's too early. But at the same time,

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:32.820Z)

Diane, if you wanna just take what I input into that sheet or what Vinod and I had did,

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:37.130Z)

to what you said, Howard, we wanna make sure that we don't build too much in that we're then

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:40.640Z)

go ahead and bring it back over into the worksheet you have because

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:42.150Z)

having to go back and rebuild things because

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:43.720Z)

I don't have any of your budget data in there.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:44.710Z)

they're focused on different metrics or different factors. Like,

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:46.920Z)

So we're gonna have to take a look at things outside of what Vinod and I. But

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:49.220Z)

I mean, they probably told me five times that market data is critical to

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:52.220Z)

if we just take what Vinod's estimate was for the head count and

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:51:55.600Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So so just to finish the our early conversation, do we now have a

### You (2025-07-18T20:51:57.040Z)

increase it. Like I said, none of the other items are going to change. They're just

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:00.390Z)

clear understanding of how much capital is needed

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:00.990Z)

a fixed monthly fee. So Right. We should that should give us a good idea of what we what we need.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:03.750Z)

for this sort of Labor Day expedition, if you will.

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:06.500Z)

Okay. I realized I

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:07.800Z)

And and what we're gonna reasonably expect to receive

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:08.690Z)

stated over what we need. But I was just trying to frame something up.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:10.850Z)

as a result. I mean, do do we have that locked down?

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:13.250Z)

That he didn't blink.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:14.570Z)

Should we jump back to the schedule? Week is just

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:14.620Z)

I mean, that we didn't start that. The cost of an analyst for them.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:19.090Z)

know, time is flying by. So it'd be great if we could just start to put this x

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:24.220Z)

More If

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:25.600Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:25.710Z)

have more capital.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:26.140Z)

express mode in place next week.

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:26.680Z)

Right? So that's how you can put it out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, my my first conversation. Yeah. I was it's it's always easy to ask. And also, if we have say that. Food very

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:40.420Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:40.930Z)

crust. With the founding team. And you know, this quest which I not been a bit potentially, super excited about the hotel underwriting tool and how that can help them. Then said we have the right full time feeling too.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:56.620Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-18T20:52:56.760Z)

Do you like

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:52:59.350Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:03.150Z)

like, that's something we

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:04.630Z)

Okay. And I realized I stated over what we need, but I was just

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:05.320Z)

do. We have two adults and family. That's for. Or

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:08.880Z)

trying to frame something up.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:08.910Z)

we can

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:10.860Z)

He didn't even blink. I mean, they spend that. That's the cost of an analyst.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:14.820Z)

I just wanna

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:15.410Z)

For them. Right? That's less than the cost of an analyst for them. But but maybe there's a less

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:15.420Z)

to mention them? The the 2026 pipeline. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:19.450Z)

lesson there. Right? Maybe we can be doing know, more if we have more capital. Right? So that's something we should think about.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:23.660Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's stick to hotels deep

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:25.880Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It was just right, Marty. It was just my first conversation. It's it's always

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:28.670Z)

in hotels, when we start spreading ourselves out, that's

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:30.670Z)

it's always easier to ask for more and take less than than the opposite. So Yeah. It's

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:32.210Z)

that's a recipe for disaster. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:35.410Z)

And, also, maybe I'll just say this. He was very, very impressed with the founding team.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:40.640Z)

Properties.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:41.040Z)

And he asked this question, which I just nodded and said, potentially,

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:43.050Z)

As properties. So

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:45.980Z)

they're super excited about the hotel underwriting tool and how that can help them.

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:47.680Z)

you know.

### Guest (2025-07-18T20:53:50.770Z)

And then they said,

### You (2025-07-18T20:53:50.950Z)
