# Transcript for: Rajesh and Howard Berends - InnVestAI

### You (2025-09-10T14:02:35.578Z)

Hey. Good evening.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:02:38.458Z)

Hi, all. Good morning.

### You (2025-09-10T14:02:39.258Z)

How are you doing?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:02:39.738Z)

How are you?

### You (2025-09-10T14:02:40.218Z)

Good. Long time. About a year since. We got acquired and then dumped by Radix. So anyway.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:02:57.978Z)

I was numbered by.

### You (2025-09-10T14:03:00.858Z)

Yeah. That was an interesting ride. Oh, well. But things happen for a reason. How you doing?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:03:14.538Z)

Yeah, I'm doing good.

### You (2025-09-10T14:03:15.418Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:03:15.578Z)

Howard.

### You (2025-09-10T14:03:18.858Z)

So tell me, what was going on at Berkadia? And I hear that quite a few people left there.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:03:28.058Z)

Well, actually, they started laying up the people in 2024 forward. I'm not sure about uas, but there was two rounds happened in India office Hyderabad office. But they cited the reason, saying that it's a performance issue.

### You (2025-09-10T14:03:47.898Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:03:48.938Z)

So people was not concerned about it because they cited, okay, it's a performance issue or something. And recently this guy. Of course, I'm not sure whether you know or not. Indian side head Sudip and Indian HR head both were fired.

### You (2025-09-10T14:04:11.258Z)

Wear that.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:04:17.738Z)

Chief hr officer, head of human resources from us landed in india. Along with this guy who is the president. Randy Jensen or something. So they both land to announce that there are firing the Indian site later or the Indian head, operations head and HR head. So both were fired at one go. They didn't cite any reason. They said we will let them go. There was not even meaningful or formal send off for them. It was like very brutal. They didn't allow to allow them to office when they visited from us. And then also that layoff of both of them. And after one month. Srini, right? India. It had cini. So he was also about to get fired. But before that, he put his papers. Okay, I'll resign. Then Krishna who is currently Engineering vp, he was promoted to SVB position. Which means like he moved to C's position. He went to us for a short trip, like one week or so, and he returned from us. And also this lay of saying that. Nearly 20 from India was laid off, including me. Anubuti, even Steven's boss. And Stephen Pier also fired Shiva and Madan Chakulka, he was also fired around like 20, both product and design over.

### You (2025-09-10T14:06:10.538Z)

I heard that there was some conflict going on between Damu and Aglaia. And I heard that Damu had made some real major changes in the organization. But I never found out what exactly was going on. But, yeah, when I heard that Agla was no longer there, Something's weird. Something's going on here that just doesn't make sense.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:06:41.498Z)

Yeah. Yeah, that is also weird, Jeff, because we had a call with Aglai the day before she was fired. Like she left. Actually, I'm not sure what happened in the office. We had a meeting with Eglia on Monday. It went to 11. She was in good mood. I mean, I didn't say anything. Something is going wrong, be understood. Something like at all. On the very same day, I mean in the US End of the usrs we have received an email from Dom was saying that Agla is no longer with Beria. We were shocked actually.

### You (2025-09-10T14:07:17.978Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:07:21.258Z)

Because I don't know. We don't know what has happened.

### You (2025-09-10T14:07:23.018Z)

The only thing I heard is there was. A meeting with damu and gary and agla. And Damu wanted to make changes in the organization. And I think it kind of came down to shifting some things over to Gary. And from what I heard, Aglaja was caught off guard. That none of this was discussed with her. It was kind of a Damu and Gary conversation. And I heard that she in the meeting was mentioned that she was totally unaware of this and could they get together the next day? And continue to discuss it. And I was told that when she came in the office the next day, they just let her go. I've heard a lot of people discussing Damu and not quite sure what was going on. It was described to me as a power struggle. Which may or may not be the case, I don't know. But, yeah, I was very surprised because Berkadia, I consider them to be the best employer I've worked with. But to have something like that happen in such a major shakeup. It's very surprising because we went from. Them saying, we've never laid off anybody. We're doing everything that we can to all of a sudden, Boom, you know, a bunch of people gone. So I knew Maran was gone as well. Is Steven still there? I haven't talked to Steven in a while.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:09:35.018Z)

Yeah, Stephen is there Steven Friendly. I mean, college made sure something chew us. He also is his peer of Stephen. Of course he was. They were classmates.

### You (2025-09-10T14:09:37.098Z)

It's good.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:09:49.258Z)

Even told me that they were school beds or a college mate or something.

### You (2025-09-10T14:09:51.098Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:09:52.698Z)

He's also reporting to Madan. And that guy is behind the BERKI initiative. Actually, he successfully launched berqi, and he got all the applauds, and he was praised for this BERKI initiative. Interestingly, I mean, it was shocking as well. He got fired.

### You (2025-09-10T14:10:11.098Z)

Yep. Yeah, it is. It's just a weird thing. And it's a bad time. I mean. The whole tech industry is just in a real bad place. I don't know how else to put it. Here since January. I think Microsoft is not. I think they announced, like 11,000 layoffs back in January, February, and then another 15,000 a couple months ago. I mean, everybody, you know, the big companies meta. Everybody is laid off. Tens of thousands of people and. Yeah, to try and find a job, at least in the us it's like if you've worked for, you know, the main group, meta, you know, Apple, Amazon, all of those companies, Google, everybody looks at that as being like the ultimate. Right. So if I'm in a position where I'm competing for a job with somebody from one of those companies, and I've got all these tiny little companies on my resume that you've never heard of. It's like I don't have a chance. I've come up against. Same thing you mentioned that you've been out for two months and only had two interviews. I've been out for eight months and I've only had one response to a resume. And 30 minutes before my interview was supposed to start, I got an email saying, well, we just offered. All right. So, yeah, I've gotten zero responses. And of course, ageism. Is very rampant. Here, you know, I'm up against people half my age. It's just like a pretty much. Thrown in the towel. I It's been probably a good six weeks since I sent in a resume, although I did send one in this past week end. For a position. But, yeah, I'm either overqualified or too old or whatever. So, anyway, that kind of. Kind of brings me to. To what's going on. I don't know if you remember not. I would have probably just mentioned it in passing, but it's been two years now. When Berkadia opened up the hospitality office for hotels. There was a lady named Diane Fox. Who is a consultant in the hotel industry. And she knew all of the people in the Berkadia office from over the years. And she reached out to them. And wanted to know if there was any possibility of redi Q getting involved in the hospitality. And so they set up a couple of meetings, and that's how I met Diane. She is very. Adamant. That you know there is nothing in the hotel space. Like redIQ. So at the time, it's like, yeah, I mean, this. This. This might work. But, you know, we were going through our roadmap and we were looking at, you know, like, the self storage areas. I mean, we were looking at all these different asset classes, but hotel was kind of down the list. So she would just contact me, like, every few months, and, you know, hey, how's it going? Any opportunity, any chance you guys are gonna start on this? And I kept putting it back. And then after Radix purchased redIQ, She reached out again. And at that time, I said, look, you know, Radix had no interest whatsoever. In anything other than multifamily. And I that kind of told her that. It's like, look, we're not gonna do anything. But she's very persistent. And it was just pure coincidence almost. Kind of Almost like a God thing, right? That just, like a couple weeks after Radix let everybody go. She contacted me again through LinkedIn. I'm like, all right, let's talk. So we got together and talked. And, you know, she started going on again about how, you know, there is nothing in the hotel industry like redIQ. Everybody does everything in Excel, blah, blah, blah. You know, same old story that we've heard. And I thought, okay, well, then I started to do some actual research. And found out she was absolutely right. They have. Revenue management software. They have just day to day operations like, you know, with real Page and Yardy and MRI and those for the apartment communities. They have a few specialized things for the daily management. But absolutely nothing. For acquisitions. So I think, okay, she's. She's right. So we started to talk, and in February, we decided to go for it. We're gonna build something similar to redIQ. We're not going to have any type of Excel connection. Basically, it's like, you know, because with redIQ, I was trying to say we got to get first pass up and running. Archer and all these companies have leapfrogged us. They're able to process documents and spit out evaluation very quickly. We need to do the same. And so now we've got an opportunity. To to do that. So fast forward. The node bot was one of them that was let go. He is helping us now. So he's our primary developer, but he's got a full time job. So right now he. He did find a position. But he's basically working two jobs. And we've got four, well, three others. So. So Vinod and I are the product in engineering team. And then we've got Diane who founded it. But then there's also a gentleman named Mark Gordon, he has been in the hotel industry. For more than 30 years, he actually led the National. Team. For hospitality for cbre for many years. You know, cbre is the largest broker in the u.s. then he went out on his own. And now he's also involved with hotel development. So he's been a broker. For the nation's largest organization. He's done his own brokerage. Now he builds hotels and resorts. He knows everybody in the industry. Diane has been in the industry for 30 years. She knows everybody in this street. So we've got deep, deep reach into anybody who. Basically, the who's who of hotels. And then we've got another name, Drew. And Drew also started his own. Hotel analytics. Company. So he ingests. Some data from the hotels. Any kind of maps it. So he. He is more like his company is more like an asset management. Tool. Where they upload the data each month the need puts together. He's just using power bi. But he's kind of stalled out. He's gotten to the point where he's got some very large clients. But just can't seem to. To go anywhere. So we're actually looking at merging the two. So we've got that. That data as well. So we have already. We're still in the startup. So I used Lovable, the no code tool, and I built the proof of concept. Using lovable. And the nice thing is, in hotels, there's no such thing as a rent roll, so everything is based off of financial statements. And they have a standardized financial statement. Process. So there might be little bit different ways of how it's displayed on the paper, but it's a very standardized chart of accounts. So you've got basically, you know, way different than multifamily. Multifamily was all over the place. So actually, the back end is not difficult at all. So now Vinod has three developers based in India. That are contract workers. Who are now taking my proof of concept and building it out into a production platform on aws. And we expect to have that done within the next three weeks. And then we are going to go out and get investors. But we already have two committed and a third that's ready. So we already have investors coming in. The problem is when you're very. When you're first starting out, you don't have any clients. You don't have any customers. The investors are. I mean, one is investing 50,000 and other ones. Investing 75,000, which is enough to cover the back end expenses. So none of us are drawing an income right now. It's. It's all sweat equity, etc. But once we have that mvp, Ready. To go out. We've got others committed to invest. So it's not a matter of if we get the money, it's just a matter when. How soon we can get that. And on top of that, CBRE has agreed to let 8 of their business analysts be beta testers for us, as well as a couple of other companies. So there will be a period of time starting in October, probably through the end of the year, where we have these beta testers that are basically going to do side by side. You know, they'll do their underwriting the way they always do in Excel. They'll use our model and compare the results, making sure everything ties, etc. And at that point, then we will be ready to go to general release. AI plays a big part of what we're doing. So, you know, using AI more than OCR to process the financial statements. And of course, one of the very first features that will be releasing as part of our beta test is just like an AI generated summary. Vinod gave us a demo of it last night. So, basically, it takes all the data that you have in our model. Goes out and gets data from whatever the market is. I put together a beta test of this earlier about 2 months ago using a tool for deep research, and I put in the name of a hotel that I used to stay at all the time in a previous job. I put in the name and the address. I basically was a very simple basic prompt to basically just said, you'll find all the tax information, tax records. Find all the previous sale history and give me a list of the five comps. And it came back in two or three minutes. And I had all of that put together. Like, wow, this is. I mean, I. I knew all the hotels because sometimes that hotel was booked and I'd stay at the other one. So I knew the comps were right. They were the right comps. They came back with. The tax records. It came back with previous sales. So, I mean, that stuff is kind of very easy. But we want to. Get way more into, like, the agentic AI. Another nice thing about the industry is that there are a couple of organizations out there that already have, like, a unique identifier for the properties. So, you know, I'm still learning about the hotel industry. But it's very common for, you know, you might have a Marriott hotel. And then it's sold and it becomes a Hilton. Or a Hyatt or something else, right? Name will change, whatever. But because it has a unique identifier, we know that that hotel, you know, it was a Marriott a few years ago or whenever. Right. So that allows. It makes it much easier for us to get the market data because we're not worried about the name of property. It's always that. Unique identifier that we can get up there. Unfortunately, that doesn't. Affect every property. Right. There are still some small hotels or individual hotels that may not have that identifier assigned. But it just blows me away that every other real estate asset class has this type of tool. But not in the hotel industry. So we are looking to become a very, very deep vertical in the hospitality. No interest in going out to other hospitality types. But we've already had conversations with other third party data providers. A lot of different companies where we will actually kind of like, be the aggregator. And that's another thing that surprises me. Like in the multifamily. Bait. Those. Those third party providers, they don't want to work with others, they want to protect their data. The people we've talked to, they're like, yeah, I think that's a great idea. Let's. Let's do. I'm like, this is just coming a little bit. Way too easy. I didn't. I never expected it, you know, to work that way. So the bottom line is, I am reaching out to you. But I'm only planting the seed. Right now for you to. To think about it and to consider, because my focus needs to be just on the core product. And working with some of these other parties on the integration. I need somebody. That can focus on the AI features. And what can we do? Because, you know, we're looking at having a core model that the people will subscribe to, and then we can add some of these other features as add ons. Right. So depending on the size the organization or what they want to do, you know, we could have some of these additional AI based features. We are planning to do a marketplace, which is one of the things I was working on at Radix before they let everybody go because, you know, we're going. We've identified six different Personas. So you've got the investors and the brokers. That's the obvious one. But lenders and appraisers. Use these tools as well. And then asset managers, and then also banks or processors. And so with the lenders and the brokers, what I was putting together at Radix was, you know, because we already had a lot of broker clients, investor clients, we wanted to do, you know, like, deal sharing is what they had there. So a broker could create a deal and then share it with the investors. And it would be just like a Zillow or type of online, but instead of everybody being able to view it, it would be our brokers and our investors. And we have the exact same opportunity here with the hotel industry. So those are the things that we've got going on. You know, I've got a massive list of AI based features that we want to get in, theoretically. And I say that because there are already other companies out there that do this, because there's already a lot of this centralized data in the hospitality industry. It could get to the point where, you know, they could plug in the name and the address, put in that identifier, input their minimum returns on their investments. And boomed, AI could go and fill in the model for them. You know, we're going to take baby steps on that. So, you know, like the, like the AI summary is the first step where AI will go in there and it'll show you. Well, here's, here's what your investment assumptions came out, and here's the market. And are you relatively in alignment? You know, the next step is, you know, we would know what are the average cap rates and what are the revenues and expenses in this market. And we could have that go back and pre populate the model so that they don't even have to input this information. But then ultimately it'd be like I mentioned, so if I'm an investor and I have a partner that says I need a minimum return of 12% and we're gonna put in this amount of money, we can kind of back into that. Data and say, okay, if this is what you need, this is how you have to underwrite it. And then it becomes a very simple thing. It's like, okay, can I operate the deal with this parameters? Or not, if I can't do it, if it's not possible to meet this investor's criteria, Well, I need to go out and find another investor or change places there, so that's. That's where we are, so. You know, I loved working with you. I think you're the best product owner and product manager that I've worked with. So you were the first one that I thought of. But I'm not in a position right now to say, you know, I'd like to hire you because we don't have the funding yet to pay a salary. However, there could be some consulting or even project based work that we might be able to do so. If that's something you would be interested in, start thinking about, number one, consulting. If we were to be able to work together on particular projects or something like that, you know, what rate would you be comfortable charging? Right? Something like that. So that we could maybe go incrementally until the point where we could bring somebody on board. Best case scenario is it could be, you know, sometime within six to eight weeks. It all depends on how quickly we can get our investors to actually write a check and give it to us. Or it could be. After the first of the year, right? Could be January, February. I don't know. At this point, it would just be a guess, so. What do you think? Just. I've been rambling on for quite a while. But what questions do you have? Concerns. Is it something that you might be interested in? Something you have no interest in whatsoever?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:33:01.018Z)

It's pretty much sounds interesting. Over. But yeah, Couple of questions. So the earlier you mentioned, like there are three developers. From India, actually. Are there, like, contractors? I mean, are they from our professional network or, like, their random ly hired?

### You (2025-09-10T14:33:13.098Z)

Yeah. The node. We hired two of them, and they're actually. The first two, I would say, are very junior. They're young. They've only been out of school for maybe a year. They are good coders. But he's had to go back and help them change a couple things. We had three. One of them only lasted for a week or two. Just Vinod learned that the guy was just not very good, but he just replaced him. With a senior. Developer. So, but they are contract. And the first two that he hired are still with us. And like I said, he knew them or had connections with them. The third is somebody that he found through a search. And so far, the senior developer has been working very well. So they are not employees. Like I said, we don't have any employees. But as a contract. Work, we were able to bring them on. I should say two of our founders, Mark, the broker, Andrew, who has his own business, they have put in some money into an account, so we have enough money to pay the contractors through the end of the year and probably beyond, plus covering our backend expenses, the AWS and everything that goes on with that. So it's not like they're doing swine adequately. But myself. Diane, are 100% sweat equity. We have no income coming in at all. And then Vinod has the income from this other job, but he's also not getting paid technically from our company yet either.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:35:26.858Z)

Okay? So this product, I mean, who would be the end users of the pursuers? It's like the folks who are focusing on mergers and acquisitions or like similar to redIQ. I mean, there will be portfolio brokers, underwriters, portfolio manager, something like that. Like, who'll be there and use.

### You (2025-09-10T14:35:47.818Z)

The user base will be exactly like RunIQ. Probably won't have time to do it now, but if you want to get together again sometime soon, I can show you the proof of a concept that I put together. It's a functioning proof of concept, but one of the things in the hotel industry, like I mentioned. Everything is uniform in terms of how they group the revenue and the expenses.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:35:48.378Z)

Personal. As for this.

### You (2025-09-10T14:36:16.698Z)

And one thing that is unique in there is that they've got. Remember, a hotel can have restaurants and gift shops. And a resort could have a golf course and all these different things. And a lot of times they're treated like a business within a business. But how you budget and account for those differs by Persona. So, for example, the top line item for food and beverage. Is just food and beverage. But within that you have is a fine dining. Is it just the breakfast? Is it a coffee kiosk, things like that? So people like lenders and appraisers. They don't care about the individual. They just budget by the food and beverage. Right? They don't care if it's fine dining or anything else. So those are going to be our first beta testers. And some of the other under our disebre who's just testing it. They'll just compare their roll up to the food and beverage. So then we will start working on how we drill down into the lower levels, right? So investors and brokers. Are the ones who will want to get down into the minutiae. So they will be our second group that we roll out. And then asset managers, they're not really looking to buy or sell. They're putting. They're operating the data. And so that's the same thing as the redIQ lifecycle. Management suite, right? So they're the ones who will upload data every month. Track it, do what they need to do. And that will be our last group. Probably won't get to that until maybe second quarter of next year. So, yeah, we've got exact same Personas, but when we release on day one, it's really only going to be focusing on lenders and appraisers in that group.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:38:45.658Z)

So, I mean, this role, I mean, you call it as a Pam or PO consultant whatsoever. So what is your expectation from this role? Over.

### You (2025-09-10T14:39:00.378Z)

First off, I need somebody that I can trust to just pick up and run with it, and I don't need to hold their hand, and I know that that's you. Would be. An individual contributor. And also would be key to building an offshore team. For us engineers. So we're not really. I mean, we're really considering ourselves to be a product led to organization. It's not sales led. We don't have a sales team. So really? Vinod and I don't act like engineering and product. It's like we're one group. And we want to continue that way. So, you know, we would need your product owner. Experience to manage the backlog, do all the usual product management stuff along with product owner, but we need somebody who can lead an offshore team. And focus on AI centric projects. Is what we're looking for. We could continue with the same group of developers that we have now, whether they be contract or bring them on full time, whatever we end up doing. But they would probably be working more on the core features. And the thing is, an I would be focusing on with data integrations, partnership integrations, APIs, things like that. But I envision this as kind of a separate, specialized team. That would be focusing on that.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:41:01.418Z)

Testing. So is there any timeline for, like, initial release or MVP at this point? I mean,

### You (2025-09-10T14:41:12.058Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:41:12.378Z)

The timeline for this.

### You (2025-09-10T14:41:12.698Z)

Yeah. So, you know, I put together the proof of concept. The mvp. For the lender and appraiser is we're, we're hoping to have it complete by the end of September. There is a big conference in the US on October 6th. Which Mark is going to be. He's actually going to be moderating a panel, so he's gonna have a high profile. He wants to use that as the launching platform. To introduce InnVestAI to the industry. We don't have to have it 100% running, but if he can show how we can upload an operating statement, extract the data, map it into the tool, and then what Vinod showed yesterday, after you go through and build it, you can push this button and it Berends out this beautiful little AI summary overview. That would be huge. So we don't have to have the point where he would go through and input all the different assumptions and everything else. But I think. I think we can meet that. I think we'll be in a good place to get to where he could sit down with somebody, open up his laptop and show them how it. Works and they would get a very good idea. So after that, we're looking at at least 60 days, maybe 90 days of beta testing. While the developers go and kind of change the MVP to version one. So a lot of the things in the MVP. We know that there's going to be bugs and everything else. So while they're working on that, I'm going to be working directly with our beta testers and get whatever feedback they've got and incorporate what we can into version one. And that we probably could be done as soon as December, but. With holidays, vacations, everything like that, it's not a good time to release. So we're looking at probably January to where we could just make the big announcement, get all the marketing material out there and start bringing in general release clients, so. Yeah. So it would be. The team that I'm putting together. For the AI version they would also be working on. Version one and beyond. Right. I will, actually. I trust you. You're not going to go and share all this information with competitors. I'm going to send you a document. Yeah, I actually have a long term AI roadmap. Let me send that to you just so you can kind of get an idea. Of what it is that we can do. What I would be looking for. From this role. Get you going on that. Anyway, what else? What other questions?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:44:53.898Z)

That's all I had over.

### You (2025-09-10T14:44:54.778Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:44:57.818Z)

It. It sounds industry.

### You (2025-09-10T14:44:57.818Z)

Yeah. So anyway. We were talking about, you know, how. How are we going to. Bring AI into our organization. Is it going to be someone in the engineering team who can go out and build it? Is it going to be somebody on the product team who can look out? And we actually made the decision just last week that, yeah, it makes more sense to have somebody in the product side. Lead that initiative, work with the engineers and go from there. So again, you know, it's. It's early in. In the game. But I thought it would be worthwhile. For you and I to have this conversation. You know, just. I wish I could have you start tomorrow. But we. We need. We need somebody to give us money. You can start tomorrow if you want to do sweat equity and not get paid, but I don't think that's really not going to help you out much. But anyway, that's. That's kind of where we are right now. So I just want to be as straightforward as I can to set expectations. But, man, I would love to have you in this position. That's. That's the best I can say.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:46:32.618Z)

Like as you are aware. The vision we have for this product. Is like leveraging. As much as we can.

### You (2025-09-10T14:46:45.578Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:46:47.098Z)

The name itself says, like invest.

### You (2025-09-10T14:46:47.738Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:46:52.218Z)

That, you know, during my career tenure or like redIQ tenure, Vihana worked on any so called heavy AI initiatives set up.

### You (2025-09-10T14:46:57.178Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:47:04.138Z)

So to put that in a simpler term. It zero to no knowledge on AI. So how would I will be helpful for this question? I mean initially it's like a learning curve for me as well. If I jump into this project like product.

### You (2025-09-10T14:47:21.418Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:47:23.898Z)

It will be in a learning curve initially. So if someone is there to guide us at least like on some initial, initial AI things or like we have to self learn, explore and you know, materialize that what was your thoughts or plans?

### You (2025-09-10T14:47:45.098Z)

We're all in the same position. So unless you had the specialized training and have worked for OpenAI or Anthropic, something like that. Pretty much everybody in the industry is kind of learning as we go, and things change so fast. You know, almost weekly, somebody will release this great new feature, OpenAI release GPT5, while all of a sudden anthropic and then meta and all these other ones have the same thing. And somebody else will release something, right? So it. It changes so quickly that nobody can keep up with everything. I've described myself as an AI Fanboy for, you know, ever since it came out. But what I have found most useful is there are so many free resources that you don't have to go and take college level courses or pay $1,000 for a boot camp. You know, I can always send you a list of the resources that I subscribe to. I mean, I get probably four or five daily newsletters. A lot of them have the exact same information, but each one will give me some new information. And there are some free training courses that are out there. And it's basically, you know, there's one called 100 days of AI which I really enjoyed. And literally, for 100 days, you get an email and here's your project for the day. Tells you what tools to use, how to use them, gives you, you know, a lesson. Basically, you complete it. Sometimes it takes, you know, maybe 30 minutes a day to do it. But hands on. Is the best way to. To do it that I've learned. But when we get to the engineering team, Our goal is to bring on an engineer who can build it right so you can come up with the ideas. You can put down the guidelines and what are expected outcome is. But I would not expect you to build the tool right? We would need to bring in an engineer who has experience in doing all of this. So the node has already done a good job of setting up using the Amazon bedrock. AI LLM so. We are 100% internal. We don't send anything out to ChatGPT or Claude or anything else. It's all done within hours. And so we've already addressed the security issues. Because that's the biggest thing. Everybody comes up. Well, I don't want my data going out to chatgpt. And, you know, at first I was like, what's the big deal? It's not a big deal. But then a couple weeks ago, I don't know if you saw the article, but X AI has. Basically all of these chats that people have put in, we're showing up in Google searches. Wait a minute. Maybe there is something to this. And a lot of them were personal, contain some free, personal, intimate information that people were, you know, having these chats about. So we would never be in that position because everything we would have would be within our box. Never goes out anywhere else. So all we need now is somebody who is skilled in putting together agents. And putting together workflows using tools like Naten or different things out there. To automate that. It's. It's the automation part of where. Somebody can put in a request in a chat. And then agents can go out. Like the one that I did with the hotel I had. You know, one agent went out to get tax records, another one went out for sales. And they gathered the information, bring it back and consolidate it so. Let me send you the information that I have, and if you don't mind, I'll put together an email that has some like. Like those newsletters that I look for, the old links to the other ones. In a month or two, you can become an expert. In. Not. Not an expert in AI. I'm not an expert in AI, but. No, enough about AI so that you would be competent in putting together a PRD and knowing you know how to get something, where to get something, and then let the engineers make it happen. All right. Anything else.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:53:34.138Z)

Yeah, that's all I have is your family and all.

### You (2025-09-10T14:53:35.258Z)

All right. Well, yeah, I was just gonna ask how your dad is doing. Well, good.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:53:41.658Z)

Yeah, he's doing good. Thanks for asking.

### You (2025-09-10T14:53:42.858Z)

Good, good. All right. Yeah. Families. Family's doing well. We are officially empty nesters now. My daughter moved into a house with some friends about three weeks ago, so just myself and my wife hanging out here. Been quiet. Been kind of nerve wracking. It's like I would rather have her here where I can keep an eye on her, you know? It's like, what is she doing?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:54:11.978Z)

Yeah. Initially, we feel that. Yeah. Until we get used.

### You (2025-09-10T14:54:15.738Z)

Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Anyway, everything's going well. Summer is over. My wife is back to teaching at the university, so. All right. Let me. Let me send you some of that information. Let's keep in touch. So I'll send it. Actually, do I have your email? I know we've been talking on LinkedIn. Would you be able. Oh, there you are. Looked like you froze for a minute. There.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:54:47.818Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-10T14:54:48.938Z)

Yeah, can you shoot me your email on LinkedIn and then I'll just send this stuff during me to you?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:54:50.218Z)

Of course.

### You (2025-09-10T14:54:57.738Z)

Okay? All right, Sounds good. So good catching up. You know, Sorry. That you were one of the few. You know, one of the many. Were downsized. From Berkadia. At least I know it had nothing to do with your job performance. That's for sure. So I actually have been part of mass layoffs. Five times now. Real estate is very cyclical, but it's still. It's kind of weird. It's like, okay, I didn't quit because of my. It wasn't my choice. I was let go. From an organization. But there's a difference between downsizing and losing your job because of performance. And so a lot of times I still feel like, oh, I have to explain. Why did I leave that job? You know? No, I wasn't fired. I was one of many that wouldn't let go. But it's. It's still kind of weird, you know? It's like. Because. Yeah. Yeah. The thing that has always bothered me is, like, okay, well, what about the people who stayed?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:56:12.218Z)

Agree.

### You (2025-09-10T14:56:20.858Z)

Were they? That much better than I was. Is there a reason why they stayed and I was let go? I don't know that that's a question that you know, if it ever comes into your mind. Push it out, because there's. There is no answer to that, you know, and it's almost never the. The list of who to stay keep and who. Who to go, who's who goes. Almost never comes down to job performance. It's about. Areas within the organization that they need to trim back. And it's like, okay, this department here, we don't need. This department here, we only need to keep a few. So anyway, I kind of. You know, have struggled with that in the past, and I hope you don't. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:57:14.218Z)

Yeah, like there were that. You know, I'm from redIQ.

### You (2025-09-10T14:57:20.138Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:57:22.138Z)

So I'm not from servicing, so they wanted us to let go.

### You (2025-09-10T14:57:24.378Z)

Yeah. Yep. All right. Well, I hope to talk to you soon. Between now and whenever. If you have any questions, let me know. Again, like I said, think about what a consulting work could look like between now and when we can make this a full time position. Perhaps there's. Perhaps there's something we can do along those lines. But I'll send you all this information you can get familiar with it. Decide if it's something that you would be interested in, and we'll go from there. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:58:05.978Z)

Share, Howard. Let me give it a thought.

### You (2025-09-10T14:58:06.778Z)

All right. Talk to you soon. All right, Take care.

### Guest (2025-09-10T14:58:12.618Z)

Bye. Good. Day.
