# Transcript for: Howard + Diane 

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:10:31.425Z)

Possible fractional CFO for us. Right? He, like, helping us get through, like, just setting up the QuickBooks and starting to handle some of the funds and things like that. But that's not the real reason why I want us to think about a partnership with him in some way. It's the cap ax piece of it because. Right. I believe that we need to start building right now, trying to get in and figure out over the next 12 to 24 months how to build a product that starts to link the Capex and the renovation piece to the underwriting. He's done that. I mean, he's done that. Right. And so just like you with rediq, he brings the technology knowledge outside. Does this make sense? And so I think he's great. He's, he's earlier in his career and then the last thing I'll mention is he has this. Really interesting idea that has stuck with me. And that is, you know, he has been involved with software where the software almost gets commoditized, right? Like, he. He hated how Rabbit was. He hated how Taylor Bird was. And so he feels like that when you marry a technology strategy with a. And it's not when. I consulting. But the consulting isn't actually part of the SaaS platform. It almost sits separately. But they're inter. They're. They have. They're interwoven. Right, because what you're doing is all the. All of our customers. What he wants to be able to do is go in and help. Advise them on how to build their tech stacks. So this might be. They use us, they use Yardi, they use mri, they use Juniper. Right, Like. And like, help them say, okay, this is the right tech stack for you.

### You (2025-12-01T14:12:17.108Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:12:17.425Z)

I love that idea because I think that's a. It's a very complicated thing for most investment firms to, like, be able to do that. And it ties just perfectly right into our strategy. So that. So I wanted to give you that background. It's an introductory call with Mike Skiba. I would love to figure out a way to work with him in some way, but that's tomorrow morning. We have a call with Mike Tanner. Mike Tanner is my uncle, in full disclosure, but he's also a very experienced. He's worked in technology his entire career. He's worked in SaaS his entire career. He's a fractional marketing executive for SaaS. There's a term for it, but he's offered to help us with our go to market strategy and I think working with someone who knows nothing about what we're doing. He spent some time in prop tech. It was a company called Lesser that was owned by or was, I think it was a fifth wall company and it was prop tech. It was around outsourced repair and maintenance.

### You (2025-12-01T14:12:42.948Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:13:30.145Z)

Support. But why? I really. My uncle's very, very smart, and if we can iterate and show him what the idea is and get it on paper, I think it'll go a long way for us to be able to explain it to people. Does that make sense? Because he knows nothing about it and he's offered to help. And so that is something that we're going to be doing on Thursday.

### You (2025-12-01T14:13:47.428Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:13:58.465Z)

I internally have reached out to Driftwood to try to get a call with Carlos this week. I'm just going to downplay the whole thing as just like, you know, I have to figure. In fact, we need to figure out a script, right, that we can just go to script on this, that we don't. Deviate from that's positive, but shows how just silly and stupid the whole thing is. And then we have that call with Mark Woodworth on Friday that I don't want to cancel. And I know Drew was pretty scary with the whole, like, engineering team and things like that. We can talk about that with Sherben tomorrow night, But I. I want to keep that call if we can, and that's a call. It's like a discovery call. But it's also. We have to be pitching, too, right? We want them to want to work with us in some way, so it's right. Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:14:45.188Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:14:48.945Z)

So that's this week. And then we have Jessica. And Jessica got moved to Thursday, but I almost put Jessica at the very, very top because we're. We need help figuring out what the right structure is. Right. Like you said it before, like, we're all partners, but, like, we need to figure out, like, what. Is actually. What structure do we need to create that would be attractive for people to invest in? Right. We've just learned our less. I've Learned my lesson. 20. 20. 20. 2020 doesn't work. Jessica was really dead on when she said that. So what will work? I never want to be in a position. Again where I have two partners that could at this early of a stage.

### You (2025-12-01T14:15:14.228Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:15:34.145Z)

How do I say this to partners that could result in a coup that kicks me out of voting rights. Right. That's like. And I realize there will come a day where that will happen when we sell and there's maybe a change of leadership that's required. But not today. That day is not today. And so we got to figure out, like, I have to figure out what kind of right. Like, I don't want that to happen to me. We have to figure out. I'm like, I think you're in agreement. All four, like, economic participation for Jessica, if she can come in and help us. Figures some of the things that we don't have figured out out. Including Sherben. Because when I explain what Sher's offer is, there's good and there's bad, and somewhere in the middle of it, there is a solution.

### You (2025-12-01T14:15:39.988Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yep. Right. Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:16:24.065Z)

But it's not as easy as a friend just helping a friend out. His offer comes with a lot of conditions, some of which are just not. Not okay, so. And we. Can we go into that. But those are all the. Those are like. Those are actions, right? Those are things that. That are this week that we can do to help pull ourselves in a positive direction.

### You (2025-12-01T14:16:48.788Z)

Okay? I agree. I agree.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:16:50.865Z)

So, okay, so what about the software engineering team? Like, what are your thoughts there?

### You (2025-12-01T14:16:58.388Z)

Well, first off, let me. Let me ask you. I watched the video. I. Recorded it using my. Transcription tool. If you look at. The team. 's recording. Anytime there's, like, a gap in words, it starts it off as a new sentence. And so I don't trust it as a transcript to be able to be reviewed and summarized, so. I don't recall. Anything about the. About marks. Engineering team. Mark. Mark that we're meeting with on Friday. So what. What did Drew say? Or maybe I just missed it or skimmed over it.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:17:51.665Z)

He said Drew declared that he was he, we, we would be getting a cease and desist. And that meant the engineering team had to stop working.

### You (2025-12-01T14:17:58.948Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:18:01.905Z)

They had to stop working on this and they could not, like, work. We could not do any work with Mark Woodworth or anything like that.

### You (2025-12-01T14:18:03.428Z)

O. H I thought. Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah, I. I don't. I don't believe that's true at all. I. I really think we can just keep going. But maybe that's just something we have to talk to Sherbet about. And see. I mean, I'm not going to slow down.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:18:36.865Z)

Was it Granola? Like, how did the Granola script read? Worse or better? Or. I'm just curious, when you read through the transcript, better. Okay.

### You (2025-12-01T14:18:42.468Z)

Better. The granolas. Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't. Anytime there's a gap, it doesn't necessarily just automatically make it a new sentence. It does a really good job of realizing that, you know, the speaker just took. So it makes it. It is clear. I'll. I'll go back. I know you mentioned this. I. I thought you meant Mark Woodworth's. Engineering team. Something about that. When? When you made a comment earlier. Okay. All right, so I'm not worried about that. I, I I think you know, here. I did reply to Mike and copied everybody, so you're probably already aware. You know, my. My take is. Basically, Mark and Drew, up until this point have done nothing but consulting. They haven't contributed. Anything new or proprietary to the tool. Drew in particular. Has provided. Spreadsheets. Most of which didn't technically belong to him. He even made a comment about, you know. Not. Making sure with that, that people don't know because he's sharing spreadsheets that were sent to him. So I went, I'm not saying we should blackmail him, but I think that's something that, you know, needs to be talked about. But I. I really believe at this point, He has made suggestions. But. Everything. And, yeah, I. I don't want to make this sound arrogant, but everything on that avm, the POC that we're putting together, and mvp. For things that. That I originally put together. Based on the models that were out there. So the KPI cards, you know, and all of the expand and contract. These are all things that I put together. And Drew helped and provided his opinion. On it. So you know, any claim to. You know, that, that, that. Yeah, I just kind of feel he has, like, zero claim to any intellectual property. Maybe as a partner. Because he has been reviewing, he's been putting in time. But I. I don't see where he's actually contributed. Anything new? To. To what we put together, right? You know one thing I don't think he. Knows, you know, by degrees in finance. I've been a number cruncher in in real estate investment for 30 plus years. So when it comes down to the model and noi and all other stuff, This had, you know, any question I had was, is there a particular nuance in hotel that I need to be aware of? You know, I've never worked with RevPAR and ADR. Right. But he didn't invent those. He didn't come in. Right. So I just, I. I think the whole IP and the cease and desist is basically, they. I don't think they ever like to stand on.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:22:09.185Z)

Great.

### You (2025-12-01T14:22:22.468Z)

And, you know, he probably doesn't realize that I was Director of Business Intelligence for Bell Partners. I was Director of Business Intelligence for Aum. Who then got bought by Real Page. I have been in the business of creating and building dashboards longer than he has. You know, I was working in Power BI back in 2012, 2013. I mean, basically from the day it was released. So, you know, when it comes down to those types of things, my experience building dashboards and the how you make that up. Is is double his. So again, I'm not gonna. I'm not trying to be arrogant. I'm just saying. I just don't think he has. And. Yeah, I'm just. Yeah, I'm just. Yeah. I can't think he's got anything. Substantial, that would be anything. And that's. That's why I really think, you know, if. If Mike talks to their representative and if we do give them some type of a offer, That's really all they've got to go on. You know, there's nothing. No cork can shut this down. Nobody's going to be doing anything. I'm not. So, you know, I. Strange things can always happen, but I just don't see any. Anything other than a temporary hiccup.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:23:59.985Z)

Funny. It's just a really. I don't. I. Maybe this is funny. I feel like to me, this resonates. I've met Kevin Scoffman, if I'm saying his last name correctly, a few times in person. He is at Cherry. He. When I met him, he was the chief Innovation Officer. He may have a different title now, but I remember one of the first times I met him, he said to me, yes, you're not a technology company until you've gotten your first cease and desist. And he that for him, a cherry that came. He was talking about CoStar right at the time that Costar had issued cease and desist. But I just. That I remembered that, and it's like, okay, well, guess what? We just got our first cease and desist, right where there will be many others to come. And we should, instead of being like, we should be proud of it and, like, you know, frame it and put it on our wall. It's like, guess what? We're now tech. We're a real technology company. We've gotten our first cease and desist.

### You (2025-12-01T14:24:31.108Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Ep. Yeah. Put it on our website. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:25:01.665Z)

I'm going to need a lot of help with Sherben, though, because if we want to take advantage of Sherben's help, Let me. You've met him a few times. He's intellectually very. He's very, very smart person. And he loves to try to. Like, when, when there's something he wants to learn about, he goes all in. Like, he grabs a hold of the problem. He iterates, he learns he's very good. But in the probably 10 hours over the past week that I spent with him on this, to try to get his help. Let me see if I can boil it down. He is still willing and wants to invest in us up to 50 to 60 thousand dollars. He wants the same percentage share of the company that you and Vinod have. Which is something I have a real problem with because he's. One moment he scolds me for how I divvy the company up 20, 20, 20, 20, 20. And then the next moment, he wants the exact same thing. And so I'm having. I'm personally having a little bit of resentment that. I have a friend that is overreaching in this moment. Right, but. I. We may need his money. So he keeps jumping to like, well, you guys will need to settle. And the settlement could up be 25,000 for Drew and 25,000 for Mark. I don't think we should give them anything close to that. Like, I feel like you should get honest and God reimbursed. The costs. His out of pocket cost with a very generous interest rate or some sort of multiple kind of concept. I don't want them to even be part of our. I don't even want to offer equity to Drew, like, to me. Markets, nothing. Like, I would really love just Mark to get nothing, but that might not be a real world scenario because we might just have to pay him for his consulting time, right? Drew gets repaid his money, he gets some really generous interest rate or multiple on it. It could be that, you know, one or each of them get a percentage of InnVestAI as an investor. But I think there's risk that they could be part of a competitor for us going forward. And so I don't necessarily want them to be part of our company and even in an investor format. But again, this is for us to talk about, right? I don't understand. I mean, what Sherben is doing is he keeps grasping onto the safe note concept and saying, well, the only asset you have is the 75kC node. So divide it by a fifth, and then, like, that should be what their settlement is, and just. Again. I don't. I mean, I can't tell you how many times Mark told me over the past year.

### You (2025-12-01T14:27:26.548Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:27:53.905Z)

Well, you got to be, you know, like a grown up, Diane. You know the risk. You know the risk. I know this is harsh. You know the risk. I know this is harsh. You know the risk. Right. And so he knew the risk, too, right? He. He contributed his time, and if nothing really came of it, he knew that. Risk, just like he's said to me many times. So where I need help, a sure bend coming back to is there's good and bad, right? The good is he wants to help. And he does want to still be involved as like a fractional gc. You know, his patent experience could be helpful for us. Not at this moment because we don't have something that is patentable, but if we start to work with Mark Woodworth in data and, you know, start to work with an economist using our data, there could be something that is patentable in the future. And so for him to be involved in kind of early in discussions that could, you know, help us think about the product we develop and what, what could be patentable.

### You (2025-12-01T14:28:32.548Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:28:56.065Z)

So there's all good. But I just think, like, we need to think about what we're willing to give him if we want to accept his offer, because his money comes with the ability to pay Drew back immediately. Right. Which is very helpful to us, but some of the strings that he wants are just hard and. Instead of maybe telling you all about it. What I'll send you is some iterations I did early one morning this weekend where I just was trying to work through it mentally, and the iterations were starting to, like, click in. Like, maybe it's not just that Sherbin gets X amount, maybe it gets divided. Like, sure, Ben gets for paying Drew back. You know, if It's. If it's 10,000 or $12,000 or something like that. Drew get. Sherbet gets a certain percentage for that, and then he gets another percentage for work he does that. He does not require a salary for any of it going forward. He's been clear. Right. And so maybe there's another bucket that's like that. But I, I believe there's a solution here. It's just not as simple as Sherbet coming in to save the day, because his, his ask is very far reaching on this. Does that make sense? A little bit what I'm talking about.

### You (2025-12-01T14:30:17.268Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I think I would. One of the things we may want to think about is. Splitting up whatever equity we offer him. Number one, it would be non voting. But we could separate. His legal services equity from his investment equity. And the legal services would be dependent upon him continuing. As, you know, and not just for a year or two and then drop out. So, you know, we could, like, go with a vesting solution or something, you know, over. Five years or something like that. You know, whether. You know, we haven't even talked about how the three of us are going to split it out. And I'm perfectly fine if you take 51 and, you know, I split 49, that way you don't have to worry about the two of us. Like I said. I mean, I can. I can promise you we would never do a Mark and Drew attempted to do. But you know. For peace of mind, if that helps. That's. That's fine.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:31:33.665Z)

Yes, I do need the pizza. And, and I know you wouldn't, but, like, I just, like, I, I. And I just don't know that it, it's fundraiseable. Right? Like, I think we need to be able to show the world that there is a structure in place where who can't? Happen because we thought through it. But yes. And so you understand, what Sherburn wants is he wants to come along, and if you. And, and if this case, you and the Note are the 49% and you break that into, you know, equal parts, he wants to be equal with you guys. And that's where I just feel like that's, like, a little too much to ask of him right now.

### You (2025-12-01T14:31:43.428Z)

Right. Yeah. And that's why I think we could split it up into, you know, not three equal parts in the ownership equity, but. You know? Two and a half or whatever. However, we are going to do it as equity. But then. Basically something of equal amount or whatever we want to do it. As a side, which would have, like I said, the vesting period, things like, I mean, there's a lot of different ways we could do it. So one of the things I. I wanted to mention is, you know, spend a lot of time with family over this weekend. Excuse me. And I mentioned I have a brother in law who invests. He sold his business back in 2011 for a very, very. Nice amount. Yeah. It was a European company who wanted to expand their North American presence. And everybody knew that they were paying too much for the company, but they did anyway.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:33:25.985Z)

It was strategic, right? Y.

### You (2025-12-01T14:33:26.948Z)

Yeah, yeah. But. But anyway. I've been speaking to him about this, and he's been kind of mentoring me and giving me some ideas. And I always said that, you know, I'm not going to approach family. For any type of investment. Just in case anything goes south. I don't care. I don't want. Any potential hard feelings. But I always also said if they approach me, And ask to do this, then that's a different story. Which he did this weekend, so. But I'm not going to set up any calls or do anything until this whole thing is subtle.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:34:10.545Z)

Eah.

### You (2025-12-01T14:34:10.628Z)

But. We never talked about the amount. I just know what he's capable of doing, which, I mean, it could be six figures. I don't. You know, we'll see, but. Or it might just be 50k, I don't know.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:34:25.905Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-01T14:34:27.908Z)

But anyway, so. So.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:34:28.625Z)

Which 50k would be helpful to us, too, right now. I mean, we're, we are very lean and so. Well, one thing that Sherburn keeps going back to and I'm, and I'm not okay with this, is he keeps saying just essentially dissolve the company, dissolve the safe note. And I'm. Not like I don't want to dissolve the llc. I don't. I don't want to dissolve the safe note because while the safe note is really, I'm earning it right by trying to work for them part time so that their risk is mitigated.

### You (2025-12-01T14:34:30.468Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:34:59.105Z)

But there's two things. The work I'm going to do for them is technology related, right? It's, I'm, yes, it's asset management, but I am, I'm starting to get involved with like, their technology team and so the more I it they become a customer investor advisor and I can use that relationship to help us. I'm 100 confident of it. But second, it sets precedent that we have a anchor investor at a 5 million free money safe Note valuation. If I've said that correctly, which to me just is the validation is worth I don't want to have to like go dissolve that Safe Note. And so I feel like Sherbet is going down a path, his attorney path. That is like we need to. I need to. Or somehow rein them in and say no. Just focus on the settlement. Right? Just get Drew and get Mark. Paid out of it for the minimal amount. And because, like, I don't want to have to reset up a new bank account. Right? Like, we finally. What I want to do is just get and I'll see agreement, Don, and add you and Vanilla to the bank account. Like, I don't want to have to. Restart over, so. Anyway, that. That's me musing. I just. It was a lot of discussion where he keeps going back to dissolving, dissolving, dissolving. I mean, what is what? Well, maybe you don't have an opinion on it. I don't know. Do you have an opinion on. Dissolving the LLC and things like that versus just trying to work around it.

### You (2025-12-01T14:36:37.508Z)

Not until I hear his reasons why.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:36:40.065Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:36:40.868Z)

But we don't have anything to dissolve. There is no llc. So I I. So when you first bring it up, I'm thinking, well, Basically, you know, what is he suggesting, that we just give the money back to them and they cut a new check to whatever? You know, we've, you and I have spoken about putting together a blanket. Company or an umbrella and have the various. Other entities underneath so we wouldn't have to get rid of the name InnVestAI. It just becomes part of this parent company ISO. You know, if he's thinking about something like that, I think we need to at least hear and hear him out.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:37:21.985Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:37:22.548Z)

And, and, and find out, you know, what is the reason for. And I can't suggest, I can't imagine that he would just say, get the money back. And that's it.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:37:31.265Z)

Well, I mean, the. The money, it's. It's coming monthly at this point, right? And it was. It's coming monthly just because I. I had to have a stop, stop gap solution. But also, Carlos is really busy. Like, If I get 10 minutes of his time in a week, I am incredibly lucky. Right? But. What he's given me is a window into his company where I have those Personas we talk about, right? There's a lender Persona, there's a management company Persona, there's an investor Persona. There are all these Personas that if I do this correctly and I build the right relationships, he's given me the ability to maneuver within his organization. If this makes sense. I. He's given me the free will that I can reach out directly to Ian, who runs the Debt and Structured finance group. I sat next to Ian for two days. Right. I now know Ian enough that I can be like, yeah, you know, or. Any. I now know Prana well enough that I can be like Prana. Let's get on a call and walk through what we have. So I don't want to and I don't want to do anything that disrupts like that customer, investor advisor potential that. That exists there. I don't want to be problematic to Driftwood. I just want to be like quite as a mouse and this is making sense and just get the benefit out of the relationship for us. For. For us.

### You (2025-12-01T14:38:39.668Z)

Got. It.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:38:50.465Z)

And to be able to. Because within. I'm looking at the work they're doing and some of the things they want to do, like, if we could start to build that relationship, I really think they could be using InnVestAI at a minimum for their internal values. Right. Which would hugely speed up for them, the work. That's involved with that would create transparency, because they are trying to create basically like a retail product and the investment space. Right. Which requires very frequent valuations. And so if they had a transparent AI augmented valuation model. Right. They could probably check a lot of boxes and move faster through the. What am I saying? But the like, you know, building out that new retail channel that they're. That they're working on.

### You (2025-12-01T14:39:41.908Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:39:45.585Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:39:47.348Z)

I, I, I agree with that. I mean, we don't want to damage the relationship in any way, shape or form. So I, I, I just kind of wonder if that. If. If why he's bringing that up would be like the nuclear option, right? I don't know. So, I mean, let's. Let's. Let's try to find out his justification for that. But I. I agree. If we can just. Negotiate something and end it that. 's. That is definitely, in my opinion, the. The best option, so.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:40:23.825Z)

And that's even even in what the attorney sent. I I didn't read through the entire thing because I was so stressed when I got it. I read like the first pair paragraph where I was accused of fraud, and I just had to put it aside and not read it the rest of the way. But did say they're very closing statement was that they wanted to reach was leading Howard a settlement. Is what what he said? He said it's the way the letter was written. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-01T14:40:46.308Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah. I. I felt the same thing. The only other thing that's just popped into my mind is I'm wondering if he's. Suggesting something that would be similar to a bankruptcy. That. You know, if we just dissolve, that means we're no longer liable for any. Previous, which really would only be the money that they put in. That's. I don't know. I guess we have to talk to him. I'm. I'm curious about his reasoning, so.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:41:22.785Z)

And remember, he's intellectual, Right? He's an attorney. He's like, he's not a Delaware attorney, which is also something that it may be that he's an attorney. And he actually did a really good job of explaining why people incorporate in Delaware. He said it's because there's a there's the court of law, which every state has a court of law. Delaware has a very specific second court called the Court of equity. It's one of the only states that has that. And so that's why people incorporate in Delaware. But he's not a Delaware incorporation attorney. Right. And so everything I'VE read says until you have an L assigned llc.

### You (2025-12-01T14:41:24.548Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:42:04.385Z)

There. They. It's. It's. That a court would not honor their my verbal commitment to them because we don't have a signed llc. Sherman, though, is presuming that the intent was that we did have assigned llc, and we're trying to settle that out.

### You (2025-12-01T14:42:24.068Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:42:24.225Z)

And so we may need to actually still engage a Delaware attorney, Right. To. So that for minimal services, but so that this can be on his or her letterhead. Right. And it's clear that this is a Delaware corporation specialist, and it might cost us two grand or something like that to do that, but.

### You (2025-12-01T14:42:49.348Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Okay? Well. We'll see what he's got to say tomorrow night. I think that'll be. That'll be fine.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:42:59.025Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:43:00.228Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:43:01.265Z)

He did suggest I respond to the attorney and saying that we're, we're complying with the cease and desist, but I'm really, I don't, I don't sure I'm comfortable writing something like that. I said yes to him, but it's Monday morning and we're. Going to talk tomorrow afternoon, so I just don't know, like I thought, if this is making sense. I'm not sure I want to have any correspondence with the attorney until the four of us have a discussion, and I feel more comfortable in what words to use. Or do you disagree with that? Like, should we. Should we reply? We're in receipt of your letter and, you know, acknowledging receipt and that.

### You (2025-12-01T14:43:42.148Z)

I. I would. I would go ahead and draft something, but have Mike review it. I mean, I don't think we should just draft a reply and shoot it off. And if we make one little mistake in how we. Say something that could be misinterpreted. I wouldn't want to take that risk either. But, you know, maybe. Maybe just having proofread it before we send it off.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:44:07.185Z)

Okay? Okay? I feel like this. I mean, I feel like this can wait till tomorrow at 5:30 just because it's not that long. Of a time. It's two days in the grand scheme of things.

### You (2025-12-01T14:44:15.908Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was nothing in the letter that's specified in any type of that I can remember. Maybe there is. I'd have to go back and double check, but I don't remember saying anything that you have to respond within X number of days or something like that.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:44:32.705Z)

Okay? All right. Okay. So is there anything. I mean, I. Is it all right if we cancel tomorrow's call? Just between you and I? Because we have that call with Mike Skiba, and then we have. On Thursday, we have Jessica and we have Mike Tanner, and, like, so.

### You (2025-12-01T14:44:51.268Z)

Oh. Yeah, no, that's fine. I. I thought. In fact, I thought today's call was to replace tomorrow's call, so. No, that's fine.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:44:57.345Z)

Okay? Just this week. I. I have to go into work at noon and. And work till 8 and then tomorrow's and Thursday are the only two days I have off.

### You (2025-12-01T14:44:58.548Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:45:07.425Z)

Okay. And are you okay? Are you comfortable with what is money is in the bank account? I've tried to do the best that I possibly can. I mean, I know you guys, the language I use isn't great, but. So there's 7,500 in there once the second wire clears, which should be. Some time between today and Wednesday. I don't plan to touch any of that. I have to submit an expense report, so I had to front the travel expenses, which were about 2k. And then that probably I. And. And I just need to, like, do reconciliation right when. When it comes in, but I'm going to. Have Riftwood deposit all future monthly payments into that account directly. Not into me. Not a check. I just. There. They have no problem with that. I just didn't have an actual wiring instructions or any, you know, a transfer number to give them until now and I. I believe we've agreed that it's like. The 15th of every month is when they would pay it. It's in arrears. So I've done consulting work already for one month that we got paid for, and now I'm doing it for the second month so that it's not current. It's in arrears. Right. And the consulting agreement has, has the ability to extend it beyond six months, which I'm really hoping I can, if I do a good job and help them with some of their technology initiatives and have some wins with it internally.

### You (2025-12-01T14:46:06.788Z)

Got it? Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:46:40.625Z)

Then we just keep getting the 12,500. Right. And we. We use this customer as testing ground for our products. And they develop too. Right. So, like my whole concept of Capex, they're an actual developer in addition, so add another user case. Right. Persona to the mix.

### You (2025-12-01T14:46:43.908Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:47:01.025Z)

So I've rambled. But are you comfortable with the fact that the funds are there, the account exists. Any concerns on your part.

### You (2025-12-01T14:47:12.628Z)

No, at a high level I am. But I got to admit that I haven't caught up from everything. Last week I did see. I don't know, I don't remember if there was an email or teams chat or both that came across, but I just skimmed through it. I honestly did not read through it. So I'll take a look at it. But I don't. I can't imagine there'd be anything that I would disagree with.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:47:34.705Z)

Okay? What I want, what I want everyone to feel good about is that they're like, I mean, Mark was going to contribute 7,500, right? So that amount is just sitting there right now with an additional contribution coming in December, on December 15th. And really without Driftwood, he was the false. At this point, he would have been the person we had to look for for funding. And that funding would have come with so many conditions. It would have been dreadful for us. Right. He would have been felt empowered beyond belief if we had actually started to use any dollars in there. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-01T14:48:09.668Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:48:12.625Z)

I do have one question, though, that I do want. I mean, why is it in the conversations you had with Mark Andrew, why was it that Mark never funded anything? Prior like Drew funded every dollar of it. Right. Like Mark didn't fund a penny. Or am I incorrect in that?

### You (2025-12-01T14:48:30.948Z)

I don't know. I actually never did have those conversations. Or didn't. No excuse for it, but I just kind of figured they were working on it. I. Didn't know if Lar had actually. Given Drew the money. Andrew was just managing it. Or if it was all coming out of Drew's first. And then they would go to my, you know. No clue. I have no idea.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:49:03.985Z)

Because if I'm understanding this right, like, I can see, Drew gave us basically, from his QuickBooks or whatever, every expense that he paid, which were like the Amazon hosting and. And the attorney costs and. Right. And then the 1400amonth for the software engineering. And if you add all of that up, it's probably about 7,500 is what assumption I'm working on. And then starting in December, then it was we were going to start to dip into mark 7500 plus then the driftwood contribution. But in my mind, we're paying back, Drew. And Mark hasn't contributed. Any true dollar amount. But I guess that'll we'll learn when we go to talk settlement terms with them, if that's actually the case.

### You (2025-12-01T14:49:56.868Z)

Yeah. I'm going to pull up that budget spreadsheet that. That you always used, because I know he did have a. Row up above in terms of.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:50:10.225Z)

Contributions, right?

### You (2025-12-01T14:50:11.108Z)

Contributions. Yeah. So. Okay, yeah, let me pull that up. And see. But yeah, I, I, we never did have any specific conversations as to who was contributing what. I just knew that they had both. Basically, they both agreed to put in some money at the, the very beginning to cover these costs, and then, you know, what, what was done with it or anything else, so. So monthly raised in July15000. But it doesn't say who put it what. In. In the spreadsheet. So it just shows July 25. July of 25. 15,000. And then in November, the 75, 000 safe note. So that's the only thing that I am aware of that I've been using this spreadsheet for everything, so.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:51:05.825Z)

Let me. Hold on. Let me just send you something really quick. Because I just don't know if it's the same one. Just give me one second. To. Save it. One.

### You (2025-12-01T14:51:41.348Z)

Looking on the sources and.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:51:48.385Z)

Oh, is that me?

### You (2025-12-01T14:51:55.268Z)

So I do see on the sources and uses tab. It shows through November. Drew with 7,500. And then Mark in the second column. With 7,500. And in that column under Mark. Is all zeros. So this does kind of show. And then. So. So Drew looks like he's got two columns in the spreadsheet. One for him, one for Mark. And then there's a third column for the safe note. And under his he's showing a total monthly cost or total cost of 8875.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:52:45.665Z)

8875 okay.

### You (2025-12-01T14:52:47.828Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So I'd have to go through here and double check, but.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:52:51.425Z)

Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-12-01T14:52:53.668Z)

Yeah, so.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:52:54.225Z)

Well, that's not all right.

### You (2025-12-01T14:52:56.068Z)

No. So. So. Collateral 370. Oh, that was carrie. 3,000 for cloud hosting. 4,000 altogether for offshore. Yeah. So basically, all the inputs that he has there are all correct. So accounting services are legal. Of 1,500. I don't remember what that was. Was there some type of.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:53:27.745Z)

I think it was for his attorney to give him the initial draft of the LLC and then maybe some early things. He for the. Yeah. Was his attorney in the llc?

### You (2025-12-01T14:53:29.588Z)

His attorney. Yeah, okay. Okay? O. Kay. All right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:53:38.625Z)

So, like, and they had said 5%, it's under 6% was the interest rate that was used in that budget. Which is why if we go to something like a 20% interest rate. Right? Like, that is a, I mean, to me, it's a generous interest rate return or some other research I did said, just do a multiple on it. Like, you know, like a one, five or two multiple. I feel like that's starting to get too expensive, but. And I'm not, you know, I don't know how we settle with Mark because Mark made no true financial contributions.

### You (2025-12-01T14:53:46.788Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:54:15.905Z)

He may argue like the Phoenix trip. Right. But in fairness, he was going to Phoenix already. Right? He, he didn't go to Phoenix to invest, to represent InnVestAI. He was going to Phoenix. And it just so happened he was on a panel, Right. Talking about technology. So.

### You (2025-12-01T14:54:15.988Z)

Right. Yeah. Y. Eah. Right. Y.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:54:36.945Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:54:37.988Z)

So I am not going to. Make any changes or anything to this spreadsheet because I don't want to show last. Modified by me. Because right now it's. It is showing. Last modified by Drew. November 24th. So I don't want anybody to come in and say, oh, Mark did have these expenses or whatever. I'm leaving it as it is. But right. There it is. I mean, that's basically in Drew's handwriting. That you know he contributed. This mark is zero. And then we've got the. The safe note. So okay.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:55:20.465Z)

Jew contributed, let's just call it $9,000. And we very leanly lived on that for a period of time. Then we need to, like, start getting you paid, too. Like, that is, like, a high priority. And I hope. One thing I think the three of us are going to be need to be in agreement on is we do need a couple of investors earlier on to help us financially survive. Right. And so if that's Sherman, if it's, I do believe in my ability to go into the women's network. Right. And raise money, but I need materials to do it, and I don't have the materials I need right now. But so that you can start to have money you need to live on so you can pay for your expenses. And I'm sure it's tense between you and your wife and your kid, your daughter's. Tires and your wife's tires and all of that. And that the node starts to get some compensation, even if it's not full time. Right, because he's still working part time, but that he's getting some economic.

### You (2025-12-01T14:55:45.588Z)

Right. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:56:23.985Z)

Compensation for putting in that late night hours that he's putting in.

### You (2025-12-01T14:56:28.068Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:56:29.665Z)

Or do you agree? Are you in agreement on that?

### You (2025-12-01T14:56:31.668Z)

Yeah. Yeah, no, I think that that's. That's fine.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:56:32.705Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:56:36.148Z)

I mean. Well, for. For my part, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. The only thing that I would say. And we do need to get. The LLC done asap once we kind of, you know, will let Mike advise as to what order we should be doing these things, but, you know, I don't want to get caught up in the same situation that we had before where. Let's get that done.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:57:00.625Z)

Yeah, me too.

### You (2025-12-01T14:57:04.228Z)

Let's keep modifications. To a minimum. You know, if there's a couple things that we need to. To agree, but, you know, if we structure, you know, one thing we wanted to think about is, you know, when it comes down to voting, is it three equal votes or are we going to go by equity, you know? So if you have the majority of equity, then there's no need to vote on anything.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:57:30.465Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-12-01T14:57:31.268Z)

I mean, well, those. Those are the things we need to figure out, you know, and there's a couple other things. Like, you know, I always disagreed with that clause in there. That founders could have outside work, even if it competes with us, which I, you know, if that's in the template, I would, you know, that's the kind of thing I'd want to leave out, but, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:57:49.425Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-01T14:57:52.228Z)

Let's just. Yeah. Let's just try to get this done, yeah?

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:57:54.705Z)

Yeah, no, I'm good to sign. Like, yes, I'm good to get the. And I think maybe Jessica, I mean, Sherman, can advise us on some of this, but this may go more to, like, Jessica. Like, in a. Jessica can't. Who does Jessica know that could help us figure out the right way to structure? It. Because the other thing that I just. I see concern around is we need a generous pool for employees, right? Because we're going to need to hire people at some point within the next year to help us. Like you said, SaaS sales. Right. Like, we're going to need someone there. There's other roles. We're going to need and those roles, because there's nothing to offer, really. They're going to. We're going to have to give some equity. Right. Like you've been telling me, like. And so I don't know that we've really thought through. Is that pool big enough for the. Talent that we're going to need.

### You (2025-12-01T14:58:31.348Z)

Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:58:49.425Z)

And it's going to come from both of us. It's going to come from all three of us, right? But making sure that. That that piece is thought out in advance so we're all aligned on it is important to me as well.

### You (2025-12-01T14:59:00.468Z)

Yeah, no, I agree. I agree. Yeah, those are the things I would really like to, you know. At least set the groundwork on. You know, as quickly as you can, so, okay.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:59:11.905Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T14:59:12.708Z)

I think we're. I think we're okay.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:59:13.105Z)

And I'm good. I mean, we can sign the llc. I mean, I would say if we were in a better position, like, we had Jessica's advice and mar. Like, I would sign tomorrow. So it's. I want you to know it's not that. It's not that, right?

### You (2025-12-01T14:59:23.588Z)

Yeah, no, I. No, I understand. Right. I completely understand. So. And I agree. Yeah. I want to get some input from somebody who's been there. I mean. We've got three people here who know the real estate industry like the back of their hand, but when it comes to starting a SaaS company, Yeah, it's. I mean, I've been in SaaS for 15 years, but I haven't started anything. I haven't been on the, you know, from day one. So, you know, we need somebody who can help us out with that.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:59:47.905Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-01T14:59:54.308Z)

Type of work, so.

### Guest (2025-12-01T14:59:56.625Z)

And that's not true. Or Mark. Right. Because they felt like they were experts in the matter.

### You (2025-12-01T14:59:58.628Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:00:01.425Z)

But their expertise just is so painful to deal with.

### You (2025-12-01T15:00:01.588Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:00:07.505Z)

Okay, so we have a plan. I'll Cancel Tomorrow at 10. The first call we have is with Mike Skiba again. He's. He's who I see as like the Howard of Capex. Right? Like he knows Capex inside and out, but he's trying to do his own thing at the at. The same time. I. I've spent quite a bit of time with him and I really love his, like, he. 's brave. He reaches out to people and makes connections. He reached out to me, a blind. LinkedIn outreach. That's how I met him. And it was because I was at Portman and he was a Rabbit. Right. And so Rabbit would have been software that Portman should use. We ultimately didn't. And he has a lot of feedback on why Rabbit didn't make it. But I really, really like him. And so it was kind of like. Like, if you like him, there's a little bit of courting that's going to go on here, right? Like, how might we work together? You know, what could we build things like that?

### You (2025-12-01T15:01:10.548Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm. I'm all for it. I mean. I've said this before, my. I came into this knowing that that equity pool is going to shrink because we have to bring people in. And that's why I was thinking I'm going to have 20%. But 20% of what? It could be, you know, 20% of a pretty small, small sliver. So I am fully prepared and expecting to be able to.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:01:38.465Z)

Right.

### You (2025-12-01T15:01:47.028Z)

Or will have to, you know, hand out equity or do some type of a, you know, some type of a sharing deal with these people, so. I'm perfectly fine with that. And I think the notice too. I think he understands. That, you know, it's not 20% of everything. We'll go from there. So. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:02:06.705Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-01T15:02:07.028Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:02:08.225Z)

All right, then we will Talk tomorrow at 10:30 with Mike Skiba is the next one. And then tomorrow night with Mike. All these mics with Mike Sherben at 5:30.

### You (2025-12-01T15:02:13.268Z)

Okay? Yep. Y. Eah, yeah. Okay? So it's good.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:02:20.225Z)

All right. Thanks, Howard.

### You (2025-12-01T15:02:21.188Z)

Okay? All right. See ya.

### Guest (2025-12-01T15:02:23.185Z)

Hi.
