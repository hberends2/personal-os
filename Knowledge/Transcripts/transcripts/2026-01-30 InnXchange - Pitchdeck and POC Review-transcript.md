# Transcript for: InnXchange - Pitchdeck and POC Review

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:04:13.302Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2026-01-30T14:04:15.305Z)

Good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:04:17.942Z)

Good. I'm just. I'm running one minute late because I'm having a problem with outlook, so I just dialed in from my phone really quick while I tried to figure out how to. Fix my outlook issue. How are you today?

### You (2026-01-30T14:04:30.585Z)

I'm doing all right. Trying to keep warm.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:04:36.022Z)

Yes. Yes. I mean, I know it's way it doesn't even compare to Georgia, but it's been cold here too.

### You (2026-01-30T14:04:41.465Z)

Yeah. No, I know. Did you get all the ice?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:04:48.902Z)

Yes, we got all the ice.

### You (2026-01-30T14:04:49.385Z)

Digit. Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:04:52.502Z)

Pretty last Sunday was. A lot of things closed last Sunday. A lot of things closed last Saturday night. And then they reopened on Monday.

### You (2026-01-30T14:05:03.785Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:05:06.582Z)

And are you at the cabin or are you at home? At. Home.

### You (2026-01-30T14:05:12.185Z)

Y. Eah. The cottage only has. Electric baseboard heat. And it's not large. Not large enough to keep up. Even if it's in the 30s or 40s, it struggles to stay warm in there.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:05:23.382Z)

Got. It.

### You (2026-01-30T14:05:29.785Z)

At this point. It's pretty much just winterized and shut down.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:05:40.982Z)

Happening with my. This is the craziest thing happening. Okay, so open up the link. Add this device transfer to this advice how would you like to join on this? I guess I want to add with this device. Okay? Now opening it up from my computer. I'm on, but I'm on speaker, so let me. Take out my note taker, and then we'll be ready to start. Another. Okay? And let me just take my note taker out. Okay? So the two things I wanted to go over. Well, we have a call on February 3, which is Tuesday, with Sloan Dean. This is just kind of a networking call. I'm not particularly asking him anything that to give me thought and, like, who else I should be or who else we should be talking to in the industry to try to figure out our next couple of steps. Right. Like why this came up is I went back, let me go. Back a little bit further is Sloan and I know each other from work we did on Marriott Advisor and Owner advisory committee about 15 years ago. We were on the same committee. That's how I got to know him. He's very unique in that he comes up from the op side of the business in revenue management. Which is very. I mean, revenue managers tend to just stay in their lane. But he then transitioned into a business development role. So he got exposure to capital markets. And then he went on to run Remington Hotels, which is owned by Ashford. And he was there for 17 years. He laughed last year. I don't know all the stories or particulars about it. But why it kind of came up to me, came to mind is Carlos Jr. And I were talking a couple months ago about people who would be really great to run their operations division, people who are thinking about technology. And I mentioned Sloan, and he said really great things about Sloan. I hadn't thought about Salon in a long time. I had tried to reach out to him a couple times over the past year, but I tried one more time to reach out to him before the holidays, and the call kept getting pushed and pushed and pushed, but we finally had it. And talked for about an hour. He's making a move into a technology role or company as well, but I don't think he can talk about it yet. I think he's founding a company. It's on the operation side, it's not on the capital market side. But he knows all the technology forward thinking leaders in the industry if this is making sense. Right. He's kind of networked in with the type of people we want to be networking with. Maybe he could be an investor as well. I don't know. I mean. I went back in January and I listened to all of his podcasts that were he has a podcast called Not Done yet. And I went back January, listened to all the podcasts that were with technology leaders in the industry. Those all grade. There was one in particular that I'd like an introduction to, and his name is Ben Rafter. He's at Hotel Equities, I think the CEO, and he is actually a startup guy. By background. He's, I think. He's started and exited and had success with two startups. And then he kind of moved into a company called Springboard, and they were acquired by Hotel equities, and then they put him up to the CEO role. So if nothing else, I just want Sloan to come away with, like, this is a valid idea. And he will not be embarrassed. Introducing me to Ben Rafter, Austa Ben Rafter. Does that make sense? Like, because Ben Raptor is an actual startup guy and he also is a hotel investment leader. And what I want to get out of this is, well, we need to talk about it amongst ourselves. Like, how do we do this reboot, we're going to need software engineers. We're going to need, like, we're going to need to figure some of this out, and it would be good to dialogue with someone who might have some perspective on it that could help us.

### You (2026-01-30T14:10:52.825Z)

Makes sense.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:10:53.062Z)

So I told right we would have that we'd go over the pitch deck and the POC with him. And so let's start there. Did you get the version of the pitch deck that I sent a day or two ago?

### You (2026-01-30T14:11:08.185Z)

No, I haven't seen any pitch deck.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:11:11.302Z)

Okay, then let me show you the pitch deck. I thought that might be the case because my uncle didn't respond either. The next step for me, outside of you giving constructive feedback. I mean, I guess Sherban can give feedback, too, but he doesn't really understand this that well. Can you see my screen now?

### You (2026-01-30T14:11:35.545Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:11:37.862Z)

Okay? I did this in Pop AI. I did not at all look at what Drew. I just didn't even touch what Drew and Mark put together right. So I did this completely from scratch. All of this is changeable. It can be a completely different theme. I mean, whatever. I was just really trying to get the content and. Figure out how to use Pop AI as well. So basically, our name. I took the wording the AI powered operating system directly from DealPath. That's what DealPath calls itself. So I just put it for hotel real estate investments, and then one summary page that I tried to make the point that we need one integrated system. We're a decade behind everyone else. I took the 57.4 billion global number directly from jail. It's the transaction volume that was done in. I think it was 2024, because the 2025 numbers aren't ready yet. It's really a bigger industry than that, if you think about it. But it's too hard to explain if I try to bifurcate it and build it up a different way. I thought this was just the simplest way to just show a number where I can tie it back to a report. And then I try to say, and I just try to stay up front, we are going to be a deal path plus a RedIQ plus parent view. That's what you know. And so it's pipeline management, AI, augmented underwriting and equity and debt.

### You (2026-01-30T14:13:18.185Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:13:20.502Z)

Asset management.

### You (2026-01-30T14:13:21.625Z)

This all sounded like nitpicking, but rediq. Rediq is a lowercase r.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:13:25.622Z)

No, go ahead. Oh, no, no. Great. That's perfect.

### You (2026-01-30T14:13:33.145Z)

Just in case anybody's familiar with that.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:13:33.782Z)

Let me start to make. Well. Yeah, okay. Hold on, Let me just change. All. Reference. Of red. Iq, right? To be a lower. Case. Okay? So. Oh, maybe I could. Well, I had a guy that I used. And maybe I should show you that really quick. Give me one more second because I think you'll understand. Like what I use to build this. Stack. Out. Yes. Okay. So there's some. There's a person who posts on LinkedIn all the time about startups, and this was his suggestion as to how to build a pitch deck, so I used it almost exactly. You start with a hook slide. A problem. Clarity the solution, the market size. The demo. This I don't have, because this we're going to need to work on together. Timing, business model, traction, proof. Like, I pretty much used this to the best I could to build this pitch deck. So that's just. I just want you to see that in the background. That's like the help that I used in structuring it. So my uncle helped me before I put this into PowerPoint. He helped me a little bit with, like, the words that resonate the most from a marketing perspective. So the idea that 25% of our time is doing nothing but manipulating data, I actually have a report that backs that up. So I have source data for it. It's true that solutions exist in other property types, but not hotels. Right? And our data doesn't fit. And then I tried to say that it's the flywheel. We're all doing the same work. But my uncle really thought what would resonate was if we said, you look at hundreds of deals just to close a handful. He thought that that would resonate with the reader. As far as the volume of work. That people do. So that's included in here. Then the solution is basically us, right? And I tried to say that. It's proven, like in other real estate asset classes, this is proven. They're financially, they're monetizing, Customers love them. So we have like market evidence that solutions like this work, that we, that we have the domain expertise and that it's a very tight knit industry. Right. Everybody knows everybody and that includes globally as well. When it's all said and done. Sorry. They're doing the yard outside, so it's loud. And again, this is just like all of this could be changed. I'm just happy to get it in, at least a first draft done right, because I couldn't even get that far. With mark and drew. So then I took to try to show the traction, I just took three quotes, one from. Dealpath, one from RedIQ and one from Paraview, just to try to show how they have helped their customers. And on the Rediq one, I did find a quote in one of the Rediq case studies. I mean, you could tell me if this is true or not, but I just took it directly from one of their case studies. That JLL cut their underwriting time in half with rediq. So is that. Does that feel okay to you? Okay? Okay? Now, this doesn't come up great in Pop AI, but it looks better in PowerPoint. It says why can't fieldpath? And you just can't see deal path here. I need to figure out how to fix that. But why can't deal path just create a hotel module? And so I tried to basically say that these platforms are great with. Four major food groups. But we don't have standardized rent rules. We need market analysis, modeling. Our operators track record drives 20 to 40% of value. Our capital structure is complex. So? So it's just like. It's just too different. And then what I'm struggling with, and maybe you could think about this, is the whole Claude. Anthropic clawed Excel announcement. Like, what does that do to the world, you know? Like, what does that even do to our thesis on the underwriting model? Like, it kind of feels like people will want to stick with their Excel models, but I feel like we should somehow acknowledge it and try to paint a positive view. Of it. I just don't know that I'm educated enough to form that view.

### You (2026-01-30T14:20:05.465Z)

Right off the cuff. Yeah. It will potentially impact the underwriting portion, where they can continue to use their models like they always have. But it's not going to help them with Pipeline, with. Any third party data. Or anything like that. I mean, it's just. It'll help them with the formulas in the spreadsheet. That's about it.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:20:40.422Z)

And then will we be just, like, pulling the underwriting in and out, in and out, in and out. Is that how it will work? Because I'm sure everyone's going to want to use this.

### You (2026-01-30T14:20:48.425Z)

Go in. We still want to avoid that. Yeah, if they really insist on using their own model. Rediq. Really is dependent on Excel. They're. Online underwriting tool. Is built on old technology, and it's virtually worthless. If you use RedIQ, you're either using their Excel model or the plugin. So they can use their own Excel. I don't have a problem with us creating. In exchange Excel based underwriting model. It could be exactly like what we're doing. Right now with the online version. And if we do something like that, then we can control the flow of the data. So that when they work in Excel, whatever changes they make will be reflected in our data. Using a plugin. That's a black hole. That. Is where we don't get the data back.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:22:11.142Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:22:13.305Z)

Unless it gets very complicated.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:22:14.742Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:22:19.545Z)

We don't need to rule out Excel. And I think this whole cloud thing might actually make it easier to get that going. But then again, remember, the underwriting portion is just our foot in the door. So.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:22:34.342Z)

Right.

### You (2026-01-30T14:22:35.225Z)

The other item.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:22:35.302Z)

Right.

### You (2026-01-30T14:22:35.785Z)

S that we're doing the data extraction. I mean. Claude does not help with data extraction. Per se.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:22:47.542Z)

Are we sure of that? Like, have we.

### You (2026-01-30T14:22:47.785Z)

It's still. It can do it, but it's not that great. It takes a little bit of work. People will think that they can just. Upload a spreadsheet to Claude. Or OpenAI or any of those models and expect the data to be magically extracted. Well. It's not. And even if it is extracted doesn't mean that it's going to be mapped to the right place. All it's going to be doing is taking the data out and putting it in a table that matches whatever source it's taking the data out of. So that's what we want to emphasize. And then the fact that when we extract that data, we have that data. Anonymized database where we can then start making. And. Providing market data. And market advice and guidance, which is Excel can't do that.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:23:47.062Z)

Right. So what did I say here? I because I didn't even know what I was talking about, but I felt it would be silly not to because it's just such big news, right, that our underwriting approach takes proven data standardization principles from platforms. And I know I'm exaggerating a bit when I say some of this, but like you're from rediq and you're the validation that you know that this all works. So proven data standardization principles from platforms like rediq and modernizes them for hotels and a Claude and Excel World Hotel P L schemes plus benchmarking that work across Excel, Claude and Native in exchange views. If there's a better way to say that I'm all for it, I. But I don't. Like. I don't know that I'm. I could write anything better than what I wrote. So if you think. If you want to think about it, and. And if there's a bullet point that. What? Because just. What I'm trying to say is, look, we are totally up to speed on everything that's going. Not, you know, maybe not everything, but we're really up to speed on the rate. Of change. And Excel is, you know, this is a big, you know, new, exciting thing with Claude and Excel. And it'll be, you know, we will figure it out, right? We will figure it out to everyone's best advantage.

### You (2026-01-30T14:25:21.145Z)

I would be wary of putting that in a pitch deck.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:25:25.942Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:25:26.665Z)

Let's not draw attention. To something that. Is number one. It's brand new. And number two. Isn't really a direct threat.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:25:43.382Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:25:43.865Z)

For the same reasons I mentioned. It's like, yeah, people are on Excel. Today. That. Claude is only going to help those people who refuse to. Use anything other than their Excel model. That's not what we're selling. We're not selling an Excel replacement. So. I'm just a little leery about even mentioning that in there.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:26:06.262Z)

On page. All right, I'll just take it out.

### You (2026-01-30T14:26:19.785Z)

If we were to reword it. Saying something along those lines that we acknowledge that there have been. I wouldn't even mention Claude in particular, but advances. In excel integration or AI integration in excel. But that is not. Our. Target. That we provide. The real value we provide is over and above just a new underwriting. Model.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:27:03.542Z)

So that's removed. All right, so this didn't clip in as well. I need to work on figuring out how to get this to clip in better. But this is where I got the market sizing. And it's as simple as the transaction volume in the United States and globally. And again, the market size is actually bigger than this because it doesn't really cover all the au, the institutional aum, if that makes sense. Right. It's just transactions. But I feel like it's big enough. That if I just keep this message simple and say, you know, Does that number? It's 50.5. How did. I've got to go back and correct that. What happened here? Oh, I must have clipped in the wrong chart. Because there's one that has 24 volume and this one has 23 volume. I saw Fix that. But the 24 volume is 57.4 and then you can see it peaked in 2015 at 97.9. So the story here is we've, we've been working kind of with very low transaction volumes because of interest rates. And that will likely change going forward. Like, we're probably ready for another spike up because of hold periods, you know, funds needing to divest, things like that. But again, I just thought this was the simplest way to try to explain that it's a very. Even though it's a small asset class, it's still a really big opportunity. Okay? Then I guess what I'm doing here is I'm still trying to show that this is the market size, right? So I restate the 57.3. And then this is straight from JLL, they said. Growing 15 to 25% to 72. Bill in 2025. I have to go back because. I don't know, it was a. 25 report, but 25 numbers weren't finalized, so I need. To fix that language. But that it represents 6% of total global CRE transactions. It's growing three to four times faster than other traditional real estate. It's. I guess I'm saying the same thing when I say outpatient, office, industrial and retail segments. I could remove that. And JLL projects it to reach 178 billion by2034. So all I'm trying to do here is show how big the industry is. And then what was I doing in the next one? First time. Oh, I remember. This is now from I'm saying that first time hotel investors accounted for 16% of the 24 global volume that new capital entering hospitality needs education, workflows and infrastructure. Traditional platforms don't solve the hotel problem. Cross border hotel investment grew 54% year over year. So it shows institutional capital seeking global platforms. And then I just broke out the geographic concentration between North America. EMEA and apac. So this slide might be too busy and I need to fix a few things. My goal is just, again, to try to show that this is a sizable growing sector. Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:31:03.785Z)

One thing I notice here, this is just a layout issue, is you've got a lot of empty space at the bottom of that slide.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:31:13.222Z)

Y.

### You (2026-01-30T14:31:13.305Z)

So if you increase the font size, because they are kind of small. As I'm sitting here representing it on the screen.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:31:21.062Z)

Eah.

### You (2026-01-30T14:31:22.425Z)

You've got a lot of room to increase the font size on that.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:31:28.182Z)

Got it. I'm still getting used to pop AI. It's better than PowerPoint, but I haven't quite mastered the like. If you don't. If you. You can use their AI, like, you know, choose an AI slide layout, but if it doesn't look good, I haven't mastered getting it back to. The way it was.

### You (2026-01-30T14:31:44.985Z)

Yeah. I've. Heard a lot of those are that way. It's like you have to almost accept what it gives you. And can't really fix it very easily.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:31:57.222Z)

That is what I found. Okay, so I needed a slide on, like, gtm, and so I just. Here. I tried to explain the. Like, the flywheel. And again. And I know I'm rambling, Howard, but I really hope my uncle can help me. To put this into a, you know, like a tighter format. I'm just happy. I tried to get the numbers and everything like that into one place, but here's the flywheel, right? And we talk about the network effect. So there might be too much data here or too much, too many words here. But the one thing I do like is the last bullet point, which is switching costs rise as the ecosystem deepens, right? That is true. Like the more customers we get, if we do well, then the switching costs. Are to our benefit if we to try to keep customers. Okay, why now is basically AI Is made this possible and maybe I'll take out the Claude. Statement again here, but. And then. Then I added this. Last night I was going back through some deal path videos and. Dealpath has a. It's one of the modules. I can't remember the name, but they get listings directly from JLL and cbre, like, you know, piped into their platform from the Brokers. And so I think that would help us in that those, those lot, those big firms are already accustomed to doing something like that. And sure, they're piping that into deal path for hotels. Right? And that's great. But it's only to the point where none of the data makes sense because it's the data is so different. And dealpath doesn't really care about hotels, Right. So they're not going to put a lot of effort into creating a module that works for hospitality. So but the precedent aside, and so if we went to jail and cbre inside, we have the deal path for hotels. What I'm hoping for, it's not the first time that they've. Thought about or agreed to pipe their data into a third party system like all their deals, right? So that's why I say that. And the very bottom.

### You (2026-01-30T14:34:39.545Z)

One thing that just occurred to me is this whole thing about Claude.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:34:42.742Z)

Yep.

### You (2026-01-30T14:34:46.825Z)

It's not just Claude. Claude is just the one that got all the headlines when they did the excellent. There have been a lot of AI Excel integrations. Probably the most. One of the better ones came out almost a year ago. So if we want to put something in there, let's not refer to it as Claude, because that sounds like Kleenex, right? Kleenex is just a brand of tissue, and there's a thousand different tissues out there.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:35:19.302Z)

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep.

### You (2026-01-30T14:35:27.065Z)

It might help. So if we do keep anything in there regarding Excel, let's just make it kind of like an Excel AI integration or something like that. Along those lines.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:35:42.102Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:35:42.265Z)

Because what scares me as well is. Claude. Is a very well funded company. They have billions of dollars. And if we keep bringing attention to them, they're going like, well, why doesn't anthropic just go ahead and do they write?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:35:53.302Z)

Right. Right? I mean, I think that's the point. We're going to get up against, like. Well, why can't General AI just do this? Why? You know, why do you actually need a dedicated platform?

### You (2026-01-30T14:36:06.825Z)

Yeah y. Eah. And the answer is they can. But that's they can only do one piece of the pie.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:36:11.542Z)

Okay, so now.

### You (2026-01-30T14:36:18.185Z)

That's why we don't want to come across as.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:36:18.342Z)

Right.

### You (2026-01-30T14:36:22.025Z)

Being afraid of it. But it's a threat. It's not.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:36:28.422Z)

Right. It's an opportunity. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-30T14:36:31.225Z)

Just as much of an opportunity for us. Too, that we can integrate that through that type of.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:36:35.542Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2026-01-30T14:36:37.785Z)

Technology, entire platform.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:36:40.982Z)

Yes, I agree with that. Okay, so I did build up. Some ARR numbers. And I went about it two ways. There's like, there's option A, option B. In the end, it'll be however it is, right? But the idea of trying to go get Lighthouse clients that work with us on the MVP right to iterate. And so I basically, in my mind, said, no revenue until month nine. I mean, let's just go out and find these, you know, three customers, right? That are our lighthouse customers. Driftwood will be one. And then I'm hoping hotel equities might be a second because of this. If I. If we get introduced to Ben Rafter, right? And he likes the idea, maybe they'd be ready to test it again. I can go back to Peachtree. There's a few others that I want to talk to. But three customers by month, nine and six users each. Totally. This is kind of totally made up. The pricing per user is 14k per user per year. And then that we grow from three, and then by month 18, we have 10 customers. And what did I do about the module? Oh, the module adoption is the next module that we. Because, like you said, underwriting is just the foot in the door. Right? I really want to go after the CAPEX module, the PIP module, because no one will have anything like that and it would be incredibly valuable to the industry. But, I mean, that's all my 120k, so it's not like it's, you know, I mean, these are small numbers to begin with, right? So I'm just saying that by month nine, it's 252k, and by month 12, it's 435. K and by month 18, it's 960k. It's totally made up. I don't. I don't know how else to do this slide, but let me show you the other way, which is.

### You (2026-01-30T14:39:00.745Z)

I understand the numbers are made up, but we're going to be asked to justify those numbers. So, I mean, I would treat those right now as placeholders.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:39:08.502Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:39:12.185Z)

But, yeah, they're going to ask about. How many customers is it going to take to get their 3? Well, how was 3 generate 250,000 in revenue? Right. That's a lot of money. For three clients to play.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:39:28.502Z)

I think it's six users. It's six users per customer.

### You (2026-01-30T14:39:34.185Z)

Right? So, yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:39:35.782Z)

Let me just. At 14k.

### You (2026-01-30T14:39:37.305Z)

I wouldn't put it in the deck. But I would be prepared to defend it.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:39:50.262Z)

Right. So three customers that have six users each, and each user is charged $14,000 a year. That's how you get to 252k.

### You (2026-01-30T14:40:03.385Z)

Go. Great. So. Yeah, like I said, I don't know that we need to put the mass in here. But like I said, somebody's going to be looking at the stack and they're going to say, how did you come up with that number? And you're going to have to have the answer.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:40:18.262Z)

Right? And then I'm sure if I do it, ten customers. Ten customers times six users.

### You (2026-01-30T14:40:25.705Z)

Now the next question is, how did you get the six users?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:40:26.742Z)

Times. I used AI to help me. I mean, I feel like. And then I'm just trying to think about my understanding of what it. What a deal team looks like, right? Look at. Someone like is it to go ahead?

### You (2026-01-30T14:40:48.345Z)

I want to bring that up because I've been talking to Archer. And they're major investors, Marcus and Milljap. And they have data from their client base and their average is four users. Right.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:41:06.502Z)

Four users, okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:41:07.705Z)

But that doesn't mean that's the industry standard.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:41:09.862Z)

I can do that. I can make that change. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-30T14:41:11.865Z)

But I also think that's kind of in line with rediq, because you're going to. Have a lot of. Small and mid size clients that may only have one or two users. Hopefully you'll have some institutional that may have six or eight, but I think the average probably.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:41:26.822Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:41:32.505Z)

Would be a little bit closer to four.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:41:37.222Z)

I'm happy to make that change. It'll take those numbers down a little bit.

### You (2026-01-30T14:41:38.425Z)

Again to be unconseconative side under promise and over deliver.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:41:42.742Z)

Okay? So it'll take those numbers down a little bit. But is that. Because I really feel like we just spend a year with our heads down with three Lighthouse clients, right? Like, just trying to create what they need. And once we get to that point and we have a product that is tested with those Lighthouse clients enough, then. We can really, you know, push much more into the monetization. That's in my. That's how I think about it in my mind. Right. Which is why I push.

### You (2026-01-30T14:42:17.225Z)

Yeah. No. Sign out. In fact, I would suggest maybe adding a fourth row and take it out to 24 months.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:42:26.102Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:42:29.065Z)

Basically they're going to say, at what point will you hit a million dollar ARR? And you're almost there in six months. So if you had another six months on top of that to 24, you'll show. Maybe we get up to 1.5 or something, I don't know.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:42:35.542Z)

Okay? Okay? And then the second way to potentially get there is to land an enterprise account, like a JLL or cbre, right? And I did again. I pushed it out to nine months. 30 users within like one of those major enterprise account at 20k per user is 500 in ARR. So the math is different on the amount, right? I think I was really going more for 500. Just feels like a nice even kind of like, okay, you know, we're, you know, we're going to ask CBRE for 500k and we, you know, staff their capital markets and they have a lot of capital markets analysts and they have a lot of appraisal, appraisers and appraiser analysts. And then you also have a few small and medium sized businesses. Right. So that's. There's a little bit of revenue layered in from that. And that would be how you would get to hear it's getting you to 1.7 million.

### You (2026-01-30T14:44:00.425Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:44:02.342Z)

It is reasonable that we could land an enterprise account between my relationships at cbre, yours at Berkadia, Right? I mean, like, it's not and out of the question. Okay? Then next is this idea. I didn't do anything on data because I just don't know how to even try to price or say what the monetization value is of the data. But I did go in and I tried to describe the fourth layer, right, which to me is the end layer, where a transaction management system. And deals transact in exchange. They're actually transacting, right? And what I mean by that is, you know, the LOIS are going back and forth, right? We're capturing the workflows on all the, you know, the purchase and sale and the management agreement and kind of all of that, the PIP is being handled, you know, inside of an exchange when you get to the actual closing. We're using AI to do the closing prorations, the operating closing prorations. We're using AI to do the real estate tax proations. And, like, the day that the hotel closes, like we working with the title company, right, and getting all that final information back into the system. So it's your single source. Of truth. So, like, we're in it. All the way through, and our workflows are. Powering the closing of the transactions. And in this case, this is where we start to move to pricing. That's aum. It's BIPS on aum. And this is intended to be. This is like Phase four. So it's out there. It's like three, four years out, maybe five years out. Right. I'm just trying to generally show that if we could get 10 bips on the transaction. Volume, right? And I think I said we had 10% market share and we charged 10 bips. What does that equate to? And it's, you know, somewhere from 5 to 10 million in ARR. You know, I, I think this is much, much bigger, but I was, I, I was trying to just validate. Like some numbers that could. Be conservative here. And a broker, when they close on a deal, they charge anywhere from 65 to 100 bips. 65 if it's a monstrous deal, right? Like if it's $500 million deal and 100 bits if it's like a $20 million deal, you know, if it's a small deal so that I really want to go there with this platform. So I hope this math. I mean, do you have a reaction to this, or what are your thoughts?

### You (2026-01-30T14:47:18.665Z)

I think it's reasonable to put something in there. Yeah. Year three to four. Reven. Ue potential.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:47:35.942Z)

I do say that in here, right somewhere.

### You (2026-01-30T14:47:36.585Z)

Yeah. On that middle section there.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:47:40.742Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2026-01-30T14:47:44.985Z)

Comb. Ined here three to four. SaaS space from here. Too. Okay? Yeah, I think that's fine.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:47:58.342Z)

Okay? I mean, does anyone really? I mean, because we have a lot of work to do to figure out how to price this. Right? Like, there's. Yeah, okay.

### You (2026-01-30T14:48:12.665Z)

So one thing. Maybe I'm jumping ahead. Do you have anything in here for a marketplace?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:48:24.502Z)

Well. Did I put that?

### You (2026-01-30T14:48:31.385Z)

Because I think a marketplace would be. Needed before we can even begin that full transactional portion. And the marketplace itself will bring in a tremendous amount of revenue. So that's something maybe we want to insert in there before we do any type of. Transaction. Type of. What to call it. Brain dead here. But the numbers that I put together for Rediq and then what I did for Archer, it's just almost a no brainer.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:49:25.062Z)

So what. What would something. What would you say in a slide about that? Because I guess I didn't do that.

### You (2026-01-30T14:49:30.985Z)

Well, yeah. So the marketplace is just basically a way for our broker, cl. Ients to directly interact with our investor clients. Cut out. Right now, for lack of a better explanation. A lot of times these listing boards like Deal Pass. It's basically throwing it out to the masses and see how many people are interested in where ours or a marketplace type. Is instead of throwing. Out. 2000s of investors and see if anybody bites. This way, you just take your deal and. You can either put it out for. In exchange clients. Or even one to one. So at red. Iq. What we did is we had our investor clients put together a profile. What type of apartment community am I looking for? Where am I looking for? How old should it be? What class? All these investment criteria. And so when Berkadia listed a deal that met those requirements, The second that that deal was posted. Online. Those clients getting notification. And so within a minute.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:51:05.782Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:51:06.985Z)

You could have somebody looking at it. Whereas with the conventional marketplaces online, Could get there for a week before anybody notices it. And then we would get. There's different ways of pricing it. So do I want to get into the details? But either way, It brings in a tremendous amount of revenue. And it's fairly automated. It's very simple.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:51:37.542Z)

Okay? Okay? I think what I'll do is I'll add that I'll rework this transaction management slide. And put that in there first.

### You (2026-01-30T14:51:51.385Z)

And the reason I say that it has to be done before we do the other is that as part of that marketplace, there are things like.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:51:52.262Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:52:00.505Z)

The confidentiality agreement. That would be automated. You don't have to email a PDF to somebody. You don't have to sign it and email it back. Basically, it would be part of the listing. The investor checks the box. Yeah. I agree to keep it confidential.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:52:04.182Z)

Right, right, right. Right.

### You (2026-01-30T14:52:19.225Z)

And. Even do that with any of the paperwork. That's in there. So we could have a standardized LOI template, or the broker could use their own.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:52:23.382Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-30T14:52:29.945Z)

It would be embedded in the. Deal listings. So basically, you're eliminating having to do any of that. Manual process of even just emailing something out and emailing it back. And so we could gradually add. More and more. Documentation and getting things in there. That. Would build up to the point where then. We could. Help with that whole transaction layer.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:53:04.102Z)

Okay? That is an excellent point. I will. Well, maybe I will. As I look at this, I might have to put another slide before it, but. Okay, that is an excellent point. Okay. Now, I go through our competitors, and I start with single pane and profit it. These are the. I guess I should. Should I put Drew here or not? Should I put hotel bids?

### You (2026-01-30T14:53:32.825Z)

As a competitor.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:53:35.702Z)

Y.

### You (2026-01-30T14:53:39.705Z)

Good question.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:53:44.102Z)

Es. He is kind of. When I put. Because this will go to hotel people's vault, right? And so they all know Michael Rousseau and Single Payne, and I mean Single Pain is having great success at customer acquisition for the operational asset management side of this. They know chm warnick. So Drew fits in directly as a direct competitor. Like, as a direct competitor. I just thought of it this very moment. I didn't think of it last night when I were. When I was doing this.

### You (2026-01-30T14:54:17.945Z)

Yeah. Would they fall under the activists? Is it active? There. 's business partner.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:54:26.182Z)

He has a strategic partnership he's working with on actable, so he kind of falls in bucket one and bucket two.

### You (2026-01-30T14:54:32.585Z)

Yes, backward.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:54:36.582Z)

Okay? In bucket two. I want to. Ben Rafter. Right. Who's at Hotel Equities? I keep bringing this name up, but for. For. There's another very specific reason why I want to talk to him. Is Hotel equities is a customer of Otellier. And so I feel like and Atelier could really solve our data extraction issues, like, almost immediately. Right, because they're, like, actable. They already have all the data. So, I mean, they don't have all the data for every single hotel in the United States, but they have eight, you know, probably 8,000 hotels that they're serving right now, and they have P and Ls for that.

### You (2026-01-30T14:55:14.265Z)

One.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:55:21.782Z)

But what I was thinking is, well, if hotel equities likes the idea, and then they kind of. I don't want to say go with us, but they're like, oh, hey, Ali, you should look at this. This is something we would really love to have. It might help in that, you know, conversation. With Otellier about if we could partner on some kind of partnership on the data and the data extraction. And then hot stats. I didn't realize this. I guess I was just so busy working on our platform. Last year, they were acquired in May by a company called Dueto. And the woman who ran research at CBRE hotels. They shut down their research team. She just joined them. As their chief operating officer. So they're really just data, but they could also be a partner for us. Right? I mean. Right. I'm just. I'm explaining. I. I wouldn't explain it like this. To an investor, per se, but I just wanted to explain it to you because, like, these are people I'm thinking about. Could help solve the data, you know, ingestion issue for us. Okay. And then I go to our real competitors, which I think the only real competitor we have is this company called Bridge, which is doing this on the debt side. And they have strategic relationships already with Choice and Hilton. And I think what that proves is that the Berends do help if you can create strategic relationships with them. Right. Like what? My idea is around the pip, the property improvement plan, like the Capex plan. So there in my mind, our only true competitor and between us, I mean. We might want to approach them, too. I mean, about like a partnership. And then the CRE platforms that I don't think would ever create a hotel module because it's just too much of a headache for them. Okay? Competition. This slide is not turning out to be so beautiful. I've got to figure out how to fix it, but. This is the four of us. I put my uncle as an advisor because he's got such good SaaS. B2B SaaS GTM experience. Only four of us, not five of us. And then the funding.

### You (2026-01-30T14:57:55.945Z)

Thing. I think we should do. I think we should take out the part time portion. I don't think it matters. I don't think it's anybody's business who's full time or part time.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:58:07.622Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T14:58:07.865Z)

And it might cause somebody. Might cause some concern about whether or not. If our cfo in our marketing person. Is putting sufficient time into it, I guess. Personally, I just don't think. Should draw attention to full time, part time, anything else?

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:58:36.102Z)

Got. It. That's a good suggestion. Okay. And now then the funding ask, which is this is intended to be like just the total over 18 months. And we wouldn't ask for this from day one. Right. We're just going to go in small chunks.

### You (2026-01-30T14:58:54.105Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-01-30T14:58:59.142Z)

By 1.2 million 520k for people and payroll. That includes you. It includes. I do have Matt Curry in here, like, in my mind. I know it's. I can't say, Mick, but, like, I have like, like a salesperson in here. And then obviously software engineering. And then I did. I, I. Spread more money around, like strategic relationships and AI integrations. Because I do believe after what we've experienced over the past year, we're better. Served, trying to see if we can find a strategic partner on the data ingestion piece and then the PIP piece of it. I'd like to approach MindQ as a potential partner since they're already doing a big chunk of that and they're in their attack platform. Infrastructure and ops contingency. Maybe that's too low. It's just a flat 100k and that's how I get to the 1.2 million.

### You (2026-01-30T15:00:02.025Z)

Yeah. So again, I would take Claude.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:00:05.702Z)

Thoughts.

### You (2026-01-30T15:00:08.265Z)

Out. By name. I would just leave it as AI implementation data pipeline, third party APIs.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:00:15.302Z)

Okay? Does this number feel okay to you? I mean, I. I don't know if it'll be this number. Right. I'm just.

### You (2026-01-30T15:00:24.345Z)

No, that's fine.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:00:26.902Z)

Okay? I have a feeling Sherban gonna, like, flip out when he sees this, but I don't think the out of the realm of impossibility. In fact, when I was talking to Sloan a couple weeks ago, he said, you know, you could probably get a million from. He rattled off one investor, and so. I mean, I don't know if it'll be as. We'll see how hard it is to do so.

### You (2026-01-30T15:00:45.865Z)

Right. Yeah, I think I'm running, too. Was actually kind of on the low side. We can adjust it.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:01:01.142Z)

Right. I think it's on the low side, too, actually. On the people side because we're going to need software engineers and we're going to need. Yeah, okay. So the good is, it all exists in a dac. I have more work to do to clean it up and make it look good and make some of the changes, but it's further than we got. With Drew and Mark, Right? Like, it's. The revenue projections are done. The. You know how the ask is done, so. And I think it's got everything it's supposed to have in it, but my uncle will help me and, you know, clean this up and make it look tighter. I don't know if. It'll be that in that Titan form for our conversation on Tuesday with Sloan, it might look a little bit more like it looks today, but by the time we start talking to someone like Ben Rafter, it'll be in good final form.

### You (2026-01-30T15:01:31.785Z)

Yeah, yeah. Y. Es. No, I think it looks very good.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:02:08.822Z)

This took a lot of time to do.

### You (2026-01-30T15:02:09.625Z)

Yeah, no, I can see. And well worth it. I think it did a really good job. On.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:02:20.102Z)

It was hard because you have so little room, you know? And the other thing is, why I couldn't get through is Drew. And maybe my uncle will tell me this, too. Drew wanted one sentence per slide. Or, like, two sentences per slide, and I couldn't. I don't understand that, because if someone has to. Reference back to this. They need, like, the numbers to be able to, like, reference back to. And my uncle may say this is too much. You know, he may say this is not.

### You (2026-01-30T15:02:34.585Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. It is too much. But it's ruined. Because it's what we talked about before. I think you need to have one master deck that has everything. And then you just remove what's not necessary for whoever you're presenting to. If you're talking to a potential client, you can take out 90% of these slides here, but if you're talking to an investor, you probably want to have all of them. Just depends on who you're talking to. So I would say this is the deck, this is the base deck, and then we could tweak it from there.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:03:29.142Z)

Right. Okay? And do you like the color theme? Is it. Is it all right to you?

### You (2026-01-30T15:03:40.025Z)

It's done. Yeah, no, I think it looks. Fine.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:03:43.382Z)

Okay. All right. So I know we're out of time because I have to go to work at Kroger at 11, but. And I wanted to go through the POC. Can we schedule time? Are you free on Monday morning to go through the poc?

### You (2026-01-30T15:03:58.905Z)

We are the Jewel. Trying to log in? I sent you the information.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:04:02.342Z)

I did. I logged in and I looked at it. Yes.

### You (2026-01-30T15:04:02.745Z)

Okay? All right. So, yeah, it has not changed since then. I've got some tweaks to go over, but it doesn't impact any. Type of presentation or anything. So let me take a quick look at my calendar. One day. It's Groundhog Day and the day off. I wish. Well, I can beat on Monday.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:04:30.102Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-30T15:04:30.105Z)

Probably. Anytime after 10 or. 11. What did you have in mind?

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:04:35.782Z)

Yeah. 11 on Monday is great.

### You (2026-01-30T15:04:37.385Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2026-01-30T15:04:39.542Z)

Would you mind shooting me at invite? Because I'm going to hang up and go run and make sure my grogger work shirt is clean and.
