### You (2025-09-02T18:01:18.966Z)

I'm doing well. Hold on a second here. I need to change my speakers.

### Guest (2025-09-02T18:01:26.476Z)

Hi, carrie. Hey, Diane, Howard. Can you guys hear me now?

### You (2025-09-02T18:01:37.526Z)

Yay. Good. Like doing well refresh from the Labor Day weekend. So you guys do for the long weekend?

### You (2025-09-02T18:01:53.846Z)

I'm hanging out at the cottage right now, but going to head back right after this call. So been here for a couple days. So cool. I wanted to introduce Carrie to Diane and vice versa. And I think I've given Diane a background. But just as a reminder, Carrie was an intern that worked for me@red IQ. Been there for a while. So after her official internship was done, she wanted to hang on, and we were hoping to give her a full time position, if not with Red iq, with Berkadia Unfortunately, that was about the time that the market turned south. They had a hiring freeze. And much to our disappointment, we weren't able to bring Carrie on as a full time employee. But while she did her internship with us while she was getting her Master's, she did a fantastic job. I think everybody was very disappointed that we couldn't bring her on. So I thought now that we are. On the edge. Of needing some potential going to market help. Would be the first person that jumped to mind. So I just wanted to introduce you. So, Diane, hello to Carrie. Carrie, ello to Diane.

### Guest (2025-09-02T18:03:22.316Z)

Yeah. Appreciate the kind words, and great. Thanks for keeping me in mind. So, Carrie, it's so nice to meet you. I'll just start by a few minutes about my background and how Howard and I met. I am a hotel investment professional. I've spent about 25 years in this field. But I started early in my career with the broader commercial real estate sector as an acquisition analyst for office. For retail, for multifamily industrial. Back then, we did these rotations through property types. Hotel was my last rotation, and I liked it so much that I decided to pursue it as my career. And the hotel industry is a very tight real estate, tight knit hospitality is incredibly tight knit community of people. A lot of our leaders come from or have graduated from the Granola Hotel School. I am not one of them. I came up through the broader commercial real estate sector. But I fell in love with the sector because it's dynamic, it's complex. There's just so many different things going on with revenue and how you generate revenue. Because it's an actual operating business that is driven by branding. Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, all the sub Berends What the franchises create and value for you. And then the properties can be as simple. As 120 room courtyard or even lower branding than that. There's these mid market Berends now that are maybe about 90 rooms and very simple all the way up to the most complicated resort you could imagine or high luxury assets and urban markets. So what I found, though, through my career, through my 25 years, Is that. And this actually came to me through working a series of jobs. Wandering Covid where I was engaged by a company called RMR to go on a contract basis because there were I was one of the few people, many people that were let go of a job during Covid. So I joined RMR on a contract basis, helping them with some disposition work. And what I realized through that experience was nothing had changed since I started as an acquisition analyst 25 years ago. Like nothing. The only thing that was a little different, where we were exchanging documents via box. But other than that. There was no innovation whatsoever. And I had worked for a few companies prior to that that dabbled in creating business intelligence platforms. But hadn't been that successful, had been moderately successful. So I did a trek through CBRE with this idea. We should create some business intelligence software for hotel investments. CBRE elected not to do it, but that's where the idea came from. And it was just something I couldn't get out of my system. Right? It's needed. It's so terribly needed. But yet no one has really taken the step to create it. And then I met Howard through a hotel colleague of mine, Jared Kelso. He joined Berkadia to help grow that hotel vertical. And I just incredibly impressed with Red IQ because you were one of the only, well, multifamily has EVMs. But at the time you were 60% of market share in the multifamily space. From an ABM perspective. And my colleagues in multifamily at cbre were users of redIQ. Loved red iq. So I was studying red iq to figure out how you guys did it. Networked with Howard. And then just fast forward to January of this past year, Howard and I decided to partner on this. And it's a great partnership because Howard and Vinod have actually create, successfully created and monetized or been part of a team that successfully created and monetized a multifamily avm. We don't have one in hospitality. And so my hospitality colleagues and I were good partnership. It's like we bring the hospitality experience. Howard brings the project management experience and deep bench strength and multifamily investing, which is complimentary to what we do in hotels. And then Vinod brings the technology experience and the design experience. So we're excited we started on this journey. I think we talked maybe in January of last year with Howard, and then in February, we started to kick it off. We secured our first investor. For 50k right before labor Day, and I think we're securing our second investor. For about 70 to 75k within the next couple of weeks. We plan to pursue? I don't know, maybe like eight. I mean, these are friends and family. This is like a friends and family raise. So it's a pre seed raise. Right now. But as it's just been the five of us all pretty much working for free for the past eight, nine months, and we're finally getting to the point where we're raising precede capital so we'll have working capital and can be able to pay people to come in and help us in areas where we need support. You were the first person as we're advancing with this. Howard, who you've worked with Howard. So you know how wonderful his working style is, right? And he said, I know an amazing young woman. Her name is Carrie. I want to catch up with her and see what she's doing. So that was, I think, a couple of weeks ago. He caught up with you. And now taking some time to introduce us. So that's all kind of. That's our story. And I'm really happy to meet you. Howard says great things about you, so I'd love to hear about how you grew, how you went through school and decided to pursue an internship at Red IQ and what your focus is and things like that. So as I rambled all. But please tell me about yourself in your background. I can share a little bit about myself. So I started my current hr during project program management. For a number of years and was very successful in it. But I felt I wanted to do a career pivot during Covid. So I explored graduate school and went to Boston University to pursue my master's. I say marketing there. And it was a really great time. And also during that time I started interning for Howard at Red iq. I worked a very closely with the sales team as well as the product doing go to market. And overall I'm just really hungry to learn and get involved. I find that the best way to learn is really by doing. And, yeah. I held it with in terms of go to market, like a help with creating a blog. S making sure that we're able to position a product. So we can be able to cast a wide audience. So that. And like, I helped with SEO as well. But now I'm at Ingot. I lead their growth marketing efforts there. But I've also really been interested in real estate because a lot of my friends and family dabbled in it. So any opportunity to learn more and get involved, I'm just all ears. That's great. A company that you're with now. You said an ignit or inside ink it. Okay, I n k I t like that. Yeah. I n k I 2 ts I kitt and what is ink it. Yeah, Ink, it is a. So think of this like a mini Netflix. I work on the. So there's three products. So the first product is called Ingot. It's free platform. Go on. This platform is like a publishing platform. You can write stories and anyone can read it. And the second product is the Galatea Stories. If you do well on the Inkit platform, We can put your stories onto a paid A platform. The Galatea stories. And you'll earn royalty that way. And get paid through our company. And then their product I work on, it's called the Galatea. Sorry, it's called Kenny Jar tv. We rebranded ourselves recently, so it's called Candy Jar TV now. So think of it like mini Netflix. Once your stories do well, we can create a movie out of it. So it's like short form content. In that way. So I work into the B2C space in that sense. So yeah. That's great. That's awesome. So really strong and marketing. That's awesome because that's an area where we will have need. Of the three hotel people as myself, a gentleman named Mark Gordon, who's a former hotel broker. So when you're a Berkadia Right, all the multifamily brokers. Right. That was what Mark did earlier in his career. Now. He also was a hotel developer in New York. Which is not for the faint of heart at all. Developing hotels in New York is very hard, very risky. And he also loves technology and dabbles in some consulting work. But Mark is probably the closest thing we have to. Well, he's taken the title Chief Commercial Officer. And please, our titles are not really all that meaningful because other than Howard, who is clearly in a product management role, the rest of us have all just partnered and we're grabbing certain things and getting them done as a team. But Mark is probably the closest one to having true sales or marketing experience. He's also very good at distilling things down into catchphrases or helping us to come up with clever ways to say things. But he is not technically a marketing person, right? He has just been part of his career on the brokerage side. Is our third partner. Drew is very talented when it comes to hotel data. And he has great connection s. Mark has probably the best connections of the three of us. I have connections as well. But Drew is not a marketer at all. He is a date. Like a data person, right? And so we're refining ourselves is about to enter into our truly a precede series. Fun that hopefully lasts us for the next two years, maybe three years when it's all said and done, but it'll be an incredibly lean team. And we need help. Vinod has done a great job on developing our at least a holding place logo, I'll say that. But that's probably the first thing that we need is we actually need to finalize what our logo and our branding is going to look like. Right. But right now, we're using some AI templates. The node is created some nice coloring for our landing page that says, coming soon. We have a logo. But we probably want to make the logo look more modern. Maybe something more along the lines of what Elise AI looks like, or something like that with the right color palette. AI. Technology company in the multifamily sector. That is in more on the operation side, but they've done incredibly well. And their logo, just the script of it, if that makes sense. It looks very clean and modern. The pun on our name, which we'd like to try to figure out how to incorporate into the logo. Is our name is spelled kind of like ink. It a funny spell, right? Our spelling is invest in upon on the hotel industry like an inn vast and we're also playing around with. The idea of modules right within our software. And one of the modules might be called. There's something called like an investment lifecycle. It's a term we use all the time. But we might call one of our modules invest lifecycle. Like in the lifecycle. Like again upon on the name. Right. And trying to get clover and how we say things. Alicia is just one example. And Vinod has done an awesome job. We're lucky that he's able to do what he's able to do. But we need to trademark, and so we need to finalize what our logo and our coloring and all of that is going to be like. And then the next thing we're going to need is marketing. In the old days 25 years ago. The selling process was very different. Right? The selling process was much more. First, sales and marketing was just like a pretty, kind of, like, nice to have around it, unless you were a huge B2C consumer business. But on the B to B side, it was really just much sales, sales, sales, sales with a little bit of marketing around it. Unlike, say, a craft or any kind of consumer products. But the person that I follow the most and what I believe. And what I believe. We all agree on this idea. Is that marketing needs to be content driven. And the marketing actually may lead the sales process. Because if you're creating good content, maybe in the forms of a substack or regular LinkedIn post. But you need to go further than the regular LinkedIn post, right? You need to do something. Brad Hargraves H A R G R A E V E s, I think, is how you spell his name. He led a co living company called Common, and sadly, Common went bankrupt. That's like. No, I mean, Brett Hargraves is amazing, right? And he just went through that with one of his startups. But I would call him one of the preeminent marketers when it comes to content creation. He's always creating this amazing content where he's putting it on substack and developing. Sorry, I was just Alarm. I said to turn off my microwave. But it's going to be fine. Okay, you need a step away for a second? I know. I had a vague one there. It's fine. Okay. So Brad Hargraves. Like, I just, like, I just think ever since I've stumbled across his work, I just find it compelling because he's drawing the reader in by talking about real world situation s and how technology applies or like something around the investment life cycle or something like that. And then the second preeminent marketer, who I believe does an awesome job. Is the gentleman that runs Fifth Wall. His name is Brendan Wallace. And he's a little bit. I mean, he's unique. He is a Stanford grad. I think if I'm remembering this, the school doesn't care, just sometimes talks about it. But he does really great short videos on LinkedIn. They're very modern, they're all technology oriented. And so he's a person that we think we just put up there as, like, best examples. Right? He's doing better than Brad. Brendan is doing better. Video content, short form video content, and it's very, very good. And then the third person that I would say that we would hold up there is a gentleman named Graham Weaver. And Graham is with a company called Alpine Investors. He also does short form video on LinkedIn. And it's very, very good. Because what Graham does is there a VC company or a PE company, they sit somewhere in between. But he humanizes it in a way that maybe Brendan does it a little bit, but Graham really does a good job of humanizing his content that he that he posts on LinkedIn or his videos on YouTube or whatever you're following. So Mark and Drew. And I'm sorry, I'm totally dominating this conversation. Howard Vinod may have other marketers that they look to, but in my opinion, those are my three favorite. And I would love for us to be able to create our own version of something like blended like that, if that makes sense, right? That there is true content that's being created where maybe like one of our first content stories is just simply explaining AI in investment s to the hotel investment industry like a child, right? This is our company. But this is what AI is. And maybe we run some regular features. Regular feature like that, trying to explain in very simple terms what is happening with AI and how it can impact their businesses. We may want content around specific hotel investments, right? Once our software gets up and running, we will really be able to track trends. And shift s in underwriting. So there may be content that is very investment specific. And then there may be content that's very just human centric, right? Like just talking about personal stories and inspiration and things like that. There are two. Maybe there is another marketer I can mention. He does a really great job with the conference, but he is definitely the Hebrew of the hebros. But his name is Jim Merkel. He's not the nicest person if you ever sit down and meet with him. He's a hotel investor with a company called Rock Bridge. But he does something annually that's called Rock the Road, like upon on Rock Bridge. It is a cycling event. And he donates all the proceeds that people pay in the industry to go. He puts on a one day. One day, I don't know, meeting, I guess. Usually about innovation. And it's incredibly incredible. He brings people in to talk about the one year I went was probably 10 years ago, and he brought people in to talk about Uber and Lyft and all these changes that are taking place in other industries. That was just crazy, inspirational. But then. I can take a look at these. I'm sorry, I do have a hard stop at 11:30. I do want to discuss about the terms in terms of immune accepts. Like what errors are most pressing that I can support with. I can take a look at some of the creators that you just mentioned if you want to send them over. So I can also double check. I just want them spilling all these. Yeah, absolutely. And so this is where I guess Howard and I need to come together is now that we are starting to get some funding. We can't afford something for some content, for some marketing. Howard, jump in here with me and tell me your thoughts. Part time contract initially or kind of. What are your thoughts?

### You (2025-09-02T18:26:16.486Z)

Yeah, I think maybe initially it could be project based until we get sufficient funding to maybe start off on a consulting contract, maybe X number of hours a month. There's a lot of ways we can do this. I mean, I can talk to Carrie and kind of get a feel for what she's looking for. I already made it clear that we're not in a position to go full time, but I think there's other options that we can look at. But I just think maybe to get things off the ground, maybe just something that's more contract based. Let's pick out what specific projects we need. Might be an hour or two, might be 10 hours, depending on what we need. Right. So we can just kind of probably start off that way, if that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-02T18:27:12.636Z)

Great. That's great. And I'm sorry, Kara, I was just rambling off of, like. I mean, it's kind of like the vision, but to be much more specific, the most immediate needs are logo and branding. We have to figure out how to get that lockdown so we can get a trademark. And probably some help around a consumer dac. And it doesn't need to be hard. This can be AI driven, but for customers. That is Persona based so that you might have tear pages that you pull out and put other pages in, depending if it's a broker or a lender, right? And we need help creating a one page summary. Of AI because we need. We believe we need to just have something we can put in front of our potential customers and say, this is A.I. right, and it needs to be simple, something they can clearly understand. Almost written for a toddler, but those are the most immediate needs that we need help with. Okay? Yeah. The context really helps earlier. So local and branding are the main things to trademark. I can definitely create a few logos, draft something up and send it on for you guys to see. I can chat with Howard on this. I think contract basis works. And I maybe do something hourly, and then we can go from there. I was also wondering about Cadence. How often are you guys currently meeting right now? Is this something that you guys. Are there any calls that I should be. Just to be lucid. In terms of branding. We have a weekly business development call between the three hotel people that we're talking about customers and things like that. And then we meet twice a week as a full team. But that might be overkill just because we talk a lot about the technical aspects as well. So maybe that business development call that we have once a week, or maybe you join that once a month or biweekly or something along those lines. Because that would be exposure to Mark. But you need exposures like you're going to need exposure to Howard, too, right? Because Howard is the product manager and he is the best person that can translate hard concepts into explainable bite size from your standard. I didn't mix ups, Howard. Let's connect and see what works and makes the most sense. And then I can, I think mixed up, definitely. I can draft some locals up. I think that's immediate for you guys. I could do, like three logos and I could take a look at some of. I'll. Take a look at Elise AI's website to kind of get the vibe Ger as well. As well as the consumer, Dex. If that's what got it. And I know you have a very hard stop, but if I could just say this one last thing, because I don't think I can explain it in an email, so this will take me 15 seconds. One idea we're kind of playing around with, with the logo is because we're an in and we're a life cycle. Maybe there's, like, in the V is capitalized right? And maybe pushed in, there is, like, a little building, like just a little one that looks like an inn with maybe some sort of circle that indicates, like, life cycle full round. If that is just kind of like making sense from a concept. That might not work in reality. When you start to play around with logos. Right now we just have bars that are showing improvement. But the concept of being in a hotel and that this is an investment lifecycle, like we're trying to fill in the entire end to end solution. If we. From a creative perspective, if you have ideas about how to do that, we'd love to pick your brain on that. Yeah, I can take a look. Sorry. Can you elaborate a little bit more about what you mean by the lifecycle wanting to be included in the local. So a lifecycle of an investment is acquisition through disposition. During that. You have light, you have acquisition teams. And all the kind of pre ownership all. You're doing the numbers, you're studying the market. Right? Yeah. Let me see if I can fit that in. I don't know if I can try. I can try. Okay, I'll do my best. But how are. Let's connect, you and I. I have to hop. Sorry, guys. But it was so nice for you, Diane. And thank you so much, Howard. I'll just. Okay. Thank you. All right, Carrie, thank you. We appreciate your time. Have a great day. Sorry I rambled so much. Bye.
