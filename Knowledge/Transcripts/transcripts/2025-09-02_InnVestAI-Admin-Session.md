# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### You (2025-09-02T14:06:37.516Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:06:39.034Z)

Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.

### You (2025-09-02T14:06:41.436Z)

Oh, no worries.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:06:43.434Z)

You have a beautiful background behind you.

### You (2025-09-02T14:06:45.836Z)

Yeah. Been out here for a couple days.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:06:48.554Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-02T14:06:49.276Z)

Yeah. Came out on Sunday, was just planning to stay one night. And then. Yesterday during the day, head back in the evening, and I thought, this is too nice. One more night.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:07:08.474Z)

Is there a grocery store nearby that you can run and get supplies when you.

### You (2025-09-02T14:07:14.956Z)

About 15 minutes away. It's not too bad, but. Yeah, my wife came up. She still doesn't really feel comfortable staying here by herself.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:07:18.154Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-09-02T14:07:26.156Z)

So we tend to tag team. Because we've got the four animals. And three of them have things that need to be addressed every day, so it's not like we can just abandon them.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:07:37.434Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:07:39.436Z)

But yeah, she said she didn't really feel like staying out here last night. Okay. I'll stick around. But she came out yesterday and brought some food and stuff, so we were set. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:07:53.194Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-09-02T14:07:56.236Z)

I had saw something this morning. We just had the most pleasant Labor Day weekend on record. It's like sunny. Hardly any clouds every day. High temperatures. Like Friday and Saturday were in the lowest 70s. Sunday and Yesterday were like, 76. Today is supposed to be like, 79. It's starting to get back up.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:08:22.794Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:08:24.876Z)

And very cool at night. So I came out this morning. And it was still, like, in the upper 50s. So there's a lot of mist coming off the lake, and I'm like,

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:08:31.514Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:08:34.796Z)

This is nice.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:08:36.234Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-02T14:08:36.876Z)

I hope I can keep on hold on to it.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:08:40.634Z)

I miss fall. Of everything, I miss fall. There's just. It's a very short here. And I miss, like. Well, you know what you're talking about. This late August, early September evenings where you can really feel that fresh chill in the air start to come through. You know, that's just. And you just know it falls right around the corner.

### You (2025-09-02T14:08:58.396Z)

Yeah. Last year.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:09:06.794Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-09-02T14:09:08.636Z)

It'll probably be mid last couple weeks of October and all the trees back there. Just turn brilliant colors. It was just gorgeous last year.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:09:20.154Z)

That was nice, too.

### You (2025-09-02T14:09:21.996Z)

When I was in Texas, I was kind of different.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:09:24.634Z)

You know? Yes. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:09:25.676Z)

It's like there's just two seasons. And leaves and no leaves. That's about it.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:09:31.514Z)

Right. Yeah. Some people call it hot. Like, hot and less hot. I didn't do much on InnVestAI this weekend. I did. So Mark and Drew and I, on our last business development call this past week, I felt pretty strong after just contemplating the deck. I felt pretty strongly that we needed to go back and restate the problem and solution. Because what we were doing. And did I tell you this already? Because I can. I can. If you. If I already told you this, I can talk to another topic.

### You (2025-09-02T14:10:13.116Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:10:14.314Z)

Okay, let me keep going.

### You (2025-09-02T14:10:16.556Z)

Unless it was what you discussed on Thursday.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:10:20.954Z)

It's just that I feel like we were going down the route of looking what everyone else dealpath, the deal paired with it all had said about the problem and the solution and the wasted time and everything. And this past week working with AI I think that's actually an outdated way to say what we're facing here. I think the problem is figuring out how to make the most of the promise of AI, right? Like, how do you do, AI, in your job, what do you do? And yes, there's the problem of wasted time and tools in the 90s. That's all completely true. But I think people are going to it's just going people are going to really want to use AI. Leaders aren't going to really understand it. They may, how do I want to say, really value what some of the young people do with AI, but not understand fully how it works and what maybe some of the security concerns could be right. And so I just said the problem is just that. Figuring out the. I said it better than this, but figuring out how to make the most of the promise of AI and then I put the problems as how to figure out agents. How to figure out the data model. And then the third was security, because I feel like those are three things that have to get worked out. And then solution was obviously like us. And I put in the solution. That we will. Not that we have it now, but we will in the future use agentic AI, Right? To woolly that into our platform so we could handle that for them so they don't have to go have an agent with Procore or an agent with whatever you want to call it, what other software they're using.

### You (2025-09-02T14:12:23.276Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:12:35.754Z)

That we're going to build the data model for the hotel investment industry. Right? And then we can explain it the way you explained it to us on a call. Two Fridays ago, or you just did a real Thursday ago where you did a really good job explaining that. Now what happens is you have all the general LLMs, right? And they're all very general. And then you would have our data model. And so what agents would do is they'd go to the general and do the search, whatever they could find. And then they'd also go into our data model to try to pull more specific hotel information out, hotel investment. And they'd pull that all up and combine it, right? But then the security part, I think, in layman's terms, is because we will have that data model. The agent will come to us. Right versus us. Just making that data model available for anyone.

### You (2025-09-02T14:13:38.076Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:13:38.554Z)

And then I guess with what the security piece is, then we monitor what they take out of the data model, right? Or something like that, to make sure that. How will that part work?

### You (2025-09-02T14:13:48.876Z)

So here's the way to think about it. And I've been working on this over the weekend as well. So you can imagine our users our log into InnVestAI. And I can guarantee you one of the biggest concerns that you're going to face with everybody. Is, how do I make sure my data doesn't leak out? Right. There's all sorts of chatter out there and that you're sharing everything with ChatGPT. Little over a week ago, there was a big. A big ruha because they were finding Grok the ex AI mus Elon Musk's X when they were doing just a regular Google search. Their chats were coming up in a Google search.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:14:46.714Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:14:47.516Z)

Because it's all public and so personal. As long as you're not doing anything. But businesses will say, I do not want to share my data.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:14:56.074Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:14:56.876Z)

So what's going to happen is their information when they use an AI tool. And let's just say in version one, we're going to have that AI summary. So they will click the button. To generate the summary. That then goes through InnVestAI first. And make sure that there's no information, property name, client name, nothing. Goes out there and then we have the agents. Like you said, we'll go out till they maybe tax records, market comps, etc. And then another agent that goes into our documentation, our aggregated and anonymized database. So all it's going to say is when it goes out to these articles or other places, It's like, I need market data for this type of property in this area. Same thing. So it'll say all inclusive, breeze or in. So give me the information. Doesn't pass any information along. Comes back to InnVestAI, all those agents, the master agent, or the manager they call it, will take all that information, compile the report, and then it goes back to the user. So there will be no direct connection at all between the user. And the Internet. Or the LLMs. And that's something that we'll put together, a visualization of that. Very simple. It's just basically, here's the client. Here's a wall called InnVestAI. We have our processor, and then it goes out there, and we can just kind of illustrate how it will not send all the information. It'll only look for market property type. Size. Just the things it needs.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:16:57.834Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:16:59.996Z)

That'll be fine. And also on the security side. There are different ways of doing the SoC2. I sent you a link to a client or a product called Delve. A lot of it is automated now. So on that call where they were talking about how it took weeks or months to do this and you have to be recertified, takes a year. That's slowly going away.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:17:35.834Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:17:37.596Z)

I have no concerns whatsoever about the security. It's just a matter of we need to get the funding.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:17:40.954Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:17:45.436Z)

In order to do that. It won't be immediate because we won't have any data, we won't have anything. And we do have to do some documentation and everything, but instead of taking six months, it might take five days or something like that.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:17:51.514Z)

Right. Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:18:07.196Z)

It's not a concern. Yeah. So we should be okay.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:18:10.954Z)

And when, like, in our roadmap. Is that, like, let's call it a March 2026 thing? Is it, like, after we get through this first?

### You (2025-09-02T14:18:21.916Z)

Yeah. Can't really assign a date to it because it just depends on how much data. I mean, if we get a lot of clients coming in,

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:18:24.554Z)

Okay? On how much data?

### You (2025-09-02T14:18:29.996Z)

It could be faster. If our data is just slowly growing, then it's going to take us longer.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:18:31.834Z)

Okay? Okay, okay. And then when a person is doing underwriting in our model, That is only that customer will see their own data, their own underwriting. Right. And while we may use it.

### You (2025-09-02T14:18:50.956Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:18:54.874Z)

For comparable purposes, we would really be just using historical and maybe forecast for aggregated and anonymized comparables. Right? Then when we give that back to them, like, let's say they're in our platform and the day exists when they can just in the app.

### You (2025-09-02T14:19:08.796Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:19:20.954Z)

Pull the comps that they want to use and it shows an aggregated meeting average, whatever it is. That even that data is, it exits us. It's too. I call it generic. Right, because there's no specific information about any other hotel that's being underwritten in InnVestAI. That's leaving our data model.

### You (2025-09-02T14:19:50.076Z)

Right? Yeah. So the way that's set up. Is everything is at the account level. So when you sign an account and every record in a database has a unique id. Automatically generated. So if Diane Fox Consulting LLC has an account, then there's a number. And then Diane might have three employees or three users. So each of those users also has unique id, so you'll know exactly who's doing what. And that ID is connected to your account. So that way, when Howie's investment company logs in, he's going to have the same things. And you could be working on the exact same deal I'm working on, right? Maybe we don't change the name. Maybe we're both working on the downtown Hyatt.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:20:46.794Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:20:46.796Z)

So the property name is going to be the same number of units, everything's going to be the same. But I will never be able to see yours, so you'll never be able to see mine.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:20:56.954Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:20:57.036Z)

So then we have an aggregated and anonymized database. So that all of this information you're putting in. All the information I'm putting in goes to this aggregated database. But all we know is we have to have that unique ID for the deal itself. So if we use the star id, whatever we do, we know that you and I are both working on that exact same Hyatt down down hotel. And so that data goes into the model, but it does not include account or user. So your data, my data, it's all combined. The historical should be nearly identical, depending on if there's any timing issues. You'll have your forecast, I'll have mine. So there would still be two rows in the aggregated database. That came from. One came from you, one came from me. But we know that that particular deal is the same deal. Then when we start putting together market reports, There is no user id, there's no account id, and even the name wouldn't be displayed right. And we would also have to have limitations. So if I say I want to get a comparable of downtown. To match up to my Hyatt. We would have to implement a minimum number of deals. So that I can't pull up downtown Hyatt, do a market comp. And I only see one other Hyatt. I would know that. That's you, right?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:22:41.674Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:22:43.916Z)

Or the same thing if there's only one other cop in the market. And it has 315 beds. We know that. Oh, well, that's the Hilton hire, you know, if you can't identify it, so you won't have an address. You won't have a name. And we have to set. Usually it's like, anywhere from three to five. So if we don't have three to five cups, In that market. When we run the cops, we're just going to say, sorry, we don't have sufficient data. To do that, right?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:23:17.674Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:23:19.196Z)

So it's going to have to be a little bit of the fine print that's on there that says we have to have a minimum of X number of properties.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:23:27.674Z)

Yeah. No, hotel industry was really used to that because of Star. They have a lot of rules around things like that that we can.

### You (2025-09-02T14:23:28.396Z)

Now. Yeah. Well, that's common. Yeah. All real estate does that. Multifamily is. They're huge. Stickler on that because they all have the same number of units. It's easy to tell.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:23:46.314Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:23:46.956Z)

Which one it is if you see them broken out individually, right? So that's what we would do is we'd say, okay, well, here's our Hilton downtown, and then here are five comps. And so Hilton. And then you just have the aggregate of the cops. So we might show the total number of beds, or the keys might be 2015. Right. And whatever number. And you can go from there. But that way I can't look at the comps and know which ones they are.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:24:24.154Z)

Right. And then switching gears for a second. I've been thinking about what objections we might face, and security is one. But the first one I'm thinking is everyone and their brother is going to believe that they themselves can just use AI to improve the speed of their underwriting.

### You (2025-09-02T14:24:47.916Z)

Up the camp cap.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:24:52.394Z)

And then the bigger companies like Starwood and Blackstone may say, well, we have sufficient enough data. In our own. Data model, right? That we don't need to use you guys. And we can use Claude to improve our underwriting speed. What other objections do you think we will come up against, given how the language is changing and the common course of understanding what it is? Let's brainstorm. Is that right? For a couple minutes on, like, what you think?

### You (2025-09-02T14:25:31.596Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:25:31.754Z)

Someone could say, oh, well, I don't need you. I can do this myself.

### You (2025-09-02T14:25:36.076Z)

So that's a perfect use for perplexity or GPT.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:25:41.194Z)

Oh, yeah, I guess it's true. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:25:42.956Z)

I've done this many times for even getting down to the feature level. One of the things I like best is when you've got it down. Next question is. Okay, tell me why this won't work. Or tell me, tell me what objections are users will have. So. I would put together a document. That you can upload into the chat rather than having to type everything out. But be as specific as possible about what InnVestAI is, what it does. Take the Persona document. In fact, I'll send it to you. I've already got the Persona document in the PDF because I'm doing something very similar right now. Just give it as much background information. And just ask it those types of questions. What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses? What objections would we get? And I would break it down by, well, what I'm doing right now is I'm breaking it down by Persona, so you don't need to do the same thing, but it does an amazing job. Of coming up with poking holes in it. Some of it. Obvious. But I don't think I've ever done that without having something come up that I hadn't considered.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:27:10.714Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:27:12.236Z)

We can do that, but what I'm doing right now is. Going Persona by Persona. So I have every prd that was written for the abm uploaded. The formulas, the AI roadmap, the Persona document. I've got everything uploaded into a Claude project, so I just started to say, okay. Let's take a look at Persona number four, Lender. And then my very first question is based on the information in the knowledge base. What are the top five features that this Persona will use? It'll come out and tell you which top five. Then my next question is, what are the three least valuable features for this person? A. And it'll come up with the three. Like, for example, a lender doesn't need to have the investment returns. Or anything like that. The partnership, everything that's totally irrelevant. So it'll come up with those. And then my last question is, what are we missing?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:28:21.834Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:28:28.876Z)

What else could we add into here? And it comes up with a pretty decent list of things that we should be adding. So my intention is kind of breaking it down into the groups we've already identified lenders, appraisers. They don't need to get into the specific details that maybe we should use them first. So when I get all three done, which I did finish yesterday, I just haven't done the consolidation, the next step is to say, okay, look at these three Personas. Tell me, what are the common threads between each for the most valuable, the least valuable and what we're missing. And give me an outline of what we should do first. And so if there's anything missing or anything common, we can go through there and that will help guide our near term load map. Some of the stuff. That has come up with integrating into the various appraisal tools. Sure that's a great idea, but we can't do that right away. Because we don't want to just dwell on those three. We still want to get to the investors and brokers. So we'll keep going like that. But that's extremely useful. Tool for the GPT to help out with.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:29:54.714Z)

There are two other Personas that I wanted to mention. I don't know. When we talk about who the six Personas are, we go through it. The hotel operators, their feasibility teams. And their OPS teams, actually, because the OPS teams review the fees like they always have to go to a senior OPS person to have their performance reviewed before they're released. And so. And they could be a user that helps us build our database. Very, very quickly because the comment, remember that, well, if I'm an operator and I'm using this, I don't want all of my comps to be in a totally different AI tool or whatever software tool I'm going to want. Right. So they're one. And again. And how they would be using it. Is the feasibility group underwriting the senior ops team? To review it if we ever get into true asset management. It could be to do the monthly reviews so that we break down the work there. They sometimes project manage renovations, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they do. It depends on the organization.

### You (2025-09-02T14:31:10.476Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:31:23.994Z)

And then the last user is the hotel Berends because they have big feasibility teams as well. If it's a brand managed hotel, they have to have their senior ops team sign off just like a third party management company. And then the entire Franchise Administration Department. Is an area where I'm sure they're all working right now. To bring AI into improving franchise administration. But I'm just going to give you an example of how some things connect, right? Like a franchise agreement, they'll require you to have the ownership structure. And so the ownership structure is something we may be capturing earlier in the deal. If we are created at some point, right? If we are doing, like, waterfall analysis, right? Or something like that. If we ever integrate with a Juniper square. They also need the organization or the structure, right, to be able to handle all the managing the payouts and everything like that. But the franchise administrator needs that. And it's handled right now. They're usually given a diagram in a PDF. Right. That has. So this could all be a much more live kind of thing. They also have oftentimes LT V or if it's a development. An LTC maximum That is called 70, 75%. So that could be something that we feed directly into their software, I guess will be software that they're creating. And then there's the pip, which is huge. It's just the entire process is very antiquated. And can be greatly improved. Not from day one. Right. This is something that will probably tackle in the second half of. Let's just say we're starting a new year. September 2nd. Yay. It's almost like starting a new school year, right? Then the second half of this fiscal year for us. And then, from a franchising perspective, the other reason why we want to include them as a user. Is right now. They send in a batch data form. All new supply information to CoStar. And it is the majority of CoStars supply database. All the Berends do this, right? Hyatt does it, Marianne does it, Hilton. So if we could get them to just send it to us too, right?

### You (2025-09-02T14:34:34.236Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:34:35.274Z)

Then that would be just incredibly valuable for us and help the underwriting process so that you can speed it up. And the reason they have it is because people have to go through the franchise application process, Right. And so they need to know they have milestones that get set in a term sheet. You have to be breaking. Ground by a certain time. This. This, this, this. So they are monitoring that process, and that's how they have. I don't want to call it 100% accurate information, but it's better than just trying to do something like that. On your own. So those are two other Personas that we should consider when we're doing our Persona lists. And then I think we've really captured everyone in the hotel ecosystem.

### You (2025-09-02T14:35:28.556Z)

All right, that's aggressive.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:35:31.354Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T14:35:31.596Z)

I can tell you right now, looking at the roadmap. Based on Persona. Obviously, we're going to be starting with the lenders and appraisers and the high level. Then we would probably go into the investors and brokers. And finish off with asset managers. That in itself is probably going to be close to a year. Maybe not so much because we can build it. But we have to test it. The building can be done in a certain amount of time. The testing is about double the time. Right. Because we are reliant on our testers schedule. We don't have. Testing employees. We need testing from our beta. So you always want to extend the time out for testing. That doesn't mean we can't be working on other features while they're testing, right? We're not going to just sit around, twiddle our thumbs, waiting for them to come back to us.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:36:35.754Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:36:38.316Z)

But we need to be able to go in increments. So I would think that just Even the basic ABM, let's say, I think 12 months is a little long, so maybe nine months. So that takes us into next June. Ish. Then we can start looking at integrations and what are some of the other things we need. So, along with the avm, we want to have the AI generated Summary. And then we want to extend that out a little bit, too, because we can't just focus on the model. Because going back to your comment, yes, Blackstone, the other big clients. Have the resources to do that on their own. And maybe even the resources to get their own market comps. We may never have Blackstone in some of those other big guys as a client. That's okay. There's plenty of others that we can service that don't have that function or that capability, that bandwidth. But we do have to. At the same time we're building out the apm, we do have to build out some of those AI features. At the same time. So to do that. Kind of goes back to that whole conversation we had that we need to get with the node. Figure out who would be our. Our AI expert who's going to guide the development of that. And we may have to have almost like a separate team just devoted to AI. It wouldn't have to be the same size as what the node has. It could be one person. Could be one person plus an engineer, one product manager engineer. So we have to figure that out because.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:38:32.954Z)

Right. I like that idea because it's like they are almost partners in it, right? And they tag team who's going to research, you know what I mean, how they're going to communicate with you and Vinod. And so it would be you would have a resource and Vinod, whatever resource, and they are the ones that are just kind of helping bring those solutions to both of your functions.

### You (2025-09-02T14:38:38.316Z)

Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's highly specialized. And there's a lot of organizations out there. I don't think we would need to have a separate integrations team. But that's very similar to AI But I think AI is starting to make inroads on that. So that they could probably be combined. But for the APIs, for the different integrations and how do we connect the database. That's kind of a specialized thing as well. But that would be third on the list behind having a specialized AI. And the same thing too, from the developer standpoint. I have no idea what Vinod's team is capable of. Because they're young. Which might be an advantage. They may know AI better than us, or they may just be too fresh to really get into it.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:39:51.674Z)

Right. And the other thing is the hospitality industry is on the op side, the revenue piece of it. Is already fairly technologically savvy, if I can say that. Right. We may be able to tap into a labor pool there that already has a really good sense of the technology API. Right. Because the real estate piece of it.

### You (2025-09-02T14:40:19.676Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:40:35.994Z)

You and I. I mean, we could do the research about. Okay, It's. Ryan, it's. You know, this is how you get to the individual tax department database. You know what I mean? Just the two of us could do that. And then on the engineering side, I don't know, again, it might be someone who's very young, right, who just is so fascinated and trying to figure this out.

### You (2025-09-02T14:41:02.876Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:41:04.074Z)

So there may be a market pool that's just it's maybe easier to find someone in the US that is going to be still expensive, but wouldn't totally break our budget if we sourced from that.

### You (2025-09-02T14:41:16.396Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:41:20.554Z)

Lake on the revenue side.

### You (2025-09-02T14:41:22.476Z)

Yeah. No, I think it's a great idea. So anyway, for this week, I plan on having the long term roadmap. Put together, because I know that's what Mike wanted to see. He wanted to see a three to five year. So I'm going to kind of work on that and kind of break it down by Persona as well. And we've got. From a feature standpoint, I think we're pretty good. I just want to get that research that I'm doing now for each person, a look for that common thread to help to prioritize and go from there. So that's what I'm going to be working on right now, getting that taken care of.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:42:15.674Z)

Okay, that's perfect. What I'm working on this week is, by God, that DAC is going to be done by Sunday night, and it's getting much closer at. What I need to go back in is use what you sent me to do, like one or two AI specific pages. The problem and the solution now are all around AI. But I still feel like it needs to be called out in better detail. And I need to put the budget in there. But the budget isn't the way the invest. You saw it. The investor deck wants it at a very high level. It's not a lot of detail. It's like X amount and it's going towards people, it's going towards technology, it's going towards software or something, so that's not hard at all.

### You (2025-09-02T14:42:51.836Z)

Right. Here.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:43:08.394Z)

I know how to do the tam, but then I need to go back through and read what you sent me about the pricing strategy, so I need to dive into that and really review what you sent me on the pricing strategy.

### You (2025-09-02T14:43:22.556Z)

Yeah. With the TAM again. I know I keep harping on this, but make sure you drill down to the other levels as well. Total addressable market. That's like the pie in the sky. That's. What if I got everybody, right? Which is not realistic. But if we can show that we are, that we understand that. And we know what our potential is, and then what potential of that we could get. That's more realistic. Right. I mean, I like those articles that I sent where a lot of them will skip right past the tam because nobody's going to get 100% of everything. Yeah, but it's good to show that we know what the total is.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:43:58.634Z)

Right. Blue sky. Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:44:15.516Z)

Speaking of the roadmap as well. So I briefly showed that for the thing that you and I worked on before where I also had here's your pre seed funding marks post. I will get that to you as well because that breaks down the AI roadmap.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:44:34.234Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:44:34.956Z)

In pretty clear because the one that I sent you also includes everything, right? Some that we could be three years away from doing so. This one will at least break it down into the four steps. Of what we're looking at for the near term. So let me get that to you today. I'll have time today to do that.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:45:00.954Z)

Do you think on AI we should include? I don't know, I'm leaning Howard not. But I'm going to ask the question over LinkedIn. LinkedIn. Over the past two week, there have been so many articles about failed use cases using AI, Right? Was it Harvard did a stat or. I mean, it was something, and everyone was just jumping on the bandwagon.

### You (2025-09-02T14:45:23.916Z)

Mit. Yeah. Mit did that? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:45:26.394Z)

But maybe right, but maybe the content wasn't quite, quite right. Because I don't know, I just read a lot of people saying they didn't approach this analysis the right way. But should we put something, I mean, do you think we need to be proactive and put something in there like that, or do you think the market is savvy enough to just understand that that's not true.

### You (2025-09-02T14:45:39.116Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:45:50.474Z)

Or do you think our intended reader of this, who's a potential investor, will have read something like that on LinkedIn and say, oh, but use cases just aren't penciling out.

### You (2025-09-02T14:45:57.756Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't. I don't think we would reference that. Study because like you said, there are a lot of people who are debunking it, that they use throwing methodology or incorrect assumptions. But, yes, I do know that. You know, it's. That's why they call it the hype cycle is that when something comes out and all of a sudden it's super popular with everybody, everybody jumps on the bandwagon. I mean, you can go back to big Data. Everybody had to have big data, but they didn't know what big data was, right? Little thing that comes along. There's always a hype cycle. And the same thing with AI But AI was different because it was so huge. That everybody felt we have to have AI. And that's why when we had these meetings, that's why I kind of pushed back on everybody, because we don't want to fall into that bucket of alt hype and not being able to.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:46:57.914Z)

Back.

### You (2025-09-02T14:47:05.756Z)

Go through with it, right?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:47:06.314Z)

Deliver.

### You (2025-09-02T14:47:08.556Z)

So I would say rather than pointing out to study, I think we should point out the fact that, yes, we are releasing AI features.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:47:09.114Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-02T14:47:21.756Z)

And we will use that. In marketing and product development, but tell them that we are getting market data and we're doing it. Diligently. Based on best use cases. Knowing that the data is still not there. That agentic AI is still in its early stages. Just kind of. If we can just show that we are fully aware of the implications of AI, the dangers of AI, and that we are approaching it in a very methodical fashion and not just diving into the deep end. I think that would be sufficient.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:48:05.914Z)

Okay, okay.

### You (2025-09-02T14:48:06.316Z)

So I think that's probably what they're looking for more than anything, because they're not dumb.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:48:12.314Z)

Great.

### You (2025-09-02T14:48:13.356Z)

They probably know 20 times more than we do about it. If we over promise or if we just say, yeah, we're going to do fully automated underwriting with AI and they know that that's not possible yet. I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:48:35.274Z)

Right. And then the last thing I have for you is that Mike is in right where he's talking about wiring funds and stuff like that. He did suggest we set the initial valuation for the company at 500k. And so his 50k would be conditioned on the very initial balance of the company being 500k. And he has talked to me over and over about dilution. Right. Every time you add new investors, it all gets deluded to be diluted. But I need to just sit down and do the math. I need to say, he's done the math. So we're such good friends. I may say to him, can you send the math over to me? But I'm just going to go ahead and say, a million shares to start out with, like, how does it look?

### You (2025-09-02T14:49:03.836Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:49:26.074Z)

Know. How does it play out with the money that we need? And then I guess I'm going to try to work through getting to series A. Fun like I'm going to work through getting. I'll call it 400,000. I'm going to try for this for the next six months by these kind of 50 100k checks. Or seven months through the end of March. And then on second, friends and family raise. That is maybe a little bit more like gives us another year. Right. So we've got now 18 months under our. And this is what Chelsea had told us when we she was talking about break it in. Right. And then probably one more just to get us to like a 24 month mark with that smaller, then I'm gonna put a series a raise in there. And I'm gonna just create a schedule that shows mathematically what happens with the shares and all of that, so we can all be on the same page. From a won't work out exactly like that. Right. But from how it works perspective.

### You (2025-09-02T14:50:34.076Z)

Right. All right. Well, that is an area that I have never been involved with. Even though I've been in the software industry, I've never had the value anything. So I'm leaving that to you and Mark and Drew. I think Mark and Drew probably have experience in it, so you guys let go ahead and work that out.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:50:54.474Z)

We're going to work that out. Yeah. In fact, we have a call at noon, so.

### You (2025-09-02T14:50:58.156Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:51:00.394Z)

And then Mark's going to a big event tonight in New York. Like a hotel, some kind of hotel HML event or something like that. So I'm encouraged because he wants to talk about it with people at the event. And so each day I see mark. Engage more and more and more. So I'm really encouraged by that piece of it. And he does add a lot when it comes to things like marketing. He's smart and clever in the way he thinks about saying things.

### You (2025-09-02T14:51:21.756Z)

Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:51:34.714Z)

But my heart is uplifted because it's not like he's just sitting on the sidelines now. He's really digging in and thinking about who he's going to talk to and what he's going to say.

### You (2025-09-02T14:51:46.156Z)

Yeah. All right, that's encouraging. Cool. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:51:51.994Z)

All right. And we talked to Carrie later today, right?

### You (2025-09-02T14:51:54.156Z)

Yes. Two o'clock, I believe.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:51:55.434Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T14:51:56.556Z)

2:15 Somewhere around there.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:51:59.274Z)

Perfect. All right. Happy September 2nd. I kind of feel like. Right. This marks a new chapter for us. We have our first investor.

### You (2025-09-02T14:52:04.876Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:52:11.994Z)

Who knows? Making a lot of progress. And so the next four months is going to be really important for us to just put our heads down and make this happen.

### You (2025-09-02T14:52:24.076Z)

So where do we stand on getting the LLC documents reviewed and finalized?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:52:31.034Z)

We have to. I asked Drew to have his attorney look at it.

### You (2025-09-02T14:52:34.556Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:52:35.994Z)

So he was going to do that. I'm going to go back through one more time and run it through Perplexity about all the spousal piece. The spousal piece of it. Like, is it overkill? And just try to make sure. I don't think it is, but I'm going. To ask that very specific question if we overdid the spousal piece. And then I believe I may have made one error in that there are carve outs as far as what we can do from a competitive perspective with competitive software or things like that in the LLC agreement, right? And drew. Well, I shouldn't say carve out they're provisions, right? To say this is. You can't really go create exactly competitive product and be working on it at the same time. I gave a carve out for Drew with Hotel biz, but Sherbin thinks I may have carved it out too big and so I need to go back and review to see if I didn't gate it enough. Does that make sense? And then I think if everyone. Probably it's just best if everyone reads it or uses AI to go through it. And then this is the last thing I'll say. Kind of like you were talking about with the objections. I think before the end of the week, what I might go through is make a list of, I'll call it 10 to 15 real world problems that we could face. Like we flat out fail. What happens if. We flat out fail. In the first seven months. If we flat out fail three years from now, what happens if the next most likely thing is we all want to phase out a different periods, right? You may want to mark me. Want to maintain his economic interest. But he may want to step back from being an active date. Right? And you may want that at some point in the future, too, right? Just trying to think through what you might want that seven or eight years from now, right? I'm kind of thinking this as we own this for, like, 15 years, but I realized there will be an infusion of capital that greatly changes the structure of the company when we hit the series funding. I'll probably put something in. What if someone were to leak information? And it'd almost be a bad boy act, right? That really causes us trouble, you know what I mean? Like leaks, confidential information. So I'm going to go through and try to think about what does Someone dies. What if someone goes bankrupt? What? If someone. So if you have anything that just pops into your head that are real world problems, shoot them over to me this week because I want to do it at once and just see what the AI revealed that LLC does.

### You (2025-09-02T14:55:38.076Z)

Okay? Yeah. No, that's a good idea. That is a good point, because there is a clause in there that says that we can work on other projects without limitation. Including competitor problems, which I thought. Okay? Maybe that would be something where we would want to include some language about intellectual property. At least. Right. So, yeah, we can work on. I have no intention of doing this, but what if we wanted to put together. Maybe even Odi and I want to put together the same thing for multifamily, right?

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:56:17.674Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:56:18.716Z)

Which is fine. But we still want to protect the invest intellectual property. Whatever we can do there. So I think that's probably a fair thing to put in there. The other thing is, I wouldn't get too hung up on the numbers, the dates and the numbers. Because remember, we can modify this anytime with a vote, so. I wouldn't. I went to LA getting this signed.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:56:43.514Z)

Yeah, that's true.

### You (2025-09-02T14:56:47.756Z)

Because of that. My two senses. Maybe work on the questions first, and then we can deal with the dates and numbers later.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:56:50.634Z)

But, I mean, I think. The questions. Right. Okay. And so I think, I mean, we could probably get this sign by the end of the week or early next week and just put this to bed and get it in our data room so that.

### You (2025-09-02T14:57:09.516Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:57:10.874Z)

Cool. All right. This was a good conversation. We will talk later today.

### You (2025-09-02T14:57:12.396Z)

All right. Yeah, a couple times.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:57:17.994Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-02T14:57:18.716Z)

All right, see you then.

### Guest (2025-09-02T14:57:18.874Z)

Bye.
