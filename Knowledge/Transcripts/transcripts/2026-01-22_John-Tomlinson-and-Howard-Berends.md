**[18:02:55] Speaker 2:** Hey, Howard.

**[18:02:56] Howard Berends:** Hey, how are you?

**[18:02:59] Speaker 2:** Here he is.

**[18:03:00] Howard Berends:** I'm doing well.

**[18:03:04] Speaker 2:** I wanted to see. Just got done with the workout. I'm about to hit the road. I thought I'd be on the road by now, and I'm not.

**[18:03:12] Speaker 2:** Would you be okay if we did 130?

**[18:03:15] Howard Berends:** Whatever works for you.

**[18:03:16] Speaker 2:** Okay?

**[18:03:18] Howard Berends:** Whatever works.

**[18:03:20] Speaker 2:** It'd be fine if you don't mind me being on the road about 130 and we could do Google Meet is. I just want to see your face at least.

**[18:03:26] Speaker 2:** Or you can just call myself at 130. You tell me.

**[18:03:31] Howard Berends:** Why don't we just go with the Google Meet? If you want to just rejoin the same meeting.

**[18:03:35] Speaker 2:** That's perfect. Yeah. Okay. All right, great. I'll do it. All right, thanks, buddy. All right, bye.

**[18:03:36] Howard Berends:** Okay?

**[18:11:28] Howard Berends:** Stop, stop, stop, stop.
