# Transcript for: Vinod | Howard 1x1

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:17.664Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:17.665Z)

Hey. Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:19.904Z)

How are you? Gr. Sorry, I'm going to be off camera.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:24.545Z)

It's fine.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:26.864Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:26.945Z)

I'll do the same. So how's your day going?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:31.664Z)

How are things? Day is going great. We had lot of food here at Morgan Properties today. There was some event regarding breast cancer awareness.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:44.225Z)

Nice.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:45.104Z)

And you got to donate, and then you get lunch.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:49.505Z)

Very cool.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:50.784Z)

So yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:51.105Z)

So are you there now or are you at home?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:52.144Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-10-29T17:31:54.705Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:31:54.864Z)

No, I'm here. I'm just joining through my audio call, and then it's kind of break time right now.

### You (2025-10-29T17:32:00.545Z)

Y. Eah. Cool.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:32:04.224Z)

Yep. How are things at you and.

### You (2025-10-29T17:32:08.225Z)

Going all right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:32:10.464Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:32:14.385Z)

Ready to. I am clear on the year zero now. The proof of concept has it built in. So now I just need to finish up the documentation, and I think what I'm going to do is create a separate PRD rather than try to go into the existing PRDs and squeeze it in. Because it touches, touches, touches, like three different areas. You know, it's got the revenue expense and then the avm. Formulas.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:32:38.064Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:32:48.065Z)

So I think. I think. I think I'll just go ahead and create another one, and I'll go back to those other ones.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:32:49.984Z)

Of course.

### You (2025-10-29T17:32:53.985Z)

And just, like, insert. Reference with a link to the new one, just to make it simple. But. Shouldn't take too long. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:33:02.944Z)

Yep, yep, that sounds great. Amazing. Amazing. And then yeah, if you could please have a look at the app on staging environment whenever you get a chance. Probably will close out the MVP feature soon. So it did receive some feedback on Drew.

### You (2025-10-29T17:33:22.785Z)

All right. Yeah. Yeah. I did talk to Diane and Drew about the demo version.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:33:29.664Z)

So, yeah, we.

### You (2025-10-29T17:33:35.105Z)

And I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of put together. What I feel. Is the minimum that we should do. Actually, maybe the maximum we should do for a demo. Which would be Create a deal. Upload a document. Show. The data being populated. Tweak, you know, go into the pro forma. Make a couple of entries to show how everything changes. And then a quick AI summary.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:34:20.864Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T17:34:21.025Z)

Because what I want to do is I want to be able to do it in 10 or 15 minutes. So anything beyond that becomes a training session. It's not a demo. So I expect a little bit of pushback from Mark. You know, because he's always been saying, well, we have to have every. Everything has to be working before I can go and do a demo. But I know Drew and Diane and I are aligned, that we don't have to do anything, and that a lot of those other features we can just then go from a live demo. To a PowerPoint and just show this is what we've got. You know, we could even say that, you know, with the ones that are done, and we can just say we're testing. I think that'll be sufficient. Because we gotta get those checks deposited. Asap, so we can't wait. But that does mean we will have to tweak the UI to be as close to the POC as possible. So that's one thing that I want to go through the staging and just kind of.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:35:22.464Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:35:33.585Z)

Make a few notes on.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:35:34.784Z)

Yeah, Put your feedback in there. I think it's very close. I don't know what exactly is left, but, yeah, whatever is, let's just put it in feedback.

### You (2025-10-29T17:35:36.385Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:35:44.784Z)

And then we should be good there.

### You (2025-10-29T17:35:45.905Z)

I'm not looking for it to be identical. So, I mean, it doesn't have to be pixel, but pixel per pixel. Perfect matching, whatever. I mean, it's gonna be reasonable.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:35:49.664Z)

Right.

### You (2025-10-29T17:35:56.625Z)

As long as it's generally they're not gonna remember.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:35:58.624Z)

Right.

### You (2025-10-29T17:36:00.225Z)

You know, three months from now when they're using the tool, whether it was, you know, laid out perfectly or not. So I'm not gonna worry too much about that. But I am glad that they are making some very good progress. Get this year zero taken care of, and then we should be. Good to go.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:36:26.064Z)

Yep. Sounds great. Sounds great.

### You (2025-10-29T17:36:30.545Z)

And then Diane did mention. She was concerned that Mark is about the only one who hasn't really brought up much about the llc. But as we talked, you know, we both kind of agreed that he and Drew do have quite a few conversations. And I'm wondering. Or hoping that Mark is working with Drew with anything that he. Wants clarification on or changed, because basically, right now it's just Drew and Diane. And, you know, I told her that once those two come to an agreement and they have what they consider to be the llc, that you and I just need to read through it. And sign it. We've already given our input.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:25.904Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:37:30.225Z)

Just want to make sure it's good to go, because she's. She's concerned that we could just keep going on and on and on forever.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:36.864Z)

Yeah, that's true.

### You (2025-10-29T17:37:38.065Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:38.864Z)

It's been. It's already been so many months. We are not closed on llc.

### You (2025-10-29T17:37:39.025Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's ridiculous.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:45.184Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:37:45.265Z)

Yeah. So, yeah, she expects the check from. Driftwood. Or. Yeah, yeah, this week.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:56.784Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:37:56.945Z)

We don't. We don't have the llc and we don't have a banking account to deposit it in.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:37:57.744Z)

And that's the only. Yeah, I think Drew has kind of stretched that account thing for long time.

### You (2025-10-29T17:38:07.185Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:38:11.184Z)

So that's the only check we have tripped out, right? There's nothing from Mark side or anywhere else.

### You (2025-10-29T17:38:16.225Z)

No, nothing from larc and drew.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:38:19.824Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:38:20.625Z)

Her and her husband's friend. That Mike is still interested.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:38:24.064Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:38:28.225Z)

I think he's probably waiting to see. How we structure the deal with Driftwood, and then that'll give him some indication of. Where he would stand, I guess, but that's still an option. So we could get another 50 grand in here? But Diane does have a couple of other people. She's kind of focusing on female led founders. There's a couple of organizations, so I don't know. I just think she's going to be the primary fundraiser. At first and hopefully I think Mark's waiting to get the big checks I don't think he wanted. I wouldn't be surprised if in his mind, 75,000 or $100,000 isn't worth his effort. He probably wants to beat the one to bring in the seven figure checks. So we'll see how that goes. But yeah, she. She mentioned also. You know, we were talking about the testing. You guys have been doing the financial statements. And, you know, I made a comment that it's going very well, and we do have quite a few statements to test, but they're from a limited number of companies, so we don't have a ton of different formats and I made a comment that, you know, I'm afraid that, you know, we will get a client who uploads a document that. Probably will fail, and it'd probably be some small company that just does something differently. And that kind of spurred her that there are. You know, there's the big organization of hotel that has the. The put together the standardized chart of accounts and everything else. But there's two other ones that are very specific. One is the American Asian hotels, something or another. And the other ones. And essentially they are. For the small investors, and we started talking. I'm like, you know, those are the perfect ones to go for. To develop a relationship with that particular. Organization. Whatever. Like the american asian hotel. Thing. And maybe sponsor something and just get our name out. And they could be a sales funnel, right? I mean, if there are. If they're an organization and they endorse InnVestAI, we could get their members signing up, you know?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:41:01.744Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T17:41:15.105Z)

Easily so.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:41:16.464Z)

Right? Yeah. If nothing, at least a marketing right. Some more hits on our website.

### You (2025-10-29T17:41:20.225Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just to get our name out there and, you know, get, get some legitimacy if we are, you know, maybe not officially endorsed, but, you know, if they allow us to sponsor and do things that kind of imply is that they. Are promoting our services, so we'll. We'll see how that goes. She's. She's got some connections there, so she's gonna work on that as well.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:41:47.024Z)

Right.

### You (2025-10-29T17:41:51.345Z)

So where. Where are we in terms of accuracy? Are we processing?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:41:51.664Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-10-29T17:41:57.745Z)

What? What percentage at the top of your head?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:41:59.424Z)

Yeah. I mean, whatever format Drew had provided, right?

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:04.945Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:42:06.304Z)

I think we are able to process most of them.

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:07.745Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:42:09.264Z)

As far as accuracy is concerned. The point I created will have to test thoroughly, but as far as our devil post testing goes, I think it's very accurate.

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:14.865Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, I was. I was wondering if there's.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:42:23.744Z)

So yeah. It's all cl 4.5.

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:26.145Z)

A. Okay, okay. I was wondering if there's a way we can automate it.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:42:28.624Z)

Yeah, and I think it's doing pretty good. Live testing.

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:34.385Z)

Do you have? Do we have the export to Excel? Ability yet.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:42:40.704Z)

Yeah, we can do that. We don't have it yet, but we can do that.

### You (2025-10-29T17:42:42.705Z)

Well, that's when I was wondering is if we could. Import the data, extract it, process it and then export it to Excel. And then you could do probably would be easier to do a side by side or just create a macro to go back. And compare row by row automatically rather than manually. Going across. But they're. Again, I mean, there's not that many rows, so even if we just had to visually compare the two, probably wouldn't take two terribly long.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:43:19.024Z)

Right? Right. Yeah. I'm an export. Excel we can definitely develop that. Shouldn't take much time.

### You (2025-10-29T17:43:24.065Z)

Yeah. Yeah, it might be helpful.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:43:28.384Z)

Yep, yep, we can definitely work on that. But for now, we're just focusing on whatever feedback Drew had provided.

### You (2025-10-29T17:43:28.785Z)

Because. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:43:35.104Z)

We are also waiting for some feedback from your side.

### You (2025-10-29T17:43:36.785Z)

Y. Eah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:43:38.944Z)

And then just want. Want to wind up the demo thing first so that, you know.

### You (2025-10-29T17:43:45.585Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:43:46.864Z)

Kind of say, yeah, we are ready to demo.

### You (2025-10-29T17:43:47.665Z)

Let me finish. The. The prd for the year. Zero. We gotta get that. In. There. And I know Siobhan sent the email on Sunday that he was looking for that documentation. Like, give me a couple days. So it's been more than a couple days. I gotta get that done now. I was waiting until we had that review with Drew.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:44:04.944Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I. I love this guy. There are very few guys who will ask for work up front. He's like, oh, I don't have work. Give me more. I just love him.

### You (2025-10-29T17:44:14.225Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. That's great. Yeah. That's good.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:44:18.144Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-10-29T17:44:18.545Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:44:21.904Z)

So that and what else? I wanted to talk. One is I was kind of trying to see how. AI market is doing in India. How our resources. I did speak to a couple of guys. I told them what we are doing and how we are formed and all that. So, I mean, this guy did ask me, like, how do you give the salaries? How do you provide the, you know, support, benefit and all that? Like, yeah, we are just getting started. We don't have anything of that sort right now.

### You (2025-10-29T17:44:57.025Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:44:58.384Z)

But we'll have a better structure soon. He's like, would you provide a laptop? We are in that process.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:05.425Z)

Y. Eah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:07.424Z)

Yeah. I think if we have to hire some quality candidate more. I mean, we have quality, candid for sure, but more experienced. Then probably will have to figure that out as well.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:18.065Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:19.744Z)

You know, giving the appointment later on doing. Giving some benefits and all that, and having proper structure of salary as well right now.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:23.745Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:28.944Z)

Just transfer at some random time. And that kind of gives negative impression to generally, it is late. It's probably five days later, week late.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:36.145Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. That's. Yeah, that's not cool. We need.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:42.384Z)

Yeah. So I think. Yeah, I have been thinking how we could do that better.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:44.385Z)

A process done.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:49.504Z)

Let's see.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:49.505Z)

Yeah, because we may have to go the contractor route.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:51.104Z)

I was thinking.

### You (2025-10-29T17:45:53.825Z)

For a few more months at least. You know, Maybe. I don't know. For a little while. You know, we probably won't have a payroll system and benefits or anything like that, so. Yeah, we need to nail down that process.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:45:59.024Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep. Yeah, but let's see. Let's see. I've been thinking about that. So let's see how that works out. I was thinking probably having something back in India itself. We have the account there. And probably register a company. That will make it like seamlessly. Then we can kind of do a full time arrangement rather than contract, because contract is again, negative thing as well.

### You (2025-10-29T17:46:36.385Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:46:41.024Z)

But let's see how that would work out.

### You (2025-10-29T17:46:42.705Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah, I think. We? I don't. I'm just thinking off the top of my head. That, that. Might need us to at least get to version one. Or at least some paying clients before we take that leap. But I don't know how much it would cost, what the process is, I have no clue. So maybe. Maybe it is something we could do sooner. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:47:13.584Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I have a person who does all this, like registering a company. I'm planning to talk to him. Let's say if he could do this for not a lot of expenses, then might do that.

### You (2025-10-29T17:47:15.505Z)

Oh. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. All. Right? Yeah. Be worth looking into.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:47:29.104Z)

Yeah, yeah. And what else? The other thing. Is Mark and Diane in better relationship now? Like work relationship.

### You (2025-10-29T17:47:41.585Z)

She didn't mention any conflicts during our call now, so, yeah, as far as I know. I think she was really kind of surprised.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:47:46.544Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T17:47:52.145Z)

At, you know, the fact that in the morning, they were fighting like, cats and dogs about using the CRM. And then when I brought it up on the call, he was like, yeah, okay, I'll get together my list. What's going on? Maybe Drew said something. Or maybe he just had to vent and got over. But seems okay. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:48:17.984Z)

And that that's how we want we want it all smooth.

### You (2025-10-29T17:48:18.465Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah, definitely.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:48:25.424Z)

Cool. That CRM thing, how do you want to move forward with that? Do you want to post it in raw? Sr. Just keep running with wherever it is running.

### You (2025-10-29T17:48:39.505Z)

Move forward with. Oh, the CRM. Yeah, I do want to migrate it over.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:48:42.864Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-10-29T17:48:46.865Z)

And you know. Maybe. You know, nobody actually has entered anything yet. I just have a couple of test data I can go through and delete. The database. It's. It's connected to Supabase on the back end, so, you know, I'm sure migrating everything over should be too difficult.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:49:10.944Z)

Yep. Y.

### You (2025-10-29T17:49:11.265Z)

So. So, yeah. We can. We can decide whenever you guys want to do that. Yeah, I would definitely prefer it to be in the InnVestAI domain.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:49:25.824Z)

Eah, Good. Sounds not here. Miss a plan for that as well? Sometime, but probably a little low priority.

### You (2025-10-29T17:49:30.865Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:49:36.144Z)

Cool. Cool. Anything else?

### You (2025-10-29T17:49:37.985Z)

Now. I think that's it.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:49:42.144Z)

Also, I couldn't reply you earlier. There's lot going on on personal front. But I'm glad that we could catch up.

### You (2025-10-29T17:49:49.265Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-10-29T17:49:49.904Z)

Today.
