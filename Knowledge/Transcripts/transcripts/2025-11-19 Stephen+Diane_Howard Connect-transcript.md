# Transcript for: Stephen+Diane/Howard Connect

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:30:38.471Z)

Hey, stephen. Hi, diane. How are you? It's been so long. Great to see you as well. How are you? Good, good. All my notetaker. Let me close my. Yeah. Oh, you'll cancel it. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I will. Give me one second. My note taker is going to be removed from the meeting. Hi, Howard. Nice. To meet you. I'm well. So we'll see when you and I know each other from years, years, years past and I I mentioned briefly, but I spent after I left C. Beren. I've spent the last few years working on my own and in a partnership with Howard and our chief technology officer. We'll explain this briefly, but on a SaaS platform called. I mean, yeah, called a SaaS platform for now called InnVestAI And it is designed to almost be for the hotel industry, what I would say deal path, deal cloud due for the broader CRE space and avm, which is very prevalent in multifamily. And Howard came from Berkadia. And worked on the RedIQ AVM, which is a big part of our story, which I'll explain, and then also kind of later start to bring in capex workflows and legal workflows and things like that. So, you know, we're following Harvey very closely on the legal side because they've had such great penetration with the big real estate, the big real estate law firms. Right. Including the hotel attorneys that we work with day to day and, and going on from there. But we are, I'm going to do the, the introduction really quick. We are. We've been working on this since February. We have asked the proof of concept phase, and we're actually in the MVP phase. We spent quite a lot of time recently on data extraction, so using AI for data extraction of hotel data from Excel docs and PDFs and things like that. Because what we're trying to solve, one of the big problems we're trying to solve is the manual entry. The pain of entering all that data into hotel underwriting, the underwriting itself. I mean, if you're an experienced hotel, you know, the evaluator of any kind, if it's dead equity, you know, appraisal, you have the skill set. Once the numbers are loaded to go through it very quickly. It's just such a painful process to input all that data. It's exhausting. Right? And we've been doing it forever the same way. So we are this mvp. We're finalizing on the data extraction. We have some really great success. We're over the 90 almost. Clearing 95% accuracy rate on annual data. And now we're starting to get into the extraction on monthly data. But I wanted to connect with you because, you know, the way we see and I'm going to introduce Howard in just a moment. But I'm just trying to set the stage is the way. We see this, the point at the mvp, we are. We kind of think of like a scooter, right? And we don't want to build it out from this point in isolation without real customer feedback on what they need. Like, we don't want to go build a Chevy or a Cadillac and come to you. And, and others in the hotel industry and have them say, oh, no, this isn't quite right. This isn't what we needed. Right. Like we're nailing, working really hard to nail the accuracy of the data extraction and then the pipeline management piece of it. It's really from a SaaS perspective that's not that hard, right? And then the AVM piece of it, now that AI is on the scene, it's really. It's mathematics, right? It's math. I mean, it is somewhat mathematics formulas, right? That AI is improving and speeding up every day. So I'm gonna introduce you to Howard and give and you guys can talk for a minute. But we have a half hour today, and I just wanted to set the stage to potentially, like, tell you what we're doing and ask a little bit your feedback on, like, if you would use a product like this. If you're thinking, it sounds like you may be thinking. About engaging other platforms on something like this, per our email exchange, and, you know, talk a little bit about what it is you really, really need from a technology provider to improve you, you know, your day to day life as a debt broker. Okay. Okay. So go ahead. Yeah. And I'm happy to have this introductory call and to give you as much feedback as I can. But I might offer, and that's to the extent you're comfortable with it. I mean, I could potentially bring in one of more junior team members who's actually on the cutting edge of or non, you know, who's on the front lines of dealing with this stuff manually, but also is interfacing with all the other tools that we're giving them. And, you know, and we are trying to move into, to be more efficient and a bit more automated. And so just for your own edification. I mean, we use a Salesforce CRM contact relationship management platform. That's. Actually, we use a third party because we're far too small for Salesforce. So we use a third party called Ascendix. And they, and there's a whole bunch of vendors like this out there, but they just build a custom interface that supposedly designed for commercial real estate that, again, is built on top of a Salesforce database. So and then we also use data providers, Real Capital Analytics, CoStar, and there's a new one called Capitalize which helps for they use AI and mass scraping of publicly available records is my understanding in order to and also other information that's available on the web in order to pair up truly they see who actually signed for loans and recorded mortgage documents and they find contact information data. So they pierce the veil of an LLC which is, like, incredibly valuable. And it's like the Holy grail for us to match up. Truly, who is the decision maker to the LLC that's attached to owning an asset? That's great. And they do it for the broader CRE sector, Right? And. Well, they do it across all CRE sectors and. I'm sure they're VC backed. And so actually, when you know, they have a really good user interface, it's worth seeing. And then, but then when it comes to the actual data that you need, if they don't already have it, you click through a request and they'll. And then they will. You know, they'll spend some. Whatever money needs to be done to identify that, you know, and turn the AI on that particular issue. And they're saying within 24 hours they'll have that user's contact information for you. So we're pretty pleased with that one as well. Great. That's. Great. And so but the for offering memorandum production. And that's the one where we're really trying to leverage some modern technology we're using. Henry. Henry. AI I think they came out of YAC Y Combinator recently, just closed on a Series A round and we were their fifth customer. And so, and, but, and we. And they liked our complexity. And so we have, like, regular calls with their development team to tell them what additional, you know, inputs and buttons and, you know, what, we, we help them to prioritize how to build their platform. And we like the fact that we have that degree of engagement and that they, you know, so that's working well for us. And so, again, I'm happy to. I don't know. I really don't know anything about your product, so I'm happy to brainstorm with you, but really, I'm also happy to make our greater team available to you to maybe. Yeah, I would love that. That's because just like you mentioned the group and you said, it's Henry AI. Right. Like their approach. This is our approach as well, is we don't want to build a product in isolation without client feedback. Right. So we want to be hand in hand working with a client. We're at the mvp. Stage, but as we start to roll out versions, like, I don't want to be delivering, like, a product that really doesn't have almost, you know, daily weekly feedback from customers on what they need. So we can be adapting. And another thing is our product isn't designed to cover all of the needs. Right. What we intend to do is, and I learned this when I was at cbre, is you're Switzerland, we're Switzerland. Right. So we need API integrations with RCA and others have. I mean, that's not an uncommon thing that's happening in broader CRE right now. I mean, we may have if you guys really like Henry AI. We may have an API integration and go, go to them and see if we can work with them because the part of the. What we're trying to solve is God. That God awful data like entry, you know, that just takes so long and is so manual and how do you tie a pipeline? Management, and then you solve the data piece of it so it's instantaneous. Pretty much feed it into an underwriting model. And then that underwriting model, which and truly, I'm gonna turn this over to Howard in a moment. But if you kind of think about it for certain, Howard calls it Personas. Certain Personas may underwrite at a very high underwriting level. Right. And then you get down to, like, the management companies of their underwriting at an incredibly granular level. So how do you almost have, like, think of it in Excel, like Expand and Contracts, right? So that you have one abm. But it, there's like a, there's a use case for brokers, there's a use case for lenders, there's a use case for appraisers that may be at a higher underwriting level. And then but later, we drill down and build out a much more, much more robust underwriting and underwriting integrations. Right. And so this is going to be with. I mean, like, to me, like, travel click is a. It's a big thing. Like, I think we have tremendous opportunities in industry to start to pull some travel click information in and do a better job. But we want to. I mean, we just. That's. That's where we are. So I want to take you up on that offer with your colleague, but I know we have a half hour and I've chatted, so I wanted you to meet my colleague, Howard, because he's. It's one thing I've learned as I've been doing this now, is I could never have truly understood the benefit of a. Product manager in developing what we're developing. And I was talking to Jim Alderman. In fact, we were. Howard and I were talking to Jim Alderman last week, and he's working on some things at Airbnb, right? And he's like, oh, my God. Like, I just. Airbnb has product managers, and it's. Like it's game changing when you see, like, what they do and how they build out a product. Right. Versus just what we do in Excel. And so that's what Howard. Howard is our chief product officer, and he was at Berkadia and worked on RedIQ. And so having that partnership between someone who's done it on the multifamily side and people who know it on the hospitality side. Is something that's been really helpful for us in getting to where we are. So I rambled, rambled, rambled. But so let me so Howard, Steven is Robert Douglas, and they are probably one of the best hotel debt brokers in the country. You specialize in higher end luxury, bigger placements, and your partner right. Rob Styles is technically your partner. Has been. And Stephen have been long time friends of myself, especially when I worked at Clarion Partners with Chuck Lee. We used Robert Douglas on really most of our very high end complex debt placements. And Stephen. Howard is my partner in InnVestAI He's our chief product officer. He comes from Berkadia most recently and worked on Rediq. He has been instrumental in getting us to the place where we are, which is an MVP on our product. So with that, I don't know. Howard, do you want to spend a couple minutes, just kind of really quickly talking about, like, the product management piece and kind of what we're bringing into the hospitality space.

### You (2025-11-19T21:44:33.405Z)

Sure. Appreciate the time here. As Donald mentioned, I've been in congressional state 30 years. A little bit over, actually started off in multifamily operations and asset management. Did a lot of acquisitions, dispositions, renovations. Long placements, et cetera. So have experience with the multifamily side. This is me to me on the hotels. But as Thera mentioned earlier, numbers are numbers, right? So when you get down to a lot of the valuation models, things like that, they have a lot in common. But I have been switched over to the dark side back around 2,010, 2,011. So I've been in the tech and the prop tech space with Real Page and quite a few others within the industry. And when I first talked to Diane, I thought it was very interesting. As you mentioned, I was with Berkadian. Berkadia had just opened their first hospitality office. And Diane was speaking with Jared Kelso there. And she mentioned that there was no AVM specifically for hotels, that we had a lot of asset management tools, a lot of revenue management tools. And I thought that was pretty unusual because I can name plenty of AVM models that are in the multifamily and other asset classes.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:46:07.831Z)

Forgive me. What is avm stand for?

### You (2025-11-19T21:46:12.125Z)

I'm sorry. Unmuted valuation model.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:46:15.031Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-11-19T21:46:15.325Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:46:15.671Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-11-19T21:46:17.485Z)

Excel on steroids.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:46:19.031Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-11-19T21:46:19.405Z)

You can. Kind of think of it that way.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:46:22.551Z)

And just. If I could just jump in for one quick second also is when we say math is math or numbers are numbers, it's like, you know, AI has a really great case study and actually running the mathematics of an abm, but you still need a person who really understands hotel data. Right? Like, that doesn't. Go away because of this. Right. But what you're doing is you're giving that person who understands hotels and who understands hotel valuations just a much more modern tool to do their work. Right. Because you're helping to streamline the data so that they don't have to, you know, copy paste. Copy paste. Copy paste, right. And you're creating essentially the mathematical formulas that haven't changed all that much in the 40 years. And we still use pors and pars and percentages, all of that. But it takes a person to understand what it actually means. And the person doesn't leave the equation. It's just we're creating tools for the person so that they can be much more efficient and move into this modern world. So sorry, Howard. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I just wanted to, like. I interrupted, so please, start. Continue.

### You (2025-11-19T21:47:37.805Z)

No worries. Not my apologies for using the industry jargon.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:47:41.351Z)

That's fine.

### You (2025-11-19T21:47:41.565Z)

And clarifying exactly what we were discussing here. The underlying data is really the big difference. As well. As Diane mentioned, there's certain. Key differences with the hotel space. There are no rent roles. I kind of like it to a combination of an apartment, community and retail because the transactions are just very quick. You're in and out. You've got multiple businesses within the hotel, which is something that you don't see in multifamily.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:48:18.471Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-19T21:48:20.765Z)

So, yeah, a lot of differences there. But as Don mentioned, we're really trying to do is to automate the process. No more copy paste. Right. Excel is a minefield of danger. People override a formula. Or they change a formula for a specific situation. Then all of a sudden they take that model, they just do a serve as and use it on the next deal and. It's just. A process that we can implement that. Is safeguarded from those types of errors and take all that manual process out of it.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:48:55.751Z)

He was born out of asking about the questions about the dream got his old hurt.

### You (2025-11-19T21:49:00.125Z)

So at the beginning of the call, Diane mentioned that we have. The uploading.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:49:05.671Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-19T21:49:05.885Z)

And the processing of the financial statements to where you could. Do some Excel spreadsheet apf. You can drop it, put it into the process. Ing, and it's going to extract all that financial data out. And we do have very high success rate now and want to get higher. And so in terms of creating.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:49:22.071Z)

It looks like a high rate. Does it validate that the math that the total. That the line item shown or meeting the total? Because, I mean, look, some of our clients have wide, hugely disparate levels of sophistication. Sometimes it's an export out of QuickBooks. We're just getting a PDF of a summary file. We want our analyst to input the data into our model and then make sure that the numbers match up because. And not that we're rooting out fraud here, but just sometimes we're dealing with gross incompetence, and we need to know that. Whatever's coming into our model is valid and that the numbers total up what they say they do. We not just taking the bottom line as gospel. So certainly validation of the math is really important to us. And that's part of why I like the process of having there being some sort of manual input is I get confidence in that. The validation is occurring, but please continue.

### You (2025-11-19T21:50:28.365Z)

Now. So in terms of validation, there are two ways to go about it. Number one, when we extract the data, we're only extracting the line items and not the totals. So we still do have the formulas. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:50:42.071Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-11-19T21:50:42.125Z)

So we're not just taking the hard total of the total line. Or the hard value. Second off we can create the values who did this at RedIQ where we do match what is on the statement that was uploaded. Versus what's in the database to make sure that. It extracted the data. But when you say fraud and validation. Is that what you're talking about? Just to make sure that the totals and the subtitles.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:51:13.031Z)

Well, yeah. I mean, yes. That all the line items are shown that there's nothing and that the and that the what is shown as a total is, in fact, the sum of the line items that are shown in that there's not something that's hidden or omitted or what have you. So, yeah, sometimes we get live Excel documents. Other cases, we're just getting scanned PDFs or even photograph scans where you can't where I think now the data is that you can identify and even scrape those. But, you know, and so look, at any one given point in time, we only have, we have seven senior professionals. We have 13 total employees.

### You (2025-11-19T21:51:24.925Z)

Ok? All right.

### Guest (2025-11-19T21:51:59.991Z)

We only have like four junior line level professionals who are importing data into our models. And. Yeah. I mean, some of our mandates could take the shortest one in six months. Nine 12 months. Happens all the time. So do a depth. Right. An investment sale and investment sale is shorter than raising joint venture equity. But once we do an initial underwriting, there is occasion for multiple updates, you know, monthly updates. We don't update more frequently than monthly, but to update date down the model for the latest trends and then to report back to us and report into the market. You know, what's the takeaway from that as it relates to, you know, the trailing performance? And I'd say we only have about. I mean, right now we have 30 transactions on our pipeline. That's frankly a pretty good number. We just would like to see more of them close. But that's the ratio of. Pretty good ratio. So it's seven, you know, it's five to eight deals that each junior member is sort of staffed on. Maybe, maybe it gets up to 10. And so, yes, we. Could use support for them to be updating our models. And things like that, or even for the initial underwriting during the course of a transaction. But I guess I'm a little wary about handing over our model because, look, Jared and I both came from the same place. We were at Samba Goldman together. And that Sonda Goldman that we created, the model that I know has been carried forward and sort of propagating out. It's a bit of a standard, at least among our small peer set for hotel evaluations. Of course, it's gone through multiple iterations over the years. I'm sure there's different than ours now, but it all has the same DNA. And it's not as simple as just par as picking the driver par or percentage, because it also takes into account the percentage of the expense that we want. To calculate as being fixed, and then the balance of it varies, so that's some theory. And that came out of hvs. I know. It's in Diane, you're nodding like you're. Well, variable components. We're building all of that in your experience at sonde, like, right. I've worked in so many shops where. And I've seen iterations. I've seen iterations that are very good at getting down into, like where you can choose in rooms. I'm just gonna make up rooms expense for a minute, right? Where you may have X amount of your expense be variable, X amount be fixed, right? And so that is our. We are building it that way. Well, having that. Because when you can play around with fixed and variable levers, in addition to picking to, you know, hard coding what the driver is for a por or a. Really. That's for por, right? That's how you get this dynamic sort of profit. Increase as occupancy grows. And it's well substantiated in the model. And it's a degree of nuance that is that take some time knowing how to run the model for our team, for junior members to get up to speed, but, like, it really does allow you to tweak. It in. So finally, and you know, and then we joked about it, east coast versus west coast model. And now we have, we have a toggle where you can go back and forth, but when you're arriving at a valuation, my west coast west coast scenario, which again, I learned at HVS from Suzanne Mellon. Right. Where you're inputting where you're inputting the exit cap rate and you're inputting the discount rate, the unlevered discount rate. And as a result, you're calculating the value and you're calculating the levered return because. And you also input the levered. The leverage assumptions, right? So. The outputs are the lever return and the value. Probably the other way. The toggle here is that you and I know lots of deals get done this way. And this is what we call the east coast model is you input the value. And then you're calculating the unlevered return and the levered return. You input the value and the mortgage inputs as well, and you. And also the exit cap rate, and you calculate the unlevered return, you calculate the levered return. And so for way too long, we had, we literally had two different models. That approach valuation from opposite sides of the equation. And now we've got a new one where it's just a toggle of, like, are we doing the east coast or the west coast way? We have that toggle, too. It's built into the mvp. It's like, are you gonna essentially run it? Like. Like your east coast is how I think about everything I've done, like at Clarion Partners and everything, right? It's like I can pay X for this hotel. I'm gonna run a. You know, and then what is the return? Is it meet my. My funds objectives, right? Or does it not and do. I just have to iterate and iterate and iterate till I get to 20% leveraged IRR versus the left, the left coast model that you were talking about, which is a bit more of like the appraisal model, right, which is you're putting in that you, you know, it's an 11% on leverage, DCF and this kind of, you know, cap rate. And maybe you're using some sales comps and then you're backing into what the value is. And we. Yeah. And you know what? What's fascinating, Stephen, is that multifamily kind of does it the same way. What's? Unique to us is that our data is just really. I mean, it's complicated, right? Our data is kind of complicated. And so we have spent a lot of time. Like, it does help that I came from the hotel space and the underwriting space, where I've done it my whole career. And so marrying Howard and we have a chief technology officer that also came from Berkadia and rediq. So Howard and Vinod worked there together, but we're marrying what they know how to do on creating an actual AVM in SAS. Right. With everything I've learned over 25 or 30, if I can say, 30 years without actually identifying my age that. Well, you know everything I know about hotel underwriting. But again, you don't take the person out of it. At the end of the day, a person has to still be there, but you're just making sure that the person. Like the poor sad person I've been most of my career. That's up at midnight or 1:00, right, reeing? In monthly data to get to a new trailing twelve. And their eyes are open, you know, held open with toothpicks, and they're exhausted. Like helping that person have better, more modern tools like you're talking about with. With, I think you called it capitalized. Right. And capitalized on the business development side. Right. And so. And look. And so with Henry, they're creating the book. The pitch book, the offering memorandum, the financing request memorandum. But we are just giving them outputs from our model for them to incorporate. We are not giving them raw data to produce, you know, cash flows and pro formas. We're still keeping that value add on our side. Through our model, which is. Which is in Excel with a whole bunch of macros attached to it. And so, you know, the data input to our model is, are the, you know, both historical and forecast trends for that CoStar puts out. And it's COSTAR narrowed from five years down to just three years of forecast or something like that. But they we take COSTAR forecast data for as granular and appropriate submarket as we can get. And, but we had taken into consideration everything up above that in the funnel to get down to. And then you know, in doing our revpar forecast. Right. Not only do we forecast annually, but we try to then back solve or also to consider it to make sure that our annual forecast makes sense. By taking into consideration monthly seasonality, trends, segmentation. So you can do segmentation shift to justify a large revpar. A large movement in annual revpar. Those are the two big ones. This is appraisal, you know, and you also have to, you know, the one that we kind of fall down on is, or would like to have incorporated is some sort of dynamic to account for additions to supply. And, you know, and then on the appraisal side, you have induced demand. That also enters the competitive set when you have a major addition, but also some supply is only partially competitive versus 100% directly competitive. But that gets you a more nuanced and dynamic revpar forecast, both historically views into the past and on a go forward basis. And then so once we have the revpar, then we're using comparable statement analysis. Of things that are on our files or third party generated paid reports like the host report or what have you. And again, we're inputting major assumptions into the pro forma for each line item. And, you know, tweaking that fixed variable component of the in order to get a pro forma. And then once you have a pro forma, it's a question of, are we doing the east coast or west coast style for valuation? We do like to get into debt and we do look at debt unlike a tranche by Tron basis. So yes, we think something might be priced at 450 over for a 65% LTV financing. But we individually priced the 0 to 40, the 40 to 50, the 50 to 60, the 60 to 65 tranche. To make sure that the blended weighted average cost of capital matches our knee jerk reaction of the end pricing. We're not there yet. Right. Because kind of like we're thinking of this, as Elisa says, when I was at cbre, what I heard over and over again is when you're doing this, build the scooter, right? Start with the scooter, or don't build a Chevy or the Cadillac. And so when you were talking about again, Like, Henry, like. We've been very careful. We kind of. Everything you talked about left the West Coast. East Coast. Right. All the fixed variables, segmentation, like, all of that. Right. And it's good for your analysts to be able to input it so that they can check it, but if we have ways to. Check that digitally the same way they're checking it by hand. Right. That can save them some time. And so that essentially maybe an underwriting that takes your analyst a day or a day and a half. Could it actually get down to a half hour? Because we've automated a lot of the inputs, right? We have not gotten down into the pricing or analyzing the debt by tranche, but I can tell you I've had enough conversations with owners recently that that's incredibly important. And to your point about the seasonality, I wanted to mention I've had so many conversations recently with owners that are stuck in cash traps because they didn't really adequately think about the seasonality, if this makes sense. Right. So a loan closed on a certain date where certain triggers are set on trailing sixes, and depending on when the loan closed, you're just getting caught in this hell of seasonality where you have these huge fluctuations in your cash flow. And you could end up in a cash trap. That was completely on time. No one wanted that to happen. Right. It was just no one thought through the seasonality and how that needed to get picked up in the coverage rate in the Covenants, essentially. So we're trying to think about things like how do we improve the problems as well by trying to create some automation and try to look at things that could. But I. Where we are is where I want to go with is this is the Chevy, this is the scooter, right? And we want to get from the scooter next to, I don't know, maybe the bicycle or the Chevy, but we don't want. To do it without real world customer feedback because we want to build a product that people want and use. And that is the hence why we love to talk to your analysts as closer to this and get their get your feedback, get his or her feedback, show you what we've got. And, like, we're not ready to come and say, you know, hey, we can sell you this product tomorrow at Act Surprise. But within three to six months, with good user feedback, I think we could have a product that you would really love and you would have been involved in building it. Does that make sense? Like having. Yeah. Yeah. So look, I'm happy to schedule and I have another 10 minutes to quarter after if you'd like to take it. But yeah, I'm happy to follow up both myself and or with team members to explore a little further. We highly value the relationship with you, Diane, and pleased to meet you, Howard, and want to be helpful. So, I mean, is there anything else? That you know or questions you have about our business or needs that maybe I could address. And some closing remarks here. So, I mean, from a technology perspective, is it that you guys are just looking like, you know, as a product comes out like a. And I realize Henry and capitalize are two very different things, right? I get one is more om based and one is more kind of like market, you know, really? I mean, going out there and trying to find the actual pierce the veil, as you said, that's crazy hard to do. And so if you have technology that's found a way to do that, that's amazing. But is that how you guys are doing it? Is kind of piecemealing it and then creating. I mean, are you guys. I mean, I guess you're just using those products, right? Are those products integrating with each other through. No. Okay. So yeah. Our ascendix is our CRM database. That's not. I mean. There's a plugin that integrates with Outlook so that we can update contact information more efficiently that not everyone even has downloaded. Like, but we're trying to continually improve our contact database through, you know, either through mass uploads or through validating with individual emails. But that's, that's one that's. And our Salesforce database, that. It's just kind of. It requires manual input. It's not integrated with any other source of data. The costar Real Capital analytics and capitalize all our individual and at this point no one can fully replace the other. It's really because Capitalize has doesn't have as good data on loan maturities as Real Capital analytics does. And Real Capital Linux doesn't have as good information. I would look it. I mean, look, COSTAR has the star Report data, so we're gonna, we have to buy costar no matter What? But costar doesn't have the private market loan data. That Real Capital does. Real Capital Linux is owned by msvi. They're big data provider and they've just been out ahead of everyone else and trying to track down loan data. But then a lot of times with Real Capital analytics, it stops at the llc and generally we know who the buyer is, who the owner. Is and who the person to contact is. But there's plenty of occasions where we don't, and that's where capitalized helps us pierce that fail. And so all three of them together, I have yet to. I don't know that I can do without either any of them individually, but they're also not talking to each other. And that's the West. What we want to solve, right, is that piece of it, which is a lot like. I mean, I can't say we would be a cherry, because, I mean, cherry does a great job of having integrations with all these, like, millions of different data sources. But for the hotel sector, what we want. I know that RCA and Cherry have an API integration, right? So if you think of us and best AI we have, like in the future, we have an API API integration with rca. We're pulling that RCA data in for you. We. I mean, I Again, I'm not familiar with the other platforms that you're using as well, but the concept is that we're going out. You need to do your underwriting into one common place. Right? We're not replacing a rca. We could never do that. We're not replacing a Capitalized. We're not replacing a Henry. But we're just pulling it all together. With the actual underwriting. So you have it all in one place and it's talking to it. Right. The data is being able to get integrated more seamlessly into your underwriting model. That's our vision. And it. And it's not a vision. That is impossible, because I joke. I call it the yellow. Brick road. You know, broader. CRA has been doing this for a decade almost, or they started a decade ago. Right. They're having great success now. So it's just there's no solutions in hotel. So we just follow that yellow brick road, which is a pathway that points to solutions around API integrations where we can for you pull all of that together with the actual pipeline management and underwriting model and some things, some other data products that I haven't discussed yet that we're starting to work on, which is their legal workflows with Harvey. They are capex and Pip workflows that we're starting to think about how to build with procore. And we're also trying to think about closing workflows, like closing a deal. Right. And there's a lot of involved with that and how you might digitize that process. But the future products, I think, will help make the underwriting piece of it. I don't want to say stickier, but when you put them all together, you know, our vision is that it becomes a really great way for us as an industry to step into the modern world where we're not living in the modern world right now. From a technology. From a technology perspective and in our workflows. Yeah. I mean, I guess something that just occurred to me is just how us ali standards for presentation of performance and cash flows and income statements are constantly changing. And again, our clients might be giving us data that doesn't conform with that. So part of our job is to reshape their information into that. Into that standard, which is how we try to present everything to the capital markets. And so that's part of the value add that our team does. That could certainly be supported through AI. And again, it's just that there's such a wide disparity. There's not an industry standard of presentation of financial reporting and things like that. I mean, Marriott's forms are wildly different from everyone else's and you know that. I know that from the benchmarker and CVRE and very confidentially, just because we're industry friends, is I'm actually talking to Mark Woodward because CBRE shut down Benchmark. Right? I mean, for Broken Hearted. I was brokenhearted when I left cvre, but Howard and Mark and I are talking next week about if there's a way that maybe it could be, you know, resurrected in some way, and then. Then you start to have, like, better in software benchmarking, right, that you could use for expenses and things like that. That's. And I know people like hot. Some people like hot stats, but it's never complete. It's just never complete. And we think, like, marrying, like, well, marrying like, you know, the way you collect data through deals and maybe like, a benchmark or product could be a really great way to create value or. Provide value for our clients. So I don't have a hundred. Like, we're just starting that conversation. But again, kind of like how you're talking about with Henry, where you're on the side, where you're one of their top. Your fifth customers. Their fifth customer, and you're giving them feedback. These are things that we're thinking about and just trying to evaluate what's highest priority for our customers. Second highest, what do they really need? And things like that. So. So with that, is it all right if I find time in early December on your calendar with your analysts, and we'll just start to go through it a little bit more? And again, it's not like I can. It's not like. Well, I'm asking, like, would you like. To buy this product today at this price because we have the mvp, but it's this user feedback that's really, really important to us. And I. I think. Could be. Could be. I mean, I'm trying to. I'm trying to be a change agent for the industry and push us forward because I feel like we just have not moved forward from a technology perspective, and there's too much opportunity and too much for us to miss. We don't do it. Well, I'll be happy to give you another hour or to give you an hour and we can take it from there. So, you know, I am interested in this. I do think the technology is coming and it needs to be adapted, and we all need to adapt. And I'm a bit of. I'm actually not an early adopter when it comes to most forms of technology, so I'm trying to pick my spots and where to get out ahead of it and. Henry is one where I feel vindicated. That's good. And certainly with the Sendix. I mean, we had a Lexus Nexus database 20 years ago when we were at Samba Goldman. So honestly, it's very similar to the interface. For Ascendix today, and I'm not really that pleased with how user friendly it is. Certainly. Henry AI though, is evolving rapidly and we are, I think, overall quite pleased with that interface. So, yes, happy to continue the conversation. Really appreciate you sharing as much as you have with me. I'm interested to learn more and let's find some time in December. Great, Steven. Thank you. Have a great day. Okay. Thank you both. Great to meet you. Cheers.
