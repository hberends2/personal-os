# Transcript for: InnVestAI product role exploration with potential strategic partner

### You (2026-01-08T18:30:46.452Z)

Good morning.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:30:47.892Z)

Good morning. How are you?

### You (2026-01-08T18:30:50.132Z)

I'm doing very well. How about yourself?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:30:53.252Z)

Not very good. Thing.

### You (2026-01-08T18:30:54.292Z)

Good.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:30:55.332Z)

Can you hear me? Well, there is no echo.

### You (2026-01-08T18:30:59.732Z)

I'm sorry. I have my volume turned on. Can you repeat?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:31:03.572Z)

Can you hear me? Well?

### You (2026-01-08T18:31:05.012Z)

Yeah, I can do you. Fine now.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:31:07.892Z)

There is no ego because I had another call before person was having some echo. That was with Zoom.

### You (2026-01-08T18:31:14.852Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:31:16.532Z)

Perfect. Your end celebration. Good.

### You (2026-01-08T18:31:26.852Z)

Quiet. Yeah. Didn't want to do a whole lot of anything special, just kind of. Just all around the house. I got a son who's in the Navy. And. He is able to come home about every other year. So he was here this year? Just a lot of family get togethers, a bunch of stuff.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:31:52.932Z)

Pretty much the same. I didn't get the whole family have two daughters. One she's a medical school that she was working for New Year and just before Christmas, so she stayed there. And that's the first year we spent without having all the kids. But yeah, pretty much same thing special.

### You (2026-01-08T18:32:18.212Z)

Sounds good. Going to school here in the States?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:32:22.212Z)

Now she's in boise. Hide. Aw.

### You (2026-01-08T18:32:24.212Z)

Okay? Stop.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:32:28.532Z)

But yeah, she started working in rotation the hospital. So that's why she was working.

### You (2026-01-08T18:32:34.612Z)

Yeah. I have a niece that went to medical school. I remember when she was doing all of her internships and everything else. They put in crazy hours. It's just unbelievable. How many hours you put in.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:32:56.452Z)

And that's just the beginning. For she's going to realize. That over time. But, yeah, she has a passion for what she does, so it's good.

### You (2026-01-08T18:33:08.532Z)

Well, that's what it takes.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:33:12.132Z)

And where is your sun base? In the Navy.

### You (2026-01-08T18:33:19.172Z)

Based on the uss iowa. Which. Is a newly commissioned submarine, so it's the Virginia class, which. Is the most recent invisible war machine. And they're based at the rot in connecticut. Is where that base is.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:33:44.212Z)

I was asking because you know that I mean, San Diego. And that's the largest Navy basin on the Pacific side.

### You (2026-01-08T18:33:57.172Z)

Groton is just submarines. And it's actually just a couple miles away from the GE plant where they actually manufacture them. So they're built there, they're lodged. There at some point, they may. Be moved to a different base. But typically, wherever their first assignment is is where they'll permanently be. A brand new submarine in the Virginia class. It takes a while for them to get certified, so they don't have any weapons. On board. Yet when they get deployed, it's usually for just a week or two. When they go out, they test it, then they come back. In. But. A lot of the military. Ceremonial type stuff. They've been going to a lot of those, so they're kind of like, The new shiny object of the Navy. Everybody wants to see it. So they've been going to more lows than anything else.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:35:11.892Z)

That's be cool. It's a balance between submarine. It's very special in the sense that you're under the water. And. That's kind of way of living.

### You (2026-01-08T18:35:32.132Z)

Yeah. They will probably be fully certified within the next couple of months, which means at that point they can go on full deployments, which are typically six to seven months. And the hardest thing for us as Berends is that they are not allowed to tell you. They can't tell you anything about when. They leave when they're going to be back. They're going to go. We keep texting. Back and forth who's got an iPhone, and so we know that he's deployed when the text level is turned green. He'll sometimes drop and hint for the shorter ones and you'll see, I'm going to be gone this weekend. Doesn't say whether they're going to be deployed, he'll just drop a hint. But, yeah, they get him really big trouble. They monitor everything. So if he gives any indication that we're going to be deployed this Saturday or whatever, Marshalled, and it's not the same as with boats. With the boats. You can see in and out. But when it comes to the sobs, the Navy. Is there any secretive about everything?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:37:04.372Z)

I guess.

### You (2026-01-08T18:37:06.212Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:37:09.812Z)

In the parent prospective. It's difficult not knowing.

### You (2026-01-08T18:37:15.812Z)

Y. Eah y. Eah. Y. Eah in the ob. We'll get used to it. We know what he signed up for. But yeah, you'll see. Enjoying it?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:37:28.692Z)

He likes what he's doing.

### You (2026-01-08T18:37:29.732Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I do have a hard stop at 2:15. I know we had a half hour on there, but I just wanted to let you know that I do have another appointment coming up, the secondary that I have to. Leave.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:37:44.452Z)

Okay. Not sure. No problem. So yeah. What's your feedback? Did you get a chance, I guess, to think about that? Look at all the different platform that I sent you, that is. I don't really consider any of them being a direct competitor. Could be a potential competitor. You have two different things, which you have the treasury platform that. Are horizontal. That are not designed. They are not purposely designed for real estate or property management. But they do have some features that come out across all the different type of businesses in terms of how you manage your cash, and which is basically the first thing you need to know is how much cash I have available every day and being able to reconcile with the bank. So that is common across all the different treasury platform and different type of businesses. Then there are couple. There are two where they are designed for real estate, but they don't cover everything. So it's none that will cover the full scope of what we envision, but it gives you a flavor of what it is.

### You (2026-01-08T18:39:10.052Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:39:11.492Z)

Yeah. I hope that it helps you to better visualize or get an idea of what we envision to build.

### You (2026-01-08T18:39:21.892Z)

Y. Eah. It did help. I didn't have a chance to do a very deep dive into. I went into the sights, I looked at their product offerings, got a little bit familiar with them, but. I like to do. An. AI assistant put together, like comparison matrix and things like that, which I've been working on in another project, so I haven't had a chance to get that deep into it. But I guess. I understand what you are trying to do. At a high level. I guess I just need to get, you know, what are the. What is the gap? Or the pain point that we're trying to fix. Now, I know we kind of touched on it last time, and I know you've got. The idea of cash management, treasury management, forecasting. But what specifically about that? Is are you trying to fix, right? I guess I'm not quite sure. How is it that much of a differentiator? Of what you're trying to do compared to some of these other projects.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:40:35.492Z)

So the first part, that there are different problems. That are, of course, connected. The first one is mid size property manager. They do their cash flow management. Most of the time it's manual or using Excel. So it's time consuming. It's not accurate, it's error prone. And that's the first thing that we're going to solve. What takes a couple of weeks sometime. With one to two resource, it's to make it real time. And so they can have real time visibility on their cash flow and bank reconciliation. That property manager, especially the one who are operator, they collect the rent, they manage a property, but they have to pay the owner by the 10th or the 15 of the months. So they need to rush to do that reconciliation to know how much cash they have collected, miners their market, their fee, and then pay the owner.

### You (2026-01-08T18:41:48.692Z)

Five.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:41:49.572Z)

We want to make that process fast and accurate. That could be a differentiator. So not only the first thing is why it takes resources. And then you can say one resource and reallocate that resource to something which has higher value than just doing bank reconciliation. So there is a cost saving here that can be easily quantified in term of. Full time resource saving. So most of the property manager can meet dope size. But I'm talking like, the thousand to fifty thousand dollars. That represent. The largest portion of property management or property manager in multifamily housing. Yeah, they have one accountant usually to do that. Average cost of an accountant is 70k a euro. So we can save that and bring more efficiency and replace Excel. The second thing is they don't have visibility into their future. You see all the delinquencies, property that are in distress, and the distress rate is increasing. And most of the time because while they don't have a proper risk management and forecasting, a lot of this right should be avoided. If they were able to plan and see that how much cash they expect to generate for the business in three months, six months, and run some scenario to assess the risk. To better anticipate problems and then react earlier. In addition, the profile of the property manager in term of property management in terms of revenue is evolving. It's becoming more complex. Revenue is not only coming from rent, but it's coming from other amenities. It's coming from ev charger, all the things that Internet that they are charging. So the revenue model is shifting and, well, they need to factor that we will be able to better manage their cash. And cash management is really the cornerstone of financial management. You have accounting that is looking in the past. The thing where you want to look at today and the future is managing your cash flow. And that's one of the things that remains manual, semi manual now. The last species, which is not necessarily a problem that we are fixing. It's an opportunity that we are creating. It's to generate by better managing your cash. You can generate revenue. So instead of having cash sitting at the bank, at minimum, between the time you collect the rent and you pay the owner, It's a lot of money that you can invest in I interest bearing accounts and generate revenue.

### You (2026-01-08T18:45:19.492Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:45:21.012Z)

They don't do that now for a large part because they are just struggling to do the phase one, which is daily cash and reconciliation. So they don't even get to the point of, okay, I have that cash available, and now what's my strategy to invest? Or maybe I'm going to be shocking cash. Then I need to anticipate and find ways to close that gap. But yeah, if there is an excess cash, then they should be able to generate revenue, and that can be a very high revenue generator. So it's really looking at the three steps where we bring efficiency and we save cost. Second thing is we give you visibility in term of risk. What you don't for larch part they don't do now. And that will mitigate the risk of. Distress or properties being in bad situation. But also to anticipate the risk that are associated with their renters. There are a lot of things that can happen during the life of police that could impact your cash flow. The turnover, the delinquency, the renewals, all of that. If you can factor off that. And then look at the profile of your resident and being able to assess. Okay. This president. They are bucket number one. All green profile. Perfect. This is the person who pay on time. You have the second bucket where the at risk. Because this start paying with a delay or they are not always paying on time. And then you have the last bucket, maybe the red one, where okay, this guy is the always pay with the delay. So that's going to re impact my cash flow and then I need to be able to factor that in my future cash. Flow forecast when I look at one month, three months and six months. So it's better, giving them better ways to assess the risk. And the opportunity as well. So it's a problem that we are fixing that they don't do. Very, very few property manager do that in a very systematic manner because it's very time consuming. And the last part, some are doing that, but not in a very efficient way. So now it's not a problem, it's an opportunity.

### You (2026-01-08T18:47:53.092Z)

Well, thank you for sharing a lot of detail. We discussed at a higher level. The last conversation, but that really helps to clarify everything. You said you've got a couple of engineers that you've been working with. How far along are you on this? Are you still looking on a proof of concept or are you beyond the proof of concept?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:48:21.412Z)

We are working. On defining now the all technical stack. So all the infrastructure and it's really technical design. That's where we are now. And from there also it's assisting how much time it's going to take to build. The MVP estimate that we have now is around. Three months. I think I'm a bit conservative, but three months to be the mvp?

### You (2026-01-08T18:49:01.972Z)

You come from the product background? You've done this before. So where do you see me fitting in? Are you looking to hand off the product? And you're going to focus on a different area? What are your ideas or what my role could potentially be?

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:49:23.012Z)

Yeah, so I'm really looking for someone who can manage the day to day on the product side. So it's really what I call my wing partner. So someone who is really working with. The engineering team and giving them the direction, supporting them, working on maybe building agent to do to automate the qa. I want to be and I want someone very hands on in managing. The all kind of the old development lifecycle and managing and being hands on in defining the scope. So now I think things are changing fast, so it's no longer. Necessarily writing specification. I think now it's more defining, kind of the prompt for the engineers and being one of the first point of contact, because there are all these things that we need to build. I will not be able to manage everything.

### You (2026-01-08T18:50:44.692Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:50:45.812Z)

But also I want to have someone who is coming from. Who's going to bring a second, a different perspective, another pair of eyes in everything we want to do. I have my experience building risk management platform for banks. And that experience that I want to bring to design and implement a solution for risk management for real estate. So it's kind of bringing. The way. Banks manage the risk associated to their financial assets and bring that to the real estate asset class of asset. It's very sophisticated. I want to make. I don't want to make that as sophisticated, but I want to use a lot of the inspiration of how we manage risk for financial assets. Different class of asset. It has to be simpler. It has to be adapted to the different type of analytics or data that are specific to the real estate. And for banks I was building along with that treasury platform as well. Then I have that experience in treasury management. The last part where I pretty have less, but I think I have pretty good idea. It's auto optimize the cache. But for me, I have my own experience, and I don't. I want to have someone who can be really kind of sparring partner and everything to say, okay. And not being alone in defining the vision, the strategy. Because I like having someone who can challenge myds and come up with different ideas and someone who can run with it. 's a hybrid role, very focused on product, but it's remanataging the whole product side because. I want to have time as well to work on. Well, I'm going to be busy trying to raise fund at some point. I want to work on everything around partnership as well. We're going to have to have many different type of partner for data, for integration, partnership with Yadi, whatever. All these things that we may have to put. Usually I'm looking for someone who can be involved there as well. And I'm going to be very focused on finding beta customer or pilot customer. I'm going to be more on the business development and go to market at some point and less on the product and more like giving. My vision on where or the direction and how you someone who can run with it. And while that's for the first part and after it's meant to be to have I don't know how we're going to structure the team product and engineering how it's going to evolve. But there will be a need for someone to play that role of this VP product. That's how productive product officer over time will grow and I'm going to focus more on business development side, but my passion is still in building technology so I want to be involved. Not maybe over time less really hands on, but I like to understand. I like to have a say and be involved in the direction of the product.

### You (2026-01-08T18:54:58.772Z)

Okay? Sounds good. And I know some of this has been done from the last call, but I think it's helping me to get a little bit more into the detail, just to make sure that I'm clear on what are the expectations, what are the goals. Did you have any other questions for me? For me? Nice. Ly.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:55:26.452Z)

I was wondering which rediqiq. It's a data analytics platform. If I understand well.

### You (2026-01-08T18:55:43.092Z)

Y.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:55:43.252Z)

Am I right?

### You (2026-01-08T18:55:43.332Z)

Es.

### Guest (2026-01-08T18:55:44.132Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-08T18:55:44.132Z)

Yes. Yeah, it is. A valuation model being used by brokers and investors. So it ingests the historical financial statements, rentals, and then the users. Putting their assumptions the capital looking at the capex required means basically forecasting for the whole period, whether it's three years, 10 years. Now. It's not. And it's not really forecasting cash flow for acquisition. You get down to the noi. And determine what the valuation is here. But it's a little bit different because. If I'm an investor. Or even a broker. I get that financial data from each seller. And that would be great to have an API. They only deal with the seller a couple times or once every three years. Right. So the cost of getting an API or connection like that. It does make sense. So, Howard, process is, you know, drag and drop. You know, drag the financial statements over, drop them in, extract the data. But when I started with iq. It became obvious that, you know, this was just a short life cycle where. You know, it only provided value to our users. During that acquisition period, bundled all that data that we're getting. It's also used. While they manage the property. We then created. Basically an asset management module, or similar to an operational management module. Where we can continue to upload that information. On a monthly basis. And then they can compare operations to their original performer. They can do revisions, almost like a budgeting tool of forecasting. Et cetera. And that's where we started to investigate APIs begin to set. At that point, instead of dealing with multiple sellers, we're just dealing with our client. Our Rediq user, that banker. Then create that API. Going back. And forth. But also what we did. Is standardize the data. So in multifamily. There's really no standardization. Financial statement. Other than revenues on top, expenses on the bottom, how they're arranged in between. Yeah, You've got your rental revenue, all the revenue, et cetera. But individual line items, they're going to have different descriptions. They're not going to be in the same order. So what we would do is be able to take those statements. And extract the data, but then put it into standardized format. So a lot of our universe realized that. There's an additional benefit beyond. The investment in the brokerage. And that we did deal with a lot of mid size and larger. Owners. That. Would farm out their management to third party managers. So just like you were saying earlier, You're dealing with a lot of different energies. And these owners, one property management company might be on yardi, the other one on Real Page, the Other1 and MRI. And so they found that they could use our tool to take all that data. Standardize it, and then they could then use it for their operations. Same thing. I wouldn't say they use it for cash flow. Because it didn't get down below the noi. Until. When we developed this, we actually did then add. Capex features down below. So we could process the entire financial statement. For that particular purpose, and that was very well received. Copy and pasting. And getting these different reports from different systems. And trying to manually get them. To merge. It was a nightmare.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:00:41.252Z)

So that goes for property manager operators who. Had bought for you across different pms.

### You (2026-01-08T19:00:49.252Z)

Yes. Y. Eah. So.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:00:57.332Z)

What's your experience here about? Do you see a lot of operators dealing with different pms?

### You (2026-01-08T19:01:07.412Z)

Now, if you're an individual or a smaller owner, operator. Typically, you're going to be on the same.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:01:14.692Z)

Yeah. Of course.

### You (2026-01-08T19:01:15.972Z)

But if you are an institutional investor. A fund. Anybody who is involved in the acquisition. I mean, they may just be a JV partner. But anybody who invests in a property that does not self manage. It's going to fund themselves in that situation. And there are thousands of. Companies that fall into that category.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:01:49.732Z)

Okay, that's more the asset manager.

### You (2026-01-08T19:01:54.372Z)

So they are heavily involved with the acquisitions. So they would use OneIQIQ to come up with evaluation. Work with the brokers, put in a letter of intents. Acquire the properties, but then have somebody else manage them. Make a B. 100% owners. They could be 20% equity partners. It could be anywhere in between. But as long as they don't do the actual day to day management, they could be working with multiple property management systems, depending on who they've, you know, how many assets they have, who's managing them. So the same thing is with rent rules. Right. So. In this product you're describing. You're looking forward, so you need to know, what is my occupancy? You're going to have to ingest rent rules. You're going to have to. Get lease expiration reports. Pre leasing and leasing reports. You want to know who's going to move out? You need to know the turnover rate. So if I know that. 100 leases expiring, and I've. Got 67% renewal, then you know you've got 23% of your property at risk. And you can forecast that way. But that's what you're looking to do. Is magnitude is more difficult than what we did at rediq because we had rebels in operating statements. But you're going to be looking for an API and an integration that can bring. In all. Of that information. You want to know what's the average amount of traffic? Releases can I expect over the next 30, 60, 90 days, et cetera? So there's quite a few different reports, and they're all going to be different.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:03:56.052Z)

But.

### You (2026-01-08T19:03:56.292Z)

Real things are going to be different formats. Everything.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:04:01.412Z)

With Metiq, you were only looking at the data that you were getting from. Er. So you have the financial statement? Where are you looking? Financial statement, rent wall. But all the data that were stored in the pms. Where are you looking? At other external data? Centers Information where you can see population by the profile the population on certain property. To kind of estimate, do some estimation of the. Get some analytics out of that.

### You (2026-01-08T19:04:56.132Z)

Third party market data was very important. We had our own internal data for my users. But wasn't really sufficient enough to be able to come up with a really good. Market. In some market data, so we relied on third party data providers. Demographics. Yes, especially for. What we call the Lifecycle Management Suite. It got into the basic demographic areas, but we also looked at school system ratings. We broadened risk management. What is the earthquake, fire, wind, all these different hazards that could affect insurance rates and go along getting tax rates for particular property. That's all information that you want to have when. You're buying a property. If you're going to put $50 million into the property, You want to know? Is this building going to fall now? Because I'm sitting on felt line, right? Something like that. We gave this much of that external data as possible.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:06:10.852Z)

Okay? Don't you think that there is a lot of similarities with the way you want to. How you want to forecast your cash flows?

### You (2026-01-08T19:06:20.132Z)

Yeah. Demographic data? Probably. It's important for the long term. If there's an employer that's shutting down or new employer coming in, and it could be a year or two before they actually start hiring or they're shutting down. If you're forecasting a 30, 60, 90 day or less than a year. Probably not so much. But you're going to want to. Have that as a reference point. As what's my long term prospect here? But. From what I did when I was with Law Partners and the others when I was doing the forecasting. What I ended up doing is taking a look at all of that historical data, trending it, and then looking at my lease expirations, my traffic. And making sure that I took into account that information as I was projecting forward. So a lot of seasonality in multifamily. Depending on where you are. Right. So it's not just a straight line projection. And the more historical data that you have from the rent rolls, from lease expiration reports. The better you can project with that seasonality out there. I don't even just know my average turnover rate, right? I need my average turnover rate in January compared to January of last year, the year before. Same thing with. Just the market. Do that. The market, occupancy, things like that. It will help if you've got a good third party data provider that has one sufficient data where they can actually do projections. There again. Most of them are looking in the past. Where's my occupancy today? And how does it compare to where it was same period last year, things like that. Not too many, actually. Project forward. And somebody, if the client wants to do that on their own. If we partner with one of those companies that actually do project out, that would be important, but again, That's probably more long term. Right. I want to know how's this looking in the future? And I could adjust things that way, but from actual just knowing how much cash I have in the bank, how much I'm going to need. A lot of those things are just. Too far out. And estimates. Approximately.

Now the. Cash or short term forecasting. That are pretty not relevant. Becoming irrelevant where you can be maybe. Then that's what you're with. But that's where I see something interesting and similarities. Lot of the data that you've been looking at. That will be relevant to use to forecast your capital.

### You (2026-01-08T19:09:57.972Z)

Yes. Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:10:03.092Z)

In this beyond six months.

### You (2026-01-08T19:10:03.332Z)

Yeah, that will something I was thinking as well. They said that conversation said. Yeah. I mean this, this could be a very strong real time cash flow. Like you mentioned earlier. But at the same time, all that information combined with some of these other data sources could help with budgeting and forecasting for the longer term, not just for how much money willing to have in the bank at the end of the month type of question. So, yeah, there's definitely opportunity for that.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:10:38.372Z)

Looking at the timing that you have, the unstopp. Where are you? And you're like thinking process. Do you want to have a follow up meeting or a continuous discussion? Whenever you want.

### You (2026-01-08T19:10:55.892Z)

I'll soon be looking to make a decision. I don't know. Are you talking to other people? Are you looking to make a decision soon? I'm not quite sure exactly. Where are you process?

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:11:10.772Z)

I want to bring that people, that person when I. Found the right profile. So I don't have whether it's tomorrow. Or in a month or two months. I can wait. For example. If that person is not available now but in the month of. The point is it doesn't prevent us to start now. We are starting. But kind of the sooner the better also to have that person. We are three now. It's kind of full time. We have another two people who are playing more like an advisory role. One was a treasurer for real estate, large real estate company. So trying to find the right mix of expertise, experience and passion. So I think what we have now, we can move on. But I'm more trying to be opportunist. Opportunistic in the sense that whenever there is someone who I think a right fit to join the data adventure, bring that person on board. But without again, being a showstopper, or if that person I don't find the right fit or the person is not available right away. That makes sense.

### You (2026-01-08T19:12:45.012Z)

I'm still very interested. And if we want to continue, I guess the next obvious question, and I know we're running out of time here, So, you know, maybe this is something we can discuss on our next conversation. Is. What are you expecting? Is this going to be sweat equity? Is there going to be some type of competition or compensation program? We can talk about those type of details. But let me go ahead and continue to. Take a look at some of those comps that you sent. And see if I can come out if there's any other questions that I have. And then maybe we can talk about the details at that time. And really want to know, you know, what type of time commitment are you looking for? So at this time, the hotel acquisition model group the number came with is still on hold. And I don't know. What's going to happen with it. I don't think that the co founders of grains are resolved their issues. So they're going to have to decide who's going to do what. I have been in contact with another company as well that would probably be a fractional or part time strategic advisor on a product that is similar to what I did at rediq, but nothing is. I don't have any contract or anything with them yet today. So everything was still wide open. So I guess.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:14:24.932Z)

Do you want to look at? Pick a time in my calendar for whenever you want. Next week is very open.

### You (2026-01-08T19:14:33.012Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:14:35.812Z)

And then we can continue.

### You (2026-01-08T19:14:37.012Z)

I can go ahead and do that. That sounds good. Let's just go ahead and set aside some time next week. Just talk details. Where we'll start with this. Look, in terms of a partnership as a strategic consulting, is it going to be a fractional role? Is it really we've got in mind? Let's talk about that. So I can see how that fits in with. Anything else I've got going on. Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:15:09.092Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-08T19:15:09.412Z)

Very good. I apologize to having the hard stop here. Love to keep talking about this. It sounds really exciting. I got to be honest with you. It sounds like it would be. A challenging and fun project to get involved with. We'll see what we can do.

### Guest (2026-01-08T19:15:29.252Z)

Sounds good. While we are looking forward.

### You (2026-01-08T19:15:33.572Z)

All right, Sounds good. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you later.
