# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### You (2025-11-06T22:30:40.554Z)

The dinner was really good. Pur. Ina. Cup. S of topping.

### Guest (2025-11-06T22:32:05.674Z)

Hello. How you doing? All right. Can't see. I don't know what happened to my screen. Oh, there it is. There it goes. All right. There we go. What's going on? Oh, there's no one else showing up. Was that helpful? Yeah. I just think if we can show that to the lenders, it'll feel very customized for them. I think that'll be very helpful. I'm here. No. Worries. A. Did. I responded. Yep, I think they looked good. You had one question. Yeah, I responded to. Trying to think of any others. If those are easy to add, they'll. Be very. Valuable. It sounds so stupid. That. Data gets loaded into our system all the time. That doesn't make sense. And people are like, can't you just put in a logic thing? And I was like, I mean, yes, theoretically we can, but we have like, 10 billion other things going on that right now, because we didn't do that at the beginning. We didn't put these pieces of logic in place.

### You (2025-11-06T22:34:59.894Z)

The pop. Up. Now. We want to handle all. That.

### Guest (2025-11-06T22:35:27.914Z)

All right. And. I mean, I guess we can just go ahead and start talking about this Marx. Email here. Yeah. I mean. Diane. Is supposed to review the llc. I mean, maybe I just send that. Let me respond to her and just say if she's not gonna. She doesn't have a chance to look at it in the next day or two, then I'm just gonna send it to you guys so you can all review. We can just get. That. Done. She just said she's a few minutes running it. Minutes later, okay?

### You (2025-11-06T22:37:22.854Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-06T22:37:29.034Z)

And what was the other. Thing. Oh, the safe note. Yeah, she sent me the safe note. I will put it in our files. She just added. Yeah. November one is the date. That's it. Okay, so. I mean, Howard. Anything else like non product related do you want to ask about? All right. Then. Just log into. The. Aging environment here. I did look over Mark, what you provided. Briefly and. I mean, Howard, if you haven't had a chance to look over, then I don't know how much we'll discuss. But I was thinking about. How to incorporate this. In such a way that it's not something totally new. Right. Most of it is not right. Like we add, you added basic information. Like any of the things that Mark incorporated here. Could. I think easily. Some of them are already in our, you know, create deal pop up. And I think others could, you know, easily be added. Some of this. Loan amount is already in there. Term acquired that service coverage ratio. That sort of thing. I mean, some of. Yeah, I was thinking more like. Like we should have, you know, every month. It should kind of recalculate. So that, you know, when the borrower sends in their monthly financial, it sort of flags the lender as to whether they're in violation of the loan document or not, so. I don't know if that was contemplated. At the end of the day, that's really what the lender is looking for, Right? They want to see the numbers are going to show that they're sticking to the loan covenants. Yeah. But I'm saying, like, would it automatically recalculate each month when new data is put in? Great. Oh, great. Well, I'm wondering if. Thinking from like a, you know, user, sort of. User flow, right? Like. If you're underwriting a new deal. And I know that a lot of it, like when we talk to Access Point Financial or other groups, like they have existing meals. That would need to get, you know, implemented, but. Howard Christmas if I'm wrong, but I think we should still think about this from the perspective of, like, you know, starting with a new deal, taking it through the cycle, like that's. That's, like, what we should be thinking about. And if something that needs to get plugged in, like. You know, an existing investment into the loan. That would be. Maybe like. Like, if something's trying to think about how we incorporate some of these things. Like the required debt service coverage ratio. Or some of the like loan terms. That you get. Like when you finalize the deal versus the one that you might input when. You're underwriting a deal with your own, you know, like your first pass. Hi, diane. Hey. Maybe. I. See pro forma. Okay? So the loan. Terms, loan amount. Interest rate, all that. I guess. All of those. Do get entered here in the financing? I think most of them. Do you have loan amount? Interest rate, term amortization. I'm just. Gonna pull this up. Here. Because I think like, the. I guess the one that I'm thinking about is debt service coverage ratio. That's kind of a. An output. That. You know, we calculate debt service coverage ratio based on the loan. And. The financials and all of that. So do we need to also. Like required debt yield and required debt service coverage ratio. I think, and Mark Day and tell us. Like, I'm just gonna talk here. So tell me if I'm thinking of this correctly. When I underwrite a deal. I put in my loan to value interest rate, all my loan terms, closing costs. I do the projections. And then, I mean, I guess first thing you're gonna look at is like, okay, what's my irr. Roi. Cash on cash. But you're also going to look at what is the, you know, based on all the projections and the assumed loan information. What is. The debt yield. What is the debt service coverage ratio? Because if they're too low, then you know that a lender is gonna be like, hell, no. Right. Well, are we underwriting now from the lender's perspective or from an investor perspective? Well, I think. I mean, this. I think we should be thinking of this from, I guess, a lender's perspective. But ideally, it's something that sort of works in both cases, depending on how you use it. Or depending on who you are, or maybe with, like, very minor, like, maybe minor adjustments, like hiding certain things or enabling certain things from, like, an equity investor versus a debt investor. Well, hold on. Just. I want to interject. It does make sense from the owner of the property in the sense that they're, you know, you. You assume or you get a loan. It's going to have. You know, it's going to have required debt service coverage ratio and debt yield. And if you go, if you break those covenants, you're, you know, you're going to be penalized. But I guess it's so it is relevant to an equity investor whether they're borrower. You know, or if you're the lender and those are the terms you are prescribing. I think that's kind of the same thing. It's a threshold. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-06T22:47:17.094Z)

Go.

### Guest (2025-11-06T22:47:18.794Z)

Yeah. So I. What do you think of it? It's for the asset manager. You know, we already own. Property or you have made the loan. That's when having the service coverage ratio or, you know, like the required DSCR or the required debt yield becomes relevant. So the question is, when do we capture that? When and where do we capture that information?

### You (2025-11-06T22:50:01.494Z)

Sh.

### Guest (2025-11-06T22:50:44.314Z)

What are we trying to use this for? Is this supposed to be a lender? Monitoring tool are we looking at helping ledgers underwrite future loans? Because, you know, what I pitched them on last week was really just having a system for them to monitor their existing loans. And so. It's less about modeling, it's just more about monitoring. Okay? That would be super helpful. Right? Because they're always thinking about, you know, what they should put on the watch list and what they. Which assets they need to keep, you know, more focused on. And, you know, ultimately we can integrate market data to show them whether it's a market wide issue or an asset specific issue. That's when it really becomes super helpful. You know, one thing we haven't talked about here yet is that my friend Stacy Naldoni, who crossed over from being at HVS to Western alliance, when I was talking to her a couple months ago, she said one of the most important and truly only important things to us is that it appraises like we haven't really talked about the fact that for a lender to actually do a deal, they have to get an appraisal on the asset, and it has to appraise. And somehow I think that appraisal information will need I mean, this could be a really big benefit is if that if we could somehow pull that appraisal information into the system so that it's live in there. Right. And maybe even the appraiser uses our software to do the appraisal. But that is a big piece. And when they're going to do an extension or if they're going to do anything, they usually either have to get a desktop or a full appraisal on it. And so we might want to think about just. How we pitch, how we think about, how our software shows that, manages it, compares it. That. That type of thing. Yes, exactly right. Right? They, they have to go hire Cushman and Wakefield or whoever to appraise it, right? Then Cushman and Wakefield sends the bank or that, whatever the appraisal and then that information, we're able to pull it up and like pull the five year projection that the appraiser did and. Also capture the underlying appraisal document with all of its mai blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that's it's official and stuff like that. Okay? All right. Let the. Appraisal thing being on the. Wait, you said. You said you don't think we can actually get like. This wouldn't be applicable to an appraiser. Is that what you said? Howard. Like wouldn't be able to be used by. But can I ask a question? Because at C Beren, the appraisal team used Rediq. Oh, did they use it for the analysis that went into the appraisal? Right. So we're just be distinct. Right. Like because they. So the appraiser can use it for the analysis, which cuts down the amount of time they have to spend on it. But then they still have their MAI requirements for how they have to format report, deliver. Right. And that's. We would never be in that business. We're not in the AI Business. Right. We're just. Yes. Generally speaking, appraisers want to kind of live in their own world and have their own systems because they're supposed to have this, you know, Chinese wall sort of speak. To shield them from any influences from the borrower or the lender. We still have to say Chinese wall? Or is it still politically correct? Or is that a problem? I don't offend anyone. These days. I'm trying to work in my sensitivity skills. All right, so I'm just going to go back to sharing the screen here. It sounds like. Howard. You. I like what you just showed that different modal. For the inputs and taking the user directly to the investment assumptions. That definitely is more intuitive. Than having the user jump around. Yeah. And then I guess thinking about. Yeah. I mean, capturing those. Mean, this part of. What we're doing is, I think, pretty real estate, generic, not hotel specific. So as you probably know this as well as I do, but. Yeah, just like, how do we capture these thresholds that a lender or borrower is going to. Upon doing their underwriting, they're going to calculate what they are. But then when they close on the deal and become the owner or borrower, Or lender. In reality. Versus hypothetically, then they're going to. They're going to want to track those metrics, but also monitor against a threshold. So we just need to think about how and where we capture that threshold. I think, like, even if doing it upfront, if I'm underwriting a deal, if I'm a borrower or a lender, You know, like Borrowers. Probably like Access Point Financial probably has a threshold for loans that they issued that they have to be certain. Escr, they have to have certain yield and they can just put that in upfront. And that way, if the underwriting and the assumptions don't meet, that they just can see right off the bat, though. That's not going to be the same way that an investor might be looking at an IRR or. Like cash on cash or something. Right. But again, I think we keep talking about two different scenario, right? One scenario is the initial underwriting, and then the second scenario was the monitoring. Yeah. How do we. Because on the initial underwriting, you know, oftentimes the lenders do is they take in the numbers from the perspective borrower. And then they assume that the borrower is inflating numbers, right? So they want to cut them back. So they're going to do some modeling themselves, and that's where the market data would come in handy. So. But I think for purposes of meeting with lenders day one, I think if we just focus on the monitoring piece. And then we tell them, you know, coming soon, the next 60 days, whatever the right date is, we're going to be able to give you a second module or second tool that allows you to underwrite new loans. I think that'll like. I think if we focus on, like, one thing and we get as good as we can get it. That'll be a more impactful presentation. And hopefully early December than trying to do both things well. It's just my opinion. I don't know. Just run a manage time. And if I could put. And if I could put on the parking lot for. To mark your point is you feel it's best to pitch the monitoring person and then say within 60 days we'll be coming to you with an underwriting module. My friend Kara Mon, who was. Well, she's been in the industry for a long time on the debt side, and we were together at C. Beren. We were talking to her over summer, and she said practically as a lender. When you're, when your senior. Right. And you're running a lending team that your analyst sometimes aren't as skilled and underwriting as other analysts. And so let's take, for example, and you're running down. It's all about downside scenarios. Right. They're never going to put an upside scenario in. They're going to run a million downside scenarios. So let's say that the analyst hard codes in that room's expense is 25% of revenue, and you're running downside scenarios. That could equate to a very wrong downside scenario. Right. Because you're not actually capturing correct flex and flow if the analyst has just stuck in 25, you know, like, like used it as a percentage in rooms revenue. And so she said one tool that would be great for her is to be able to almost have these, like, flags that came up that she could, when she was reviewing the analyst work. And the downside scenario, be able to say, like a flag, you know, you didn't adjust the room's revenue appropriately to reflect. And these are simple things, right? They just have it has to be a por versus a percentage. But she said, when you're a senior and you're trying to get through reviewing all that work, it's impossible to get into that level of detail. But that the analysts are making mistakes like that all the time, and so they're downside scenarios can be grossly inaccurate. Based on the fact that they're not modeling correctly. Do they? I guess. Would we envision a lender using our like this avm? They could use this to create different downside scenarios. Right? Yeah, Just like there's like. It's just like underwriting on the equity. You're usually underwriting upside scenario. Well, you're underwriting downside scenarios, too. Right. But to Mark's point, you know, Mark has always talked about trying to be able to have a tracking log or something like that so that on the equity side, senior people can see the changes that junior people have made. I think Kara was talking about something similar like a tracking log, so you can see what the changes the analyst made on the, on the downside scenarios, but that you also have. A way to test that they actually did it correctly and they didn't just. And you guys saw anyone who's modeled a hotel knows how easy it is just to stick in some percentages and, you know, run an analysis versus going in and calculating the por and doing it the right way to get the right flex and flow and things like that. Yeah, I think that would just be like, a new version of pro forma. Is that right? Howard Newbert and then, like, a change log, like tracking between versions. And please don't make into that I suggest. And we do that at this moment. Right. I just wanted to. I thought that was really good feedback she gave us last summer. And I wanted to reshare it. And then I guess, Mark, to address what you were saying, Is that? And the reason, Mark, the reason I was focusing on this, the investment part of it, the underwriting, is because I was thinking about how we were going to capture debt service coverage ratio and those required thresholds from a loan. So it's like either user input or. Howard, what you're saying. Like you could pull it from a loan document. And then I guess once we have it and the loan is assumed and. Or the property acquired, then. We haven't really gone into this a whole lot, but, like, you know, the. The operator is submitting monthly financials. Would that be like a separate. Something separate on here, like a report or. That just compares. I mean, we could, you know, you could update the avm, update the underwriting, and maybe that in some cases, I think a user might want to continue to update the underwriting to get the most realistic dcf, you know, valuation. But I tried to. If you look on line 37 of what I sent around, Right. Like, I think that we should, from an organizational perspective, show the five year pro forma. Which the borrower would submit. At time of loan request. Right? And then each year. They'll submit, you know, in November for the prior year. They'll submit a budget by month for the next year. And then we'll have to have some kind of tracking system to show, you know, actual versus budget as compared to original annualized pro forma for the same year. I mean, I think that's what the lender is going to want to see. So that's what I was trying to address in the long performance section. Yeah. I'm wondering. So I'm wondering, like, where do we. And I guess it is probably, maybe in multiple places. But yeah, like, you know, we're going to present this to the, you know, the folks at Access Point Financial. Right? Like, where are they? What's going to. What are they going to want to see? Like, like. Process is one part of it. Capturing the data. Another. But then, like, what are they going to want? To. Look at. When we, you know, presented them, I wonder. These things we're talking about here. Yeah. No, no, I mean, like. I mean, like, from, like a. Like, let's just assume that all 200 or 300 of their loans are active on here and data is being submitted. Where are they going to go and look at, you know, what they, you know. I guess I'm thinking, like, is this a report? Something that if at the end of each month there was a roll up of all 300 loans, And it showed, you know, which are performing, you know, like a summary, like, you know, loan X location. You know what the dsc, what the debt yield is, and maybe, you know, it goes in red if it's below the threshold. So there's like a roll up. That's a good point. Maybe some kind of. Yeah, like a deal pipeline. But instead, call it a, you know, loan summary or loan portfolio. Could you show all their loans on one? On one. Roll up page. Yeah, well, so. Yeah. Yeah, that would be. We just bought, like, a loan summary or something. Yeah, and. There's. But I think you could. I mean, we already sort of have them, you know, this manage columns. Feature. You know, and certain things. Are if you're a, you know, if you're the asset manager Persona or the. I mean, I guess you still call it an asset manager, but, you know, for an equity investor, whether it's equity investor or a lender, you know, you're. The things you're looking at from an asset management point of view are going to, you know, some of these are not going to be as relevant. Anymore. So you might unflag them and then add if we had debt service coverage ratio. And then maybe, like, dscr. I don't know what you call it, but, like, the threshold, right? As well. So I think it's just a matter of it might be something as simple as, yeah, adding those requisite fields here and then a user. Could see it very easily on their deal pipeline. I do want to mention that you guys know, like, Michelle Russo and chmorn. There are a lot of companies that are going after this. Just the loan monitoring part of the business. And so. I'm sorry, my computer's about to run out of power. I'm trying to find my power cord, so I. Do think it's really important that we follow up as quickly as possible with the underwriting piece of it as well, because that's what's going to differentiate us from a single pane, is that we'll offer the product to be able to underwrite the loan upfront as well as monitor versus just monitoring, which is something they're all going after at this point. Right. And Mark can I trick would be that we can have. We can tell the lenders that the borrowers could actually submit their loan request. Directly and InnVestAI. So that'd be a great way for us to get new custom users. And make it more efficient for the lender as well. So maybe the submission actually comes in. Through this. Is that possible? And I think the Diane's point, you know, I think to Diane's point, if we show them, like, one great thing, but then we say in the next six months, You know, These are the 10 other things that we expect to be able to do then that distinguishes us from the, you know, Michelle Russo's of the world and some of the other people. I hope so, because Michelle Russo is making great progress. I mean, she's got Trinity, she's got ks. She's got some amazing customers that I would have loved to have had. And I think she's a bigger potential competitor out there than my show of credit single paying platform is doing very well. I mean. They have, like, 20 customers. I mean, we have 10. Roughly the same number of hotels. From what I. I mean, a lot of her customers are hotel ab customers. Which is how they became single pane customers. I don't know what their, like loan module or lender, you know, debt module looks, but they're doing. I know they're actively doing it. I do know. No, I know. But yeah, I'm not sure if they're doing it for lenders or if they're helping like ksl. And KHP monitor loans because their platform is expensive. It's like, you know, 400, $500 per hotel per month. So if your access point financial and you have 200, 300 hotels. That's well over a million dollars. That's like, you know, $1.5 million a year. Which. Not right, and then I'm jumping all over the place. But going back to the pitch, you know, Mark, when we do this pitch and we first talk about, like, the monitoring, maybe you want to consider part of the pitch being a session where we sit down with their underwriting team and Howard interviews the underwriting team. To say, okay, look, this is what it looks like so far. What do you want in this? And what could we build for you? So they get the sense that, like, the underwriting piece could almost be. It's not custom built for them, per se. Right. Because they're a Persona. But that. That might be a. Good way to keep the string attached and be doing these informational interviews with their underwriting team so that our under our debt underwriting product gets real world feedback and we're continuing to have regular dialogue with them. December, you know, January 1st, etc. That's a good idea. We do envision doing that before the presentation or after? I think we presented. And then we ask to set up a follow up call where our product, our chief product officer Howard, sits down and hears directly from them what their needs are in underwriting so that we can think about how to incorporate that into the product in the next 30, 60 days. Right. That way we're not just delivering to them what we think they want. We're actually building what their team tells us they want on the underwriting piece of it. Ok, that's a good idea. This is just for the first few. Investor customers. Right. We wouldn't do that for every single. No, but for every Persona, probably. Right, because every person is going to be a little bit different. A new Persona. Yeah. All right, so how do we get from here to having something that's truly in demo? Format. Like, it's the 6th of November, right? And so, like, what. What are we gonna do? Are we gonna put a script together? That's what we talked about, right? Is putting a script together. Like, how do we do that? Yeah, I think we need to do, like, some trial runs. Of what we want to show. Like and how we want to go about it. So that there is. Yeah, like a script. I think that would be useful. Yeah, yeah. That sounds great, Howard. What is remaining in all these features? I think most of this. Is already developed, right? Is there anything that's, like, blocking for the demo? Apart from I know the Year Zero work is in progress and the map you send should be done by probably tomorrow. Day after Year zero should be done by this week as well. Yeah. That's one of those things that somebody probably won't notice until they start really using it, and then it'll quickly become one of the first questions. But when you're demoing, I don't think it's a huge deal. I think right now I'm looking at the staging environment. It's a matter we just got to keep testing, keep pushing. I haven't actually really used the underwriting like the future year projection piece of this, so I will do that. To see because all the. Screen here. All these pieces. These things up here should now. Be with these. Formulas for these cards up here are now active, right? The formulas are okay. Yeah, if there are formulas are active, but if there's no data available, there. I hadn't put any data into this. It's not gonna be anything, but that's the next thing I need to test. And as an improvement, we can always show what is missing for that formula. Under somewhere there, probably spread that out and, you know, show the missing values. And then user can always go and add that. That will be kind of improvement to the current form. Yeah. Y. Eah. And then. I. I did put in more feedback. Yesterday. Tuesday. No, it's Tuesday. So I don't. Okay, so there's a few more things here you guys haven't gotten to. Yet. So I will test. The actual inputs things the actual input sections here. And see if we get correct calculations for ebitda. Noi some of these. Metrics up here because that's gonna be, obviously, the biggest. Piece of this. That's what people are gonna look at. Y. Eah. All right. Well, I think we're getting there. Howard, do you have what you need? To address. What Mark was talking about. With the blender. Yeah. And. Diane, you know about the loan or the LLC agreement? I have it. I'm sorry I haven't been able to look at it this week yet. Before I tell you I might be able to get to it this weekend. I'm just not sure. So if I can't, I'll let you know this weekend, and you can send it out to everyone else for simultaneous review. But there's a. There's a chance I can get through it this. Weekend. I think if you. Rather than try to read the whole thing, just read that. Summary. Like. I think it is important that we also read the whole thing, but in this case, to talk about the key terms, just read the two page summary. Because that. 's, you know, it came from the documents. So as long as we agree on those terms. Then again, like it'll be very easy. For an attorney, my attorney, to just, you know, if we want to change something, just say, like, this is what we want to change. He knows that document intimately because he wrote it. And he can change it just, like, a couple of minutes. I think that'll be. Faster and cheaper than trying to, like, craft it ourselves and then have him review it and then, yes, it edited anyway. So I think that'll. Hopefully we can get that done. Soon. Okay? I will give it a try to do it that way. So. And if I can't, I'll let you guys know and we can start to go into it, simultaneous review of it. My only hesitation is when I was doing that work initially, that's why so much of it got redrafted, is because the original draft. Didn't. Couldn't handle the, like, changes in it. And so that's why they don't try to rewrite the document. Because that's it is, you know, very, very legal east and very like. You know, if one of us were attorneys, that would be a different story. But in this case, like, we just want to agree on the terms. So I think we just use the summary. And as long as we agree on those terms, Then you know my attorney can do. I'm very confident he could do the rest. Or his wife's paralegals could do the rest. You know, much more quickly and easily. Than and cheaply than it would be again if we tried. To edit the document. Right. So we can just say. My point being just like, we just focus on those terms in the, in the, in summary, I said as long as we agree on the terms, Then I think everything else. I will focus on the terms. I'm less optimistic than you are about how quickly and cheaply your attorney can make those changes, but I'll focus on the terms. And if I can't get through it this weekend, I'll let you guys know and it can go out for simultaneous review. Okay. Fair. I mean. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And then I think otherwise. I mean, I know you were. You. You had some meetings, like about the safe note. I know you. 've been working on Carlos. Tuesday at 5:00. So he's traveling this week. Drew, you saw I sent you what I sent to him, right? Which was nothing other than what you sent to me with three terms dropped in. Yeah, and like I said, I'm already doing the work, so. Yeah, yeah, so. All right. Okay? That's it. Anything else? Do we have the list of who we're reaching out to in December? I know. I've heard names. You know, obviously, Access Point Financial, we've talked to. But what is the list of people? And when will we decide? Like, at what date? We're gonna do the outreach to see if we can get them scheduled for early December. Yeah, I have a list that I'm working on, which I'll share with everyone early next week. Okay. Thank you, mark. I think it'll probably be, I think in this email I spent the other day right. You know, not with six. I mean, that week. So not next week, but the week after the week of the 17th. I mean, that's the last week before Thanksgiving. And so if we're going to schedule anything, we probably need to do it by the 17, by the week of the 17th, like, you know, reach out to them. That week. To get things scheduled. So we'll have to. You know, I think that that'll be our week. To determine if we're ready to proceed. And. And then if we are, we'll have to do some. Practice like practice demos. That week. Okay? Yeah. Got it. I. I question will we all be on the demos? Because five of us is overkill, right? We don't want to. Or is. Maybe you guys feel differently. Maybe you want to show that this is the team and you want to introduce everyone. But what's your view on how many of us should be on the demos. I think probably not all of us, but. Yeah. Yeah, we could think about that. That's. That's the interesting part. Another thing we should think about is whether we want. How we want to do the demo. And, you know, do we want to try to create a video? So that it's a controlled environment versus doing it live when there's, you know, just subject to computers freezing or, you know, who knows? Bad things generally happen in live broadcasts. And if we do a video and we kind of make it clean, Then we can always interject, but. But at least we have a starting point that we know is kind of as perfect as it can be. So we could just think about that over the next week or two. Mark. Is your list including customers and potential investors or just customers? I mean, I think at this point, for purposes of demoing, I was thinking just to go to lenders. But, you know, part of the sales pitch could be, you know, do you want to invest and get sort of a three month trial as part of your investment? And maybe we should think about, you know, do we go to an access point and say, you know, for X dollars? I don't know what X should be. You know, you can use it for three months because you know, if we get an access point to download 300 hotels into our system, You know, unless they hate our system, which obviously they won't. Where are they going? Where they get the upfront cost is so. So from a labor perspective, you know, just. Just going through that process and setting this up. You know, once they're in, they're in. And, you know, a lot of companies do that, you know, where they have a low. You know, I have this, this whoop thing on my wrist and I had a 30 month, 30 day trial. And, you know, I had to get my credit card in advance, and, you know, I got to cancel. If I didn't like it. You know, I'm locked in for a year, so I've got more data than I know what to do with. But anyway, just a silly example, but that seems to be a trend in the industry as sort of a low cost initial. But then you set it up and then you be, you know, you can't live without it. So. And that is a strategy that maybe we should think about. And so we published, you know, two, you know, two purposes simultaneously. Okay? Because there's. Yeah. Because I did just. I guess we can think about how we do this is from a technical perspective. Either Drew or Howard will need to be on any of the demos. Right. Because both of them are close enough to the software that they could actually. And Node could as well. But I'm just. Vanilla as his full time job, right? I just drew it for the demos. Right. On a technical basis, one of you has to be on each one of the demos. And then if it's a sales demo, maybe I don't need to be on that. And, Mark, you run it. But if it's someone we're going to ask to invest. Then maybe that changes, right? And they want to hear more about the story and the company and things like that and the pitch deck, which changes then how we show up. For anyone that's more of a safe note investor, I also think it's good to show that we've got, you know, five senior people. On the team. And, you know, I think as long as we don't speak over each other. Right. And we all have roles in the presentation, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have as many of us on the call as possible, but we can think about it. But again, I think the fact that there were five senior people working on this, it should give people comfort that were real, that we've invested a lot of time and effort in this. It partly depends how many people they have on the call. I always feel like it. That's true. Too. Yeah. Only one person on the call for it. You know, a potential customer that I don't want to overwhelm. But we're also going to learn from each call. So, you know, while we think the first call will happen, we'll probably have a lot of takeaways after the first call. We'll learn from it. We'll, you know, edit our thinking based on the feedback we get from them. So it's very much an iterative process. You know, as we proceed, we'll just evolve. Along with the feedback we get. We might also want to just have a stat out there, like, I mean, we've all worked basically for free for a year on this raid, and we might want to do some back of the envelope calculation so that we could say something like, you know, we have. Mark, you've said this before. I think you said, this to Dan Lesser when he said how we looked at this and said we couldn't afford the ROI on it. And you said it's, it's the time. Right. As much as it is the money. And so maybe there's some calculation that says, like, well, our combined time over the past year or. Five senior people is we probably have over a million dollars invested. In. What would you call it, talent? You know, technical expertise, Something like that. Sweat equity to bring this to market. Right. Because that's, that's not meaningless. That's a lot of. For someone that. It would have to start that today. That's, that's a lot of investment in that already. Yeah, no, for sure. And not just the time, but, you know, having the expertise to know what to do. All right. It's getting real. Yes. Yeah. All right, guys. Thank you. Happy Tuesday night, or Thursday, whatever it is. Bye.
