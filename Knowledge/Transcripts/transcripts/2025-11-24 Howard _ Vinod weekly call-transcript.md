### You (2025-11-24T22:33:58.120Z)

Hey, are you there?

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:34:00.260Z)

I'm good. How are you?

### You (2025-11-24T22:34:00.840Z)

Good, good.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:34:03.540Z)

I'm reaching home in few minutes.

### You (2025-11-24T22:34:05.000Z)

Okay. You want to just.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:34:07.540Z)

I actually had reached. I had to drop my daughter to math classes. Just going back now, but I can talk.

### You (2025-11-24T22:34:17.720Z)

You know, I really apologize. I've been totally sidetracked with my daughter. 's car issue going back and forth and trying to get that. I really don't have much to discuss other than what I've already pinged you on regarding the the requirements. For the lender portal and. The other. So, yeah, I don't know if we need to.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:34:45.540Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-24T22:34:45.800Z)

If there's anything else, if you have any questions.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:34:49.060Z)

No. I hope your daughter's car is restored. And says, Code with that. Running around.

### You (2025-11-24T22:34:58.120Z)

Yeah. She lost her brakes. That was.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:35:02.740Z)

Oh, my goodness. That's crazy. How can that happen?

### You (2025-11-24T22:35:04.120Z)

Yeah. Age, I guess. Yeah. I don't know. She's got. It's not that old. I mean, it's a 2012 Honda Civic, and it's not in bad condition. It's just one of those things where, you know, there's a hydraulic cylinder in the rear brake. That just. Broke. So when she pushed on the brakes, they just go all the way down to the floor. And she barely had some braking on some of the other ones. So luckily she was in a neighborhood where she wasn't going fast at all. But. But yeah, I had to actually arrange to have it towed to someplace, and then I. Had to go over there and explain what's going on and all that other good stuff, so. But, yeah, she'll. She'll be fine. Hopefully. Hopefully she'll have it back tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:35:46.420Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-24T22:36:04.120Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:36:05.220Z)

But I'm in this. She. She was not hurt or anything bad. It's his birth.

### You (2025-11-24T22:36:11.000Z)

No, no, she didn't get in any. Any accident or anything, so.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:36:14.340Z)

Okay. Okay, good.

### You (2025-11-24T22:36:15.320Z)

Yeah, luckily, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:36:17.380Z)

Yeah, even I am driving 2012 Honda Accord.

### You (2025-11-24T22:36:23.000Z)

Yeah. I mean, mine. My car, I've got 190,000 miles on it. It looks like new. Doesn't drip. There's no drips anywhere on it. I mean, the. The interior is new. I mean, if you take care of your car, it's. It'll be all right, but, yeah, things. Like that happen, but. Yeah. So she's. She's good. So. Anything else on your end?

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:36:47.860Z)

Nothing. Just been doing lot of work to, you know, do all the fixes for the demo.

### You (2025-11-24T22:36:55.240Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:36:56.500Z)

So, yeah, I think we are in pretty good shape almost of the things are stage. I probably just couple of things so that it be done tonight.

### You (2025-11-24T22:37:10.200Z)

All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:37:12.580Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-24T22:37:13.800Z)

Looking forward to testing that out.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:37:17.860Z)

Yep. And then I was just wondering if you heard back from Dai, and is she gonna be available tomorrow?

### You (2025-11-24T22:37:25.240Z)

I have not. No, I saw that she. I mean, I got a notification that there's a message on LinkedIn. So apparently she. 's been. Sharing some articles, I guess. I don't know. I haven't even had the chance to look at them yet. So we.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:37:41.700Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-24T22:37:45.000Z)

Yeah, we have that call tomorrow. No. I'll know more tomorrow. My daughter. Obviously the. The place closes in 25 minutes. They weren't going to be able to finish it completely today, so likely going to have to drop her off from work and possibly pick her up, which would be right at that 5:30. So there's a slight possibility I may not be able to meet. Tomorrow either.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:38:14.500Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-24T22:38:15.400Z)

I'll coordinate with my wife. If my wife. Has to go in to teach tomorrow. She's just a couple miles from where my daughter. Works, so she can do that. But we'll. We'll figure it. I'll let. I'll let you know tomorrow if I'm going to be able to.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:38:31.860Z)

Okay? Okay? Because if Diane is coming, then probably we might have. Some discussion around things.

### You (2025-11-24T22:38:39.720Z)

Yeah. I mean, it's. It's an important meeting.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:38:43.380Z)

Here.

### You (2025-11-24T22:38:43.400Z)

She kept saying last week that she would be on. On the call Tuesday. It's just, you know, last week was bad for her being in Miami. So yeah, hopefully she will be on there tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:38:56.180Z)

Okay? Cool. Cool. So. Yeah, that's just. I wanted to get a heads up from you. Apart from that, I think, yeah, everything is as usual. If about that thing, right? Lender Specific changes. I was just thinking, let's get everything in one go and then start making the changes. So that we don't have to go back and forth.

### You (2025-11-24T22:39:21.240Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:39:22.580Z)

What about Mayan Whatever, Mark or Drew once. And then, you know, we can discuss and close the requirement in one go.

### You (2025-11-24T22:39:32.520Z)

Yeah, no, that sounds good. I will find out more. Yeah, I. I'll try to coordinate something with. With the four of us. What does your schedule look like tomorrow and Wednesday? Are you going into the office? Are you going to be at home? Either those days.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:39:55.060Z)

No, I'm going to go to office.

### You (2025-11-24T22:39:57.960Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:39:59.140Z)

So it would be great if we can do it in the evening time.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:02.520Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:40:04.340Z)

So that might not be tomorrow, then? Probably the after.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:07.400Z)

Probably not.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:40:09.300Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:11.480Z)

Or, you know, one. One thing I can do is I can just meet with Drew and Mark, and then if they want any changes, I'll make the changes in the document.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:40:18.740Z)

Yeah, that works, too. That works, too. I mean, as far as you three are aligned, that's all we need.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:28.120Z)

I. I don't think there would be any changes because everything that I did in that PRD is based on what Marc sent and the KPI cards that Drew sent. So unless they miss something the first time, I would expect that to be probably 90% done right now.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:40:40.900Z)

Yeah. Let's still do that thing because. Just, you know, for that we don't technically back from Mark.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:55.720Z)

Yeah. Yeah. All right.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:40:58.100Z)

Or so.

### You (2025-11-24T22:40:58.840Z)

Let's. Let's just do that instead of trying to get all four of us on a call.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:41:00.500Z)

Yeah. I mean, it's okay if I'm not there. If it can do it, that's fine. I mean, if you want to do it daytime. Otherwise, even I'll be there.

### You (2025-11-24T22:41:09.160Z)

Well. I mean, I'll. I'll certainly put you on the invite. And if you make it, great. If not, you know, we'll record it and we'll go from there, but.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:41:12.660Z)

Yeah. Yep, yep.

### You (2025-11-24T22:41:19.160Z)

So, yeah, the prd. I'm kind of making it all encompassing for whatever's related to just the lender. So it's lengthy, but there is a lot of screenshots. So, you know, I. I just like the other ones. I want it to be, you know, these guys to be able to look at it.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:41:40.900Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-24T22:41:41.080Z)

And know exactly where this data is in the model and. And hopefully make it easier on them so. Yeah, I think. I think now it's like 61 or 62 pages, but, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:41:55.300Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-24T22:41:57.720Z)

There are a lot of pages where the screenshot took up the whole page, so don't. Don't freak out. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:42:04.740Z)

Just.

### You (2025-11-24T22:42:10.680Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:42:11.780Z)

Yes, I'm in a lot of, you know, just let you handle the car situation, and then we can sync anytime.

### You (2025-11-24T22:42:18.360Z)

Yeah, sounds good.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:42:20.500Z)

Great. Thank you.

### You (2025-11-24T22:42:21.080Z)

All right, thanks.

### Guest (2025-11-24T22:42:23.140Z)
