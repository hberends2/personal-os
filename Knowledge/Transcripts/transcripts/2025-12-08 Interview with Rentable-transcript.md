# Transcript for: Interview with Rentable

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:12.175Z)

How's it going, Howard?

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:14.019Z)

I'm doing well, Trin. How about yourself?

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:16.975Z)

Doing? Pretty good. How was your weekend?

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:19.219Z)

Wend was good. Cold. But good.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:22.655Z)

Yeah. Where do you look at it?

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:24.979Z)

Michigan.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:26.175Z)

Michigan.

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:27.699Z)

Just on the north side of Grand Rapids.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:30.415Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:31.779Z)

30 minutes from the lake. And we get all that lake effect snow here.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:33.855Z)

O. Kay. Yeah. That makes sense. Why, it'd be cold for sure.

### You (2025-12-08T20:03:42.259Z)

Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does have an effect on it, that's for sure. So you're out in Utah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:03:46.735Z)

Very cool. I am. So I don't know how similar the weather is, but it is been strangely warm. I actually walked out yesterday. In the sun and then sat in my backyard and got a little bit of sun. So it is. It's been like a weird weather for us for sure.

### You (2025-12-08T20:04:02.899Z)

Very. Yeah, I lived in Denver for a couple years. It's very similar. But no, I was actually looking at your LinkedIn profile and I see we have quite a bit in common, that you spent quite a few years at Can Service.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:04:20.575Z)

Yeah, I saw Conservatives was my first. I actually worked out through college, and then I was. It was my first product job.

### You (2025-12-08T20:04:24.819Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:04:27.615Z)

Actually.

### You (2025-12-08T20:04:27.779Z)

Yep, yep. Well, I've. I've known Jerry Davis for about 25 years, and I was actually a conservist client.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:04:34.495Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-08T20:04:38.099Z)

And probably left about the time just before you joined is when I moved into product management. And I was with aum, nwp and real page utility management while you were at can service. And new, of course. Jerry. Henry Nicaragi. David Jenkins. We used to talk a lot. I saw you. Steve Bell. As a common connection.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:05:06.495Z)

Yep. Yeah. Yeah, I was.

### You (2025-12-08T20:05:09.299Z)

Good company. Good company.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:05:11.215Z)

Yeah, I was pretty early on can service, and so we.

### You (2025-12-08T20:05:13.379Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:05:15.455Z)

I left a couple products with them. I've worked really closely with Dave Jenkins. Jerry worked quite a bit with on stuff. Matt Miller worked very closely with Matt Miller, Tanner Wade. All those folks, so would you. You were a PM for them, is that right?

### You (2025-12-08T20:05:30.739Z)

Yeah, briefly. Right at the. Right when Covid was starting to let up and people were starting to hire. It was a. It was a really good job. I worked with. A lot of people in the student housing side. And also with Chris. Oh, boy. Now, his last name. Excuse me. He's with Graystar now, but on the ESG sustainability. Worked there, but, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:06:02.015Z)

Okay? Well, cool. Let me. I'll introduce myself a little bit. I'd love to go a little bit deeper into your experience, but so a little bit about me, Trent Riddle. So I have Ben at apartment IQ now for three months. A little over three months. But I have been in product closer to 15ish years. So at Conservative, I was an analyst, but I spent most of my time, like, working with the developers, building out a lot of the internal tooling, and then I worked on external products. And then I was actually the first PM at Conservatives ever. And so that was fun. Then moved into health and fitness for several years doing personalization and growth related product management. I was in banking and FinTech for about five, about six years. Doing things like that. And so just around kind of AI and data and visualizations and all that. So overall, I've done product most of my career, and I love it. And Ben here for three months, and we are just killing it. Like, this is actually a great time to join the company. They've been very successful with a couple of their products, and we're launching two more. And the product market fit has been incredible, like, we're growing substantially.

### You (2025-12-08T20:07:17.379Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:07:17.935Z)

So that's kind of the precipice of this conversation, is we're looking for PMS to kind of scale up the organization. The reporting and building out additional products. So here in Utah, I have three kids. And unlike the western southern west side of Utah, Eagle Mountain, Utah. But that's mean in a nutshell.

### You (2025-12-08T20:07:40.179Z)

Very good. Yeah. Thank you for taking the time to talk. And, yeah, I had a really good conversation last week with Ashley, and I know it was just a screening call. But we did talk about the fact that the apartment IQ is starting a couple new projects like you mentioned. She didn't say the names of them, but she did mention one of them was related to multifamily investments and everything. And so I thought we kind of joked around, but it's like my background fit so perfectly with what she was describing. I was really excited after that call, so. So, yeah, what would you. How. How would you want to start off here? You want me to.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:08:24.335Z)

Yeah, let's. Let's kick it off. I'd love to go. I mean, I see your resume here, but maybe give me your career journey. Like, kind of walk me through your experience and maybe touch on the more relevant points. Like, Radix is obviously probably what you're referring to is, like, relevant. Experience. And other things like that, but let them know a little bit more about your journey.

### You (2025-12-08T20:08:40.659Z)

Yeah, yeah. My entire career, really, has been in commercial real estate, multifamily, specifically. Worked in property operations and asset management. And worked a lot in acquisitions, renovations. And that's how I met Jerry Davis. I was vice president of asset management at BH Management Services. And at the time, we were looking to implement the utility management system. And jerry was with nwp at the time. And I ended up implementing that with the full energy management, which was at that time, energy management, just bill processing and bill pay on top of resident billing. At the time was the largest portfolio in the country to do so, and therefore, you know, kind of a groundbreaker on that. But I also had a very, very strong analytical bent, where I had a reputation as having a strong Budgeting, Financial Review, etc. And so at the time, I was in Dallas and had a few contacts at RealPage, and they reached out and asked if I would be willing to join them to help with one of their analytical projects. They wanted to create what they called at the time, central reporting. Which was the very first attempt at a consolidated database. And managing, reporting and analytics across all of their products. And there's. I'm sure you're familiar with RealPage. Their entire business plan is growth through acquisition. They don't develop anything in house, you know? They'll tweak and fine tune after they buy them. But because of that, every single product was literally a separate business center. All of their data was siloed. And so we. We did put together consolidated reporting. But the most important thing was that that's kind of where I got bit by the tech bug. So kind of transitioned over to. To the product management side, and I think my first official product management job. Outside of helping Real Page with the central reporting was with AUM and worked there for many years, put together their analytics system for their energy management and also consolidated a lot of the. Private reports, we would say, or the custom reports for the management property or management companies that we were working with. They had basically given me an ultimatum to either move to Chicago or find another position. And moving wasn't. Moving wasn't an option. And so, yeah, they hired a new COO who did not work well. With remote. Me and my entire team, or the people that hired me, were remote. They were let go. I actually managed to hang on another 18 months beyond them, so put in a good amount of time there. And then after my non compete burned off, joined nwp. That was on February 1st of 2016. And on February 10th, real page by WP. So back to NWP a year later. Real page bot Aum. So there we were, all one big happy family. We used to joke around that, you know, I should just bring in my resume and see who they're going to buy next anyone who my past employers so but yeah ever since yeah 2011 so going on 15 years I've been in product management. And then in 2020, I joined Conservis. But because of the pandemic, it really was a step back from what I was doing in terms of responsibility. You know, I had quite a few direct reports at RealPage, oversaw a large organization, not only the utility, Billy, or not the utility management, the payments side, but business intelligence, ESG and sustainability as well. And so When I moved to Conservis, it was just myself, right? Reporting to them. And it was pretty drastic pay cut, so. Which is why I was not there for very long. So while I was there, I was recruited by RedIQ and seemed like a perfect fit because RedIQ is going back to my property. Asset management days, renovation acquisition. If you're not familiar with them, they are a multifamily underwriting tool. Where they gather rent rolls, operating statements. We used machine learning, OCR and all these other things to extract the data. Normalize it, put it in standard format, and then the clients would use that to evaluate their properties and come up with the valuation. While there, I did have direct reports on there. Kind of brought me back up to a similar level that I wasn't real Page. And one of the things I was responsible for is. After I joined, we created an entirely new product line, which was called Lifecycle. Management suite. Because I realized that most of the data and all of the information that they were collecting for the acquisition. Was data that they could use throughout the entire lifecycle of the asset. Previously with rediq. If you're an investor, you find a deal. You use RedIQ to determine what you think that's worth. And then you put in an offer, and you either buy the property or not. And either way, you're done with Rediq until the next deal comes along. So this expanded the usage of rediq all the way from the acquisition to the disposition and everything in between. We also led the expansion into single family rentals. And student housing. I was also heavily involved with the organization at large. Rediq was owned by Berkadia. If you're not familiar with them, they're the largest multifamily brokerage, underwriting and mortgage servicing company. So Rediq was just a tiny drop in this big Berkadia bucket. But they were trying to operate Product Management. The same whether it was Rediq with an external B2B product, or whether it was all the other teams which were creating internal products for Berkadia Wanted to run them the same, and we couldn't do that. Apple Norges. So I was also heavily involved with an internal team to try to determine which process to use. They were very heavily involved with Safe Agile, and everything was very linear, ticking off the boxes before he moved on. And I was able to introduce a new process there that was adopted by the entire organization that was more product led growth than it was safe agile. So a lot of different projects, a lot of different things going on there. And then In August of 2024, Brokadius sold Rediq to Radnics, which we thought at the time was going to be the perfect partnership. Because Radix had all this data that they were getting from multifamily operators. And we had all this data from the acquisition side, including forward looking data. So when you're underwriting a deal, you are making certain assumptions as to what is the rent growth going to be over the next three, five, ten years. What do I think I can sell this for? But unfortunately, the timing was really bad. Radix was up to their eyeballs in the real page class action lawsuit. Indirectly, of course, not directly. And what they ended up doing is. They took all of the engineers and moved them over to the Radix side because they were going to do a complete pivot of their product. Which left me with a skeleton crew at rediq, essentially keeping the lights on. We weren't able to move forward. We had no really anything in the backlog. Other than helping Radix keep that up. In January. The CEO of Radix, founder is from Kosovo, and we have a very large team of engineers, product owners, everybody in Kosovo. So he basically just about shut down Rediq. It's still there today, but again, it's just hanging on by a thread. And all of the development is offshored in there. So myself, along with nine other people, which doesn't sound like a large number, but it was almost. I think we had like 15, 16 people altogether that were strictly rediq. So they kept one engineer. One client services person and three from the sales team. Everybody else was let go at that time. So that's my experience up until January. And since then I've been doing some consulting. I'm working, actually wrapping up by the end of this year, a project with a hospitality group that is basically trying to create a valuation model for hotels. Nothing like it exists in that particular asset group. So been working on that few little side projects. And here I am. And my apologies if you wanted a really brief. I know I tend to get into the weeds a little bit.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:20:15.295Z)

No, no, that was great. Thanks for going through it.

### You (2025-12-08T20:20:16.179Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:20:17.535Z)

How did you find department iq? I'm curious.

### You (2025-12-08T20:20:21.939Z)

You know, because I've been working with this other organization. I really haven't been. Looking for other opportunities that much. Over the past year, I've kind of cherry picked and I just happened to come across the ad. I believe it was probably on indeed. And I thought, wow, that sounds pretty exciting. And so I signed in the resume.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:20:48.415Z)

Okay, cool.

### You (2025-12-08T20:20:49.619Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:20:50.575Z)

Well, I'm going to jump into a couple of questions. Some of these are very basic, so just bear with me. There's a point. But I want to just kind of dig into, like, how you approach product management.

### You (2025-12-08T20:20:52.339Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:21:01.215Z)

Your. Your process, your. Your experience. So my first question, very basic question is, is what do you like if you were to define the role of product manager? What would that be? How would you define the role of a product manager?

### You (2025-12-08T20:21:14.979Z)

I think the product manager, in a nutshell, is the person who is responsible to work. With stakeholders, internal and external. And determine what the pain points are and fix those pain points. Along the same lines. You're always on the lookout for new product lines that are complementary to what you're working on. And really focused on the revenue and making sure that everything is aligned with. The business, right? Not going out and thinking this would be cool, but it has nothing to do with what your business is doing. So I guess, yeah, in a nutshell, I guess if I were to just put it very concisely, work with the clients, work with the internal stakeholders, find out what their pain points are, fix those pain points. And come up with enhancements and other value added products that align with your business.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:22:23.215Z)

Cool. I like that. Sometimes product management isn't always appreciated. Or they get a bad rap. Why do you think that is? Why do you think product management sometimes doesn't quite get the recognition they might want or.

### You (2025-12-08T20:22:38.259Z)

I think a lot of times we're viewed as a roadblock. Where you've got. And I hate to pick on the sales team, but they're such an easy target. They'll talk to a client. Client says it would be great if we could have this, and then the sales team wants it right away. Right. If Graystar asks, Graystar gets right. And I think a lot of times product management is viewed as an unnecessary block to just keep on chugging out all these features that are asked for by the clients. Just basically becoming a product factory. But I also think. That it really depends on the product manager as well. Right. So, yeah, you could be a roadblock. But a lot of times that roadblock can be. Explained away in such a way that, you know, the sales team gets it or the client services team or whoever. You know, as long as you are clear on why you might be delaying or why you might be saying no. I've never really had any issues. You know, I can say that I've never had a bad relationship with anybody on the sales team or any of the stakeholders. Never had a contentious situation because it's to me. I don't know if I'm just good at it or if it just. To me, it just makes sense. To work with the team, get all of the information you can, and then determine whether that feature is applicable only to one client or can it be used by all clients? And then determine, you know, how. Important, is it? What's the prioritization? And then just be perfectly honest with the team involved and work back and forth. Never been a big deal, really.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:24:55.535Z)

Okay, cool. I like that. So you can take a trigger. Let's go into a little bit about your background. Can you tell what is the last feature you should.

### You (2025-12-08T20:25:10.099Z)

The last feature that we shipped was the student housing. Feature at runiq. It was unfortunate timing because we were working on a feature that would have been groundbreaking. And would have been bringing in tremendous revenue had we had the opportunity to finish it before. Everything was shut down. But. The lifecycle management suite that I mentioned was a very, very large project. That took a year and a half, and of course, we were releasing features along with that. The last one that we released in addition to the student housing, I mean, they were basically in the same sprint where we completed was also we added demographic data into rediq. So rather than just having historic occupancy, rent roll data and financial data, we also then added demographic data, which also include risk, like, you know, what is the fire risk or the earthquake risk or, you know, this type of data that an investor would need in order to factor that into their investment. So that one we worked on quite a while. Berkadia had a brilliant data science team that I worked hand in hand with them to come up with a product. Design it and eventually implement it.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:26:54.735Z)

Was that. What was the kind of the genesis of that idea? Was that something that you thought up of? Did it come from leadership? Walked me through.

### You (2025-12-08T20:27:00.019Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:27:00.735Z)

That.

### You (2025-12-08T20:27:00.899Z)

Yeah. One of the things I really loved is I was basically given. All the rope I needed when it came to the asset management suite, because it's what I did for years. Had a lot of contacts in there. And so that is something that I always wanted to include in that suite as part of the overall project, because I realized it's not only during the acquisition, but anytime during the product life cycle. You know, if all of a sudden you see employment drop or opposite, you get a new employer coming in and you've got all these jobs. It's going to affect how you run the asset. And so, you know, we worked very closely with that. Berkadia had something similar, but it was really focused on their brokers. What do they need in order to get listings and sell? So we were able to take that and make some adjustments for what? A multifamily investor and owner. Needs in order to operate the deal.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:28:13.615Z)

Okay. And so that was. Was it coming from. Was that kind of your idea, essentially, like, viewing what they had and then, like, trying.

### You (2025-12-08T20:28:15.139Z)

Yeah. It was my idea that I had originated based on my prior experience. But we did have a lot of clients that were part of the focus group that we would put together. So we did have our clients involved. It wasn't just me running with it and making all the decisions. So Rediq had even though they were owned by Berkadia, we had jll, cbre, Walker and Dunlop. All the major brokers were users of Rediq on all the way down to the little mom and pop single investors. So we did have a sweet spot there, both right in the middle, where we had a lot of organizations that were medium sized that did their own acquisitions and ran the properties or had the asset management. And we also had the institutional players. So I had many conversations with those groups. And a pretty robust roadmap that we were able to complete for that project.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:29:31.215Z)

Okay? And then you said it took a year and a half to build out the. What was like, the total time of, like, from idea to, like, getting something in the market.

### You (2025-12-08T20:29:42.259Z)

From beginning to end. It was about two years. That took that amount of time. But that was one of the things that we had to do. We had to make a lot of changes to the back end. To accommodate data that came in after the acquisition because our product was geared towards what does it take to buy a property? So we had to make a few minor changes on the back end to say, okay, well, now we're going to be uploading this information every month. Not just one time. And we also had to add these different UI ux. So, of course, it wasn't just me. We had the designers, had the architects, we had the full team that we were aligning and bringing on board for.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:30:31.615Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-08T20:30:32.259Z)

This.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:30:33.615Z)

Did you guys kind of approach any, like, was there any way to, like, to accelerate that or maybe iterate to get it out faster or were there technical constraints? That just didn't make that.

### You (2025-12-08T20:30:42.659Z)

It was a combination. There were technical concerns that had to be addressed. Like I said, the architecture and how we operated, the back end, the data extraction. But there were also concerns from Berkadia and some of the people there is how does this fall into our business plan? So there's a lot of work going back and forth with stakeholders. Basically, I had to do a lot of educating. Because this was something they had no experience with whatsoever. And so there was meetings, presentations, education, telling them exactly what we want, client feedback. So if we were with an organization that understood what multifamily asset management is, it could have been done. Faster. Maybe a year instead of two would be optimistic. But to them, an asset manager. Is really like an accountant who has to manage all these different funds and assets. They weren't familiar with what a multifamily operational asset manager does. Overseeing the day to day leasing of all these different apartments and working then with their JV partners and kind of working in the middle there. It was a really satisfying project. And yeah, it was some frustration there. Points. It's like, wow, do I have to go through this meeting again? But do what you got to do.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:32:33.695Z)

Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Kind of shifting gears a little bit. What kind of role do you think the product manager plays in. In Velocity? Like, do you think they. It's mostly on the development team. You feel like product can, can kind of get ahead of that. I'm curious, like, you're, you're view there.

### You (2025-12-08T20:32:53.379Z)

I am going to preface this that I was lucky enough in every organization I had to have a product owner that worked directly with the backlog. Working with the engineering team, so I did not have to get into JIRA or in the other most cases with the Microsoft Azure products. I could certainly write tickets, I could put together the acceptance criteria, et cetera. But when it comes down to Sprint planning and all the things involved there, I was involved. But simply. Making sure that the product owners made sure that everything was done as it needed to be. Now, to answer your question, yeah. Product certainly does have an impact on velocity. Could be negative, could be positive, right? Sometimes I have observed where product managers. Don't have very strong technical backgrounds, so they don't understand. Well, why can't we just build this in a linear order? Doesn't it make sense that we build this and then this and this? They don't understand dependencies or what needs to be done in advance. So. I've seen people get in trouble that way. So. This kind of circling back to when I was talking about the process advocadia. One of the things I championed as part of the product LED is what we called the Four Horsemen, where the product manager, designer, architect, and lead engineer basically work on these projects right from the start. Or as close to it as possible. Product manager always does the first bit of the legwork, but then when it comes time to look at everything, We were able to surface and solve a lot of problems. Way earlier in the process. Than wait until it got to that point where we had issues with the backlog. And that made it way more efficient. We were able to put out way more tickets. In much shorter time.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:35:26.095Z)

Okay. How would you. So this role, it is, you know, we don't have product owners. Product manager is kind of traditional product. They're, you know. They're working with lead engineers. They're still kind of managing the back back log. Like I write tickets all day long for the development team. How would you being in that kind of role more in the weeds.

### You (2025-12-08T20:35:49.139Z)

It doesn't intimidate me just because I wasn't deeply involved in an agile scrum process of assigning tickets and everything else. A lot of the things that I have done. More as a consultant. Right. So I've been working with this team on the hospitality, but I also have experience along the lines I worked as a consultant to Rent Lytics. They were purchased by RealPage. I worked with Infotain, they were purchased by Site Plan, but in all three instances they were small teams. And we didn't have to worry about Linear handing off. We worked very closely, wrote the tickets. I would say it was probably more of a scrum ban process. It wasn't strict agile. We have two weeks to do this. I really think in a smaller team, Scrum band works really well. And that eliminates the need for all the story points, the poker, to put everything together. And you work hand in hand with the engineers. Almost kind of like a now, next, later. Right. Keep it simple without having all of the administrative overhead of having to do all of that project. That I am very, very comfortable with. Not a problem.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:37:22.575Z)

That makes sense. Cool. I have one more question and I want to leave you about five minutes to ask me questions. But describe to me like your ideal next landing, like your next position, your next role. Like, if you could weigh the magic wand, like, what would it look like?

### You (2025-12-08T20:37:41.939Z)

I really, really. Like. The role of an individual contributor. The ic. It's not my goal. To be overseeing a large team of asset managers. I think basically what I did at rediq as a senior Director of Product Management, Was the perfect position. Right. I had all of the product owners reported to me. The product managers had dotted line. I reported to the VP of Product. And that to me, working with those small teams was great. And I continued to lead the major projects like the Lifecycle Management Suite, things like that. And the VP of Product. She didn't have any product manager experience. She was a fantastic project manager. So we actually kind of co led the team. I was more on the product management, she was on the project management and it really helped things going. But when I saw. What she was doing or what Steve's obelis doing. I just. I have no desire to be the person who sits behind a desk and tries to manage the teams and keep things going. I'm very, very creative. And I need to. Be creating something. Not. Not paper, so don't want to do paperwork. But. But yeah, I mean, if I could be an individual contributor. And you know, of course, have a small team that I would work with. I've been doing this a long time. So, you know, I love mentoring other product managers, product owners, etc. And you know, I always make sure everybody understands the why. We're doing something. And not just the. The how or, you know, things like that, so. Yeah, I'm. I'm sorry if I'm having a difficult time articulating this, but, yeah, I mean, that, that's really the bottom line, is a senior level individual contributor. Leading and mentoring a small team. I guess I should have just said that at first. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:40:20.175Z)

All right, well, those are my questions. I'll leave you five minutes here. What questions do you have for me? Happy to answer anything that comes to mind.

### You (2025-12-08T20:40:26.899Z)

A couple easy ones at first. What is the tech stack that you're using?

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:40:31.295Z)

So Ruby, we're in aws. I think from. I know that we use postgres and other kind of. We use redshift as well from a database perspective. React. Native react. I think we're reacting the front end, I'm pretty sure. But yeah.

### You (2025-12-08T20:40:50.499Z)

So what about the product team then? What are you using? Jira, Azure, DevOps. Something different.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:40:59.375Z)

We use linear. Linear or kind of mix.

### You (2025-12-08T20:41:00.739Z)

Okay? Yeah. Love it.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:41:06.735Z)

We use a lot of AI tools. Granola, note taking, Gong. I use a lot. I do a lot of prototyping. So lovable. I don't know if. Do you do typing at all?

### You (2025-12-08T20:41:19.139Z)

Yeah. To put it lightly, absolutely. In effect, that's. That's one of the reasons why I've been. Take. I. I almost think this last year has been more of a sabbatical and I have just been. Taking a deep dive into the no code products. And so, yeah, I'm on proficient and lovable. Replit bolt. Last couple months, I've been working almost exclusively in Claude code and the cli. You know, I've put together many full stack. In fact, this consulting that I'm doing, I actually built their internal CRM as well as a. A a. Roadmap product. You know, CRM was a knockoff of HubSpot. I mean, it's, it's a lot of fun. Yeah. But, yeah, been doing an awful lot of prototyping, checking out linear over that, that period of time, a lot of, a lot of different tools that, that, you know, that's one of these things I've learned. You know, I could put together a prototype in 24 hours of a lot of this different stuff, so. Yeah. Nice, nice little lot of toys that I've been playing with over the last year.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:42:36.495Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-12-08T20:42:40.819Z)

So. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:42:40.895Z)

Nice.

### You (2025-12-08T20:42:42.979Z)

Yeah. I mean, honestly, I I I get probably. 10 newsletters a day, all related to AI. No code tools. I mean, I'm. I'm just an AI fanboy. How else to put it? Yeah. I'm just very, very comfortable. Agentic AI it also the shortcomings of AI I mean, I. I have a good grasp of what AI can do. So, you know, to me, AI is not the be all, end all. It's. It's a great tool, but it still has a way to go. But what it does do well. You know, like the coding and other things, you know, it's just. It's. It's just been a blast to work with.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:43:33.055Z)

Awesome.

### You (2025-12-08T20:43:34.099Z)

So we talked about the framework and what I did at Berkadia But how would you describe the framework? What do you use there in terms of prioritization?

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:43:46.575Z)

Yeah, you know. There. I mean, at a high level, it's impact, like whatever. Whatever features of belief have the highest impact on leverage for the customer base. That's certainly what's being prioritized the most. We do have lien on. Like, we're. We're an early product, and so getting feedback from customers on that product is critical. And so as we go through the sales cycle, or it's existing users, you know, just getting that, that pulse of like, what, what are they trying to accomplish? What is their workflow? What features are missing to to serve them. What are competitors doing? Layering that all in. And so we are a growing company. We have pretty lofty revenue goals. And so a lot of what we're trying to do is make sure that we're growing the company in accordance with the product. The products have an impact on revenue and things like that. And so for a prioritization perspective, you know, it's really based around impact and effort. And kind of the reach of the feature that we're building. So we don't really follow, like, an ICE framework or anything. Like, in my mind, my mind immediately goes to, is it impactful? And then if highly impactful and it's low cost to implement. Let's build it. Like usually that's where.

### You (2025-12-08T20:44:52.019Z)

Yeah. Good.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:44:54.335Z)

Our mind goes. But yeah.

### You (2025-12-08T20:44:56.499Z)

So. So my my dear tree against safe agile is not going to be held against me. I. I guess.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:45:03.855Z)

I mean, I'm not. We don't even sprint here. Like, you know, we. We have standups. We do some. We actually just change our planning meetings.

### You (2025-12-08T20:45:10.099Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:45:11.135Z)

We. We change it up quite a bit, but we are. I mean, I'll tell you, this team is the fastest team I've ever worked with, like.

### You (2025-12-08T20:45:18.259Z)

That's. That's beautiful.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:45:18.335Z)

The engineering team. Product bottleneck, which is kind of rare, so.

### You (2025-12-08T20:45:24.019Z)

Yeah, yeah. Well, I. You know, I did have this bad feeling, as I'm telling you, about my resentment against agile and thinking, oh, crap, you know, if they're an agile shop, this is not going to go well. But, yeah, if I could sum it up, you know, it's product led growth. Jobs to be done. I think that's a good way of explaining what I do as well, by finding that pain point and determine, you know, what is our job, so. So can I ask one more question? I know it's 3:45. Okay, so the product that you're. You're looking at, the tool that's geared Howard the investors. What. What problem is that solving? Or what is. Is there anything out there today that. That's similar or, you know, what, what is the vision for this product over the next year or two?

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:46:20.815Z)

Yeah, it's. It's several fold. It's very similar to what you described for Radix. I mean, the primary and, like, key use case for us is acquisitions. So we've been collecting daily rent Data on over 40 million units in the US.

### You (2025-12-08T20:46:34.579Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:46:35.775Z)

And when we have that data, obviously you can make a projection or assumption of rent, roll of expected revenue. Coming for a specific asset. And then we layer in a bunch of data. Whether that's transactions in the. In the marketplace. It could be demographical data. It could be new supply data, you name it. There's just different data sets. You're into the product. To facilitate the acquisition use case. We also have, like, things we're building out, like a pro forma model similar to Radix Directiq, just so you can look and see, like, what you would expect from, from that perspective. We also have a lot of, like, asset management who would like to use it, right. So they just want to see how their market is performing. How their properties stack up against the market. And, like, who's doing well in the market. So there's a lot of that. And then, like, you get, like, business development, similar kind of motion where you want to see, like, under assets. And you can kind of take a look and see, like, what might be a big target.

### You (2025-12-08T20:47:29.699Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:47:30.815Z)

So a few different use cases that it's. It launched about 10 weeks ago and the growth has been crazy.

### You (2025-12-08T20:47:31.219Z)

Okay? Okay?

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:47:36.815Z)

I mean, as far as competitors, costar, certainly.

### You (2025-12-08T20:47:40.579Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:47:42.255Z)

Real paycheck has some stuff. He already has some stuff. We're already winning people from from real page and Yardi Costar is going to take a little bit longer, but.

### You (2025-12-08T20:47:52.419Z)

That sounds very exciting. Of course. Real paid. Excuse me. Rediq had a lot of that in there, but that's what our integration with Radix is, what we wanted to do and wasn't able to complete. So, I mean, honestly, that's. That would be the perfect role for me right there. You know, bring us together, all. The stuff that I've done over the last 15 years in product management, prior to that, in the operations. Yeah. I'm really excited about the possibility of joining the team. I think I'd be able to add a lot right off the bat.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:48:32.975Z)

Awesome. Any. Any other questions that I can answer for you?

### You (2025-12-08T20:48:37.859Z)

No, I think that's about it. That's the only one I could think of off the bat. I mean, we had a lot of good conversation here, so. I do have some notes written up there, but, yeah, I think we've covered pretty much everything that I can think of.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:48:54.255Z)

Awesome. Well, Howard, I. I really appreciate your time and the effort in buying. We're pretty early on in the process, and just a warning, we're going pretty slow. Looking to find the right person.

### You (2025-12-08T20:49:05.379Z)

This time of year. That's understandable. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:49:08.415Z)

But we'll be reaching out to you in Next step with Next steps. If you have any questions, you're more than welcome to find me on LinkedIn. Or through the recruiter and happy to answer them.

### You (2025-12-08T20:49:16.419Z)

All. Right.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:49:17.535Z)

But they give you your time. We appreciate it.

### You (2025-12-08T20:49:19.059Z)

Yeah, likewise. Appreciate it.

### Guest (2025-12-08T20:49:21.295Z)

Thanks, Howard. Nice meeting you.

### You (2025-12-08T20:49:21.779Z)
