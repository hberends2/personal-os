# Transcript for: Product roadmap and hiring strategy for InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:16.725Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:17.445Z)

Hey, how's it going?

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:20.405Z)

Do? Ask yourself.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:21.285Z)

I'm doing all right. Just happy Monday.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:30.005Z)

Yeah. Happy Monday.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:32.005Z)

How was your weekend?

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:35.525Z)

Not so great.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:35.525Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:37.045Z)

My kids have been sick.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:37.765Z)

Oh, no.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:39.125Z)

More than a week. Yesterday he got too sick. We had to take him to urgent care.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:43.125Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:44.725Z)

He's not able to breathe properly. Then there to inhaler and all that.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:48.005Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:48:49.525Z)

Quite some time. They gave him some steroid. All that his little better. But not so well. I didn't go to office today.

### You (2025-09-22T21:48:59.445Z)

Yeah. Both of my children had. Issues like that. Group type of thing. And had to have rescue inhalers. And that's something I've been out with for most of my life as well. But how old is he? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:16.805Z)

Ages two.

### You (2025-09-22T21:49:16.965Z)

Yeah. It's scary when they have a hard time breathing.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:22.165Z)

Yeah, it was really scary.

### You (2025-09-22T21:49:23.045Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:24.565Z)

And he was bit sick in the morning, like he was throwing up. And we thought probably it is because of the air infection he had. But then he was, like, constantly coughing and breathing very heavily.

### You (2025-09-22T21:49:34.245Z)

Good. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:40.565Z)

Then we thought, let's take him to the urgent care.

### You (2025-09-22T21:49:42.245Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely at that point. Did they give you any idea what they thought it might be?

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:51.445Z)

She said he has got cold in his lungs. Something like that.

### You (2025-09-22T21:49:55.445Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:49:59.365Z)

And hopefully it will go away after some time.

### You (2025-09-22T21:50:00.805Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, hopefully it's just a minor infection that'll clear up and won't have to deal with it for a while.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:50:10.805Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:50:10.965Z)

So we're good. Good.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:50:14.245Z)

Good today, Yesterday. Anything at all Today started it. You know, drinking fluid, eating banana and all that. So that's progress there.

### You (2025-09-22T21:50:24.245Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Good. Well. Not a lot going on on my end. Here. Actually didn't do a whole lot of work over the weekend. A little bit of work on the roadmap. That I. Like I said in my text, I think I finally got them looking in the short term and not worrying about five years out.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:50:56.085Z)

Five. Yeah, it's crazy.

### You (2025-09-22T21:50:56.245Z)

Oh, man. During that meeting last week on Thursday, where I'm going over the roadmap and it's like, Mark. And Drew specifically asked for at least three years, maybe five years. So I went out three years. And, you know, got all these things on this massive Gantt chart. And then finally Mark says, maybe you should just go out a year. I don't know. You might have even been on the call yet when they said. Or maybe it was after you dropped.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:51:16.885Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:51:29.845Z)

Okay? I'm glad you're finally coming around, but I spent hours putting this thing out three years.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:51:36.165Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:51:39.125Z)

But, hey, I think they just needed to see it. And realize that. Yeah, we don't want to get that in front of anybody right now. Wouldn't make sense. So I think I'll put the finishing touches on that this evening because.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:51:52.325Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-09-22T21:51:56.325Z)

On when I was driving back home this afternoon and I saw Mark sent an email with a draft of the one pager, so I better take a look at that. And get this roadmap to him.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:52:11.765Z)

It did send. I think I checked the email, but yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:52:15.445Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:52:15.445Z)

Probably. There's some emails. Okay, so. What I wanted to discuss with you. One is I am behind. I just couldn't get to this. Because of my kids. Everybody was sick. Like last week, both my kids are sick. My wife was sick.

### You (2025-09-22T21:52:32.485Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:52:36.805Z)

And this weekend my son was sick, so I. I'm kind of behind. But I heard that. You remember last time when I was drew was asking me to demo something.

### You (2025-09-22T21:52:39.765Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:52:49.845Z)

I uploaded. Not rental financial with multiple tabs. And multiple tabs. Is currently not supported.

### You (2025-09-22T21:53:01.365Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:53:03.045Z)

But others I haven't tested. But I heard from Del puts today that other files are getting processed with single tab and they also sent me the files. So I'll probably share those. But, yeah, I need to test those as well.

### You (2025-09-22T21:53:22.245Z)

Okay. If there's anything I can do to help test, let me know.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:53:27.765Z)

Sure, sure. Yeah, I. I'll probably send this across to you. Please. I will open. We can go from there.

### You (2025-09-22T21:53:33.045Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:53:37.045Z)

So that. And then the other thing was that product manager guy, right?

### You (2025-09-22T21:53:40.805Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:53:43.605Z)

There. So how far are we on hiring him?

### You (2025-09-22T21:53:48.885Z)

Well, I did some research. And found that I had. Way overestimated the salary. So after you dropped and we went over that,

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:54:00.805Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:54:07.365Z)

I think I mentioned in the chat, Drew moved it from. January to November. And now. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:54:20.325Z)

November 2026 or 2025.

### You (2025-09-22T21:54:20.805Z)

Yeah, 2025 of this year. And now with the reduction, we could easily start it in October.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:54:25.045Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-22T21:54:30.005Z)

And same thing goes for a developer. So. If we want to bring on an AI specific dev, we can probably do that. Asap. You know, we'll talk about it a little bit more tomorrow. But. Yeah, I. I sent rajesh some information. Kind of gave him a little idea of what our long term AI roadmap was, so I sent him that document. As well as just the high level overview. Of what InnVestAI is and what we're doing and. He. He wanted. He. He set up a call today. But it. I had a conflict. So we'll be meeting maybe tomorrow. If not tomorrow, Wednesday. We'll see what his schedule looks like. I'm not going to make him an official offer. I still definitely want to make sure that he has a chance to talk to everybody, but. Yeah, I, I it's one of those situations where, you know, I worked with him. For three years.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:55:35.765Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:55:35.845Z)

He's really good. Probably one of the best product owners. And then he moved into product management. You know, I don't really think it's necessary to. Try to recruit somebody out there. Let's just pick up and run with it. And so I can, you know, kind of have him focus on some of the AI projects. I mean, not exclusively. I would still be doing a lot of work in there as well.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:55:58.965Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:56:08.405Z)

And I want him to kind of make sure that he's very familiar with just, you know, the basic core product that we're putting together as well, but. It'll be helpful because. Had a really good call today for an interview. I. I don't know how much longer I can hold out without getting something. Had to make another withdrawal from my ira. To pay the bills. So. Yeah, we'll see. I mean, it was. It was a really good call.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:56:44.485Z)

I'm. I'm in debt. That. That's what I'm thinking, Howard. Like, I don't know what this guy is gonna do, right? If we can pay him 4300 per month. Instead of paying him, probably we could increase this a little bit. I'd rather pay you. Right.

### You (2025-09-22T21:57:04.805Z)

Yeah, I know. That's. That was a lot of the debate on the call. Whether or not. It's. A good idea to pay investors. I mean, pay founders. Too soon. You know, because a lot, especially, you know, the investors who get in really early, they don't invest a lot. Like, you know, the ones we're talking to are 50,000, 75,000. And they want to. They want their money to go towards building the product. Not to giving a salary to the founders. You know, they don't know. You know what happens. If they never even get the product out the door? But they got paid as salary, so. I agree. I mean, I would love to do that, but that's probably not going to happen for the four of us. Until we get our, you know, initial Series A. But, you know, we are still working to get you full time. Because that's way more important. You know, and that's another reason why I want to bring Rajesh on is because, well, you know, we can pay him. I don't need to be putting in 40, 50 hours a week. I can, you know, take on another job.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:58:19.285Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T21:58:29.685Z)

You know, See how that goes.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:58:35.365Z)

See, my thing is the level of commitment a founder is gonna have, level of clarity. That I. I cannot imagine anyone else having. And, you know, you putting your even four hours or five hours would be much, much more than he putting his eight hours, nine hours. Is he gonna come full time or he's gonna do part time?

### You (2025-09-22T21:59:02.485Z)

You can see he could start full time. What I had Drew put in the budget would be the full time. Salary. Not that we really have a, you know, full 40 hours worth of work forums, so a lot of that might be. You know, some. Some education, maybe taking a couple classes on AI and starting to, you know, maybe get more up to speed in that area. And I don't know, you know, maybe we wait until November. You know, maybe we see how it goes. It's like, you know, I'm not going to push to bring them on right away. But, yeah, we'll. We'll see how it goes. And I'm not going to try to make too much out of this call today. I mean, it was a really good call. I know the company. I know the CEO. But. It doesn't mean.

### Guest (2025-09-22T21:59:54.805Z)

Yeah. How it is coming to like 52,000. We are paying offshore guy 52,000 instead. Really? We pay? If we cannot pay more, just same amount to you, that will make much more sense.

### You (2025-09-22T22:00:06.805Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:00:07.925Z)

Even you are committed here just four hours.

### You (2025-09-22T22:00:09.285Z)

Oh, no, no. I mean, I. I don't even need 52,000 to pay the bills. I could do a lot less than that. But how do we do that?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:00:10.645Z)

Really?

### You (2025-09-22T22:00:18.645Z)

Without. Without. Raising suspicions. From potential investors. That's what we need to figure out. So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:00:31.765Z)

I mean, even we are founders. We. We in Northern. I stay here without payment for long, right?

### You (2025-09-22T22:00:35.605Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:00:38.965Z)

I mean, even invest. Investors are after us, right? We are not there. There are no investors. If I'm not working, you are not working. What are investors gonna do?

### You (2025-09-22T22:00:46.245Z)

Yeah. One of the things I want to bring up. Is. What if you and I actually become employ ers or employees? But retain our ownership. Percentage. I don't care if I have the word founder on my business card. Means nothing to me. And if that's what's preventing you and I from being able to get paid,

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:01:09.045Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-09-22T22:01:14.965Z)

Then fine. You know, you can be the senior vice president of engineering. I'll be the senior vice president of product. I don't need that, chief, on my business card. Right, so.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:01:25.045Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:01:26.565Z)

You know, I don't want to give up the equity. That's my retirement fund. That's gonna. That's gonna get me my little hut on the beach of Belize. But, yeah, I don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:01:38.885Z)

Yes. Basically, my concern is we are putting hard work, right? We are committed, but the other person is getting paid, not us.

### You (2025-09-22T22:01:42.245Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:01:48.805Z)

Like we have been. Like, you have been working on this for so long.

### You (2025-09-22T22:01:51.045Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:01:52.405Z)

Now we are hiring other manager. I don't know what very different he is gonna do from engineering perspective if you give me requirement just in a word document.

### You (2025-09-22T22:02:03.365Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:02:03.845Z)

That's just sufficient for me. If you need a board, scrum board or PBI or anything, I'm gonna create that.

### You (2025-09-22T22:02:08.965Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:02:09.525Z)

For you if. You know, that's the thing. I don't see anyone else having more clarity than you have.

### You (2025-09-22T22:02:11.205Z)

I agree with you. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:02:16.005Z)

That's the point. I don't know. How much value he's gonna add, and even then, he's very, very costly. Even we are doing offshore. He's like 52,000. Oh, that's too costly. From my perspective.

### You (2025-09-22T22:02:28.565Z)

It's the top of the range, I admit that. You know, we could. You know, I haven't talked money with him at all. That subject hasn't even come up. So, I mean, we could go less than that, but the only thing I'm thinking is, That would allow me. To get another job and then pay the bills. And kind of. And kind of. Yeah. And hand off the work to him. And would it slow us down? Probably.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:02:55.605Z)

If you get at all right.

### You (2025-09-22T22:03:02.325Z)

But I would be more of a in a mentor type role than an actual. Individual contributor, which I don't like that either. I mean, trust me. If there's a way to avoid it. I'm. I'm willing to do that. I can, you know, put. Put off a hire until Q1, you know, which would be way better for our business plan, but, yeah, we got to figure out a way how we can do that. So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:03:33.045Z)

Yeah. I don't know. I would rather insist you getting paid here in West AI than somebody else. Getting paid before you. I know. We are founder. We'll have probably much more equity later on. But that's future. We don't know. We might shut down INS six months.

### You (2025-09-22T22:03:49.125Z)

Right. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:03:55.125Z)

If all our founders start fighting and all that, we might sit down next month. We never know.

### You (2025-09-22T22:03:58.405Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:01.685Z)

So, yeah, I would still suggest rather than paying somebody else outside,

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:04.405Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:05.365Z)

I would see you. And it's paying this much, if not much, to start with.

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:09.925Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:11.525Z)

Of course. I already have some work going on.

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:11.605Z)

We'll. We'll have to see how it goes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:15.925Z)

Yes. Cool, cool. So that and what else? I wanted to talk.

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:24.085Z)

Yeah, that was actually the only two things on our chat from last week. Roadmap and, you know, the whole thing with Rajesh and Offshore Team, but. You know, today was the first call. This is gonna go on for weeks. This isn't something where, yeah, I'm gonna have one interview and get an offer, so at least we've got time. And we'll see how it goes. So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:50.565Z)

I would suggest go slow on Rajesh too.

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:51.525Z)

Oh, yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:53.845Z)

We don't need immediately.

### You (2025-09-22T22:04:54.725Z)

After. I have to check to make sure my wife's not behind me, but, yeah, I'm gonna. I'll drag my feet.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:04:56.005Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:00.005Z)

Yeah. I'm not gonna rush into this in any way.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:02.005Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Because I would like you to get paid rather than. Really? That's how it should be. You put so much effort.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:09.605Z)

Well, yeah. That goes both ways, you know?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:14.325Z)

And.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:14.805Z)

It's. So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:18.805Z)

So I just wanted to go through this real quick.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:23.125Z)

Now that, remember, this is what I'm gonna change. So, you know, ignore everything on the right half of the page. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:30.565Z)

All right. Yeah, I see a lot of work for you. Probably put. See, as far as requirement goes, if you can just put the requirement in World Document. I don't need a PBI board or anything.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:35.525Z)

Oh, a ton of it. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:44.245Z)

But if you need, we can create that as well and, you know, show progress and create this model pbis.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:45.685Z)

Okay? Yeah. Are you? Are you starting to use Jira, then? Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:05:53.685Z)

Yeah, we can use it if you think it is useful.

### You (2025-09-22T22:05:56.725Z)

I. You know, now that you got a team of engineers, I just thought you would actually, because you mentioned creating a pbi, I assume that's what you meant is to create it in jira. And use Jira, but totally up to you.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:06:10.885Z)

I mean if you feel they are useful to you from product perspective, I can create it from my end. I know what these guys are doing on day to day basis. We have a WhatsApp chat group and we keep chatting on that.

### You (2025-09-22T22:06:19.045Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:06:26.325Z)

Day in and day out.

### You (2025-09-22T22:06:27.845Z)

It would. It would help. So when you were on the call last week, I know we were talking about, like, burndown reports and. You know, how do we measure the progress? You know? So right now, you and I, we get on, we say, okay, we demonstrated this, we did that. But it would be really nice if we used Jira and tied it into the roadmap that we've got in Confluence, the idea board. That's the only reason I would say to start it now. You know, because I don't think, you know, with three engineers and you and I that we need to get so formal.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:07:05.765Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:07:12.245Z)

But the good thing is we're still within that. Free. Usage.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:07:20.565Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:07:21.765Z)

We don't, we don't have enough users to start charging yet, but I do think, I think the free level is up to five. So I do think if we brought on or had one more person that had access, then we would probably have to start paying, but it's not much. It's like nine or ten dollars a seat per month. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:07:44.965Z)

And current Jira is with Office 365? Something like that.

### You (2025-09-22T22:07:49.685Z)

That is part of the godaddy. With the office. 365 yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:07:53.925Z)

Got it. Okay?

### You (2025-09-22T22:07:56.005Z)

But I can't get in there and make any changes now because it's been moved to aws. So we have to figure it's like we're paying for the Microsoft services.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:08:06.885Z)

Then not. It's not with aws. It's just that day and had to give me access and it is kind of still stuck.

### You (2025-09-22T22:08:15.525Z)

Okay? Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not blaming aws. I'm just saying that when we migrated it, I no longer have access as an administrator. I can't add or change users.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:08:20.165Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:08:29.445Z)

So, yeah, I don't know if that's still the case, but, yeah, I know it was between you and Diane getting access somehow. I don't know how she's gonna do that. I mean, because it's under her account, her name and her password and. I mean, I don't know how we can split that out.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:08:37.845Z)

Yeah. Yeah, actually, it doesn't. Yeah. She doesn't have the password. Caesar. Her husband was somewhere, and he'll come back and give the password or something like that. It kind of still is stuck in that.

### You (2025-09-22T22:08:54.565Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:08:55.925Z)

Process.

### You (2025-09-22T22:08:57.845Z)

It's no big deal. It's just emails at this point. We're not doing anything else, but that's what gives us the teams. And then we also, of course, have all the other. Microsoft products, but it's part of. That subscription, and you do have to use an InnVestAI email. To log in to get like Microsoft copilot. And all that other stuff as well.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:09:29.605Z)

And I quickly wanted to understand the evaluation part. Once valuation. I think Sebum did some work on this. So this one, Right. So I think this one needs to have. Have a save button, right? So whatever is here. I don't see a save button anywhere down here.

### You (2025-09-22T22:09:48.645Z)

I didn't put it. I didn't put a save button.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:09:50.085Z)

But here, right?

### You (2025-09-22T22:09:52.405Z)

I just. Basically, it's live anytime you change the value it was calculating in the poc. But I do kind of think if we're going to do any type of versioning, then we do have to have a save button.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:09:53.685Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:10:05.605Z)

And then. Go from there, so I'm not opposed. If we want to, I would imagine we would want one on every tab. And then. Yeah, I mean, I think every single one of them would have room. Now that one.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:10:20.965Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:10:24.565Z)

When I built the poc, it got stuck in the error loop where I kept. I wanted those input boxes aligned in the center like the other ones, not all the way to the right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:10:24.645Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:10:38.565Z)

It's the only one like that. But, you know, so we could, you know, have it consistent with the button in the bottom right corner, except, I think. Is it the financing that has all of the. Detailed closing costs. That tab. Has that thing on the right too. But, yeah, we. We could figure it out. So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:11:09.925Z)

Because if we have save button, then it like once the user comes in future we'll see the same values.

### You (2025-09-22T22:11:14.725Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:11:15.925Z)

Populated here. Right. And I believe these some of these values also go in performa or we just are used.

### You (2025-09-22T22:11:23.285Z)

Some of them do go into the pro forma.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:11:24.725Z)

Here.

### You (2025-09-22T22:11:28.565Z)

So. The.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:11:33.685Z)

There's a purchase price somewhere, I believe.

### You (2025-09-22T22:11:34.325Z)

Yeah, there is a purchase price. You'll also calculate your debt service, which actually, that doesn't go into the pro forma, that goes into the. Investment summary tab. I. Yeah, you know, that's a good point. I don't know. Yeah. If you can leave the. The bottom half showing real quick.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:11:48.405Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-22T22:11:58.645Z)

Loan. Equity contribution. You know, I don't think anything in here. Goes into the pro forma. Except if you go back to the Acro. Is it the acquisition or financing? One of them has the home period. Hands down at the bottom, so. See. So it's not that tab.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:12:23.525Z)

Let's go to Valancy.

### You (2025-09-22T22:12:24.805Z)

Yeah. Term. Term is the hold period. So that is going to determine how many columns you have for forecasting.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:12:30.005Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-22T22:12:34.245Z)

So. Yeah. So if it's a five year hold, there will be five projection years.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:12:35.925Z)

Ay.

### You (2025-09-22T22:12:42.725Z)

And I did notice as I was going through there, I think I changed the PRD to change that from term to hold, period. So yeah. Easy, easy. Little fix, but.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:12:56.805Z)

Launch. Er.

### You (2025-09-22T22:12:59.285Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:13:00.085Z)

Okay? Cool. And what was the other thing that I wanted to ask? Something in the form, I believe. Where is what? I think there's something I wanted to ask. And never what any other. I'll reach out.

### You (2025-09-22T22:13:15.205Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:13:18.645Z)

Oh, yeah, I remember now. So these guys are saying in the last call, we decided that these room keys will come from the deal creation flow, right? Wherein the user punches in the key, and that's what it is.

### You (2025-09-22T22:13:29.925Z)

Right. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:13:34.805Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-22T22:13:34.805Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:13:36.005Z)

So user just inserting it once. We'll just populate it for all the years, right?

### You (2025-09-22T22:13:40.565Z)

Initially. But one of the things that was pointed out is we will need to have some type of an override, you know, because this is assuming that you're not going to make any additions. But what if somebody buys a hotel and wants to add another wing?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:13:43.045Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-22T22:13:59.605Z)

Or something else. So there could be. Situations. It's not going to happen all the time, but could there will be situations where they might go from 123 rooms to 150.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:14:09.605Z)

But.

### You (2025-09-22T22:14:14.565Z)

If they add more rooms. Right, So.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:14:18.485Z)

In one particular year.

### You (2025-09-22T22:14:18.965Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:14:20.325Z)

Right. So this might have 123 and this might be 150, something like that.

### You (2025-09-22T22:14:25.285Z)

Yeah, well, it wouldn't be in the historical, but it would be in the forecast. Right. So, yeah, in the historical, it'll. Whatever number of rooms exist on the day that they close that will be already accounted for.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:14:31.765Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:14:42.565Z)

But yeah, I mean, who knows, you know? So in 2027, they may want to. Add another 50 rooms. So there's got to be some way of either directly overwriting those or. Something, but that's one of the things I intentionally held off changing because we wanted to talk to users about that. You know, how often does it happen? How? How would they want to see something like that happen? Because it's like. It's like apartment communities. You don't just all of a sudden go from zero to 100 units. You know, you release units as they're built, so there's actually a gradual ramp up. And so how do you account for the revenue? For something like that, because I need. Each month you'll be getting additional revenue, and right now we're just looking at a year and not monthly. So that's one of the reasons why I wanted to kind of.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:15:40.165Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:15:41.845Z)

Hold up on that.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:15:46.645Z)

We're forward with this, please have a look.

### You (2025-09-22T22:15:48.965Z)

Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:15:49.205Z)

When you download.

### You (2025-09-22T22:15:49.765Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:15:56.005Z)

Let's say where to get here. Anything else from your site?

### You (2025-09-22T22:16:04.085Z)

No, no, that's it. I made a couple notes to myself to finish off that roadmap.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:16:08.005Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-22T22:16:09.765Z)

Part. I'll make sure everybody has access to that PowerPoint. I don't remember if I shared it yet or not, but. I can. I'll send you. You know, at a minimum, I'll send you another PDF or a screenshot of the. One year roadmap, so it's not as messy as the one that you got there.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:16:32.885Z)

Ay. So, like, how did you reach to this, like, with Dayan and these guys? Or you just made it yourself?

### You (2025-09-22T22:16:43.845Z)

Made what? The roadmap.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:16:46.325Z)

Like this.

### You (2025-09-22T22:16:47.525Z)

Just made it myself.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:16:47.685Z)

Roadmap. Okay?

### You (2025-09-22T22:16:51.445Z)

And I hate. I hate myself for doing it because this is what I spent so much time with Nancy telling her not to do. You don't use PowerPoint for a roadmap, but given the fact that we don't have JIRA or, you know, any of the other tools, it's like, well. What else am I going to do? And it's only for a single pager for one conference, so I figured I could lower my standards. And use PowerPoint. But no, I definitely do not want to continue to use this. So we either. We either pull the trigger and use confluence. Which I've got everything set up.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:17:30.005Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:17:30.965Z)

And it does everything we need to do. Or, you know, we got to figure out what's going on with how we want to set that up.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:17:43.605Z)

Well.

### You (2025-09-22T22:17:46.325Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:17:46.805Z)

Sounds great. Sanskrit.

### You (2025-09-22T22:17:48.965Z)

And, of course, I wanted to make sure that you have a chance to look at it before we call it official, because, you know, if you see anything wonky with the timing or if there's a dependency that's not accounted for, want to make sure that it's reflected in it as well.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:17:50.085Z)

So as far as, like. Yeah. I mean, timings really depends upon how much, you know, availability I have. And you have. Right.

### You (2025-09-22T22:18:11.525Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:18:16.245Z)

That so, I mean. If we are aware, we can create it. Two things.

### You (2025-09-22T22:18:25.845Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:18:26.005Z)

Real quick.

### You (2025-09-22T22:18:28.405Z)

That's. I mean, honestly, I think we've done really well. For a product of this complexity.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:18:35.525Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:18:37.205Z)

To get this far.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:18:38.645Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-22T22:18:38.885Z)

And really, it's mostly been like 90 days. I mean, I bet I would tinkered with the POC and built it gradually. Prior, but by the time. We actually got the website, the GoDaddy and everything else. I mean, that was what, June? So. Yeah, so, I mean, we've done a lot in 90 days.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:19:00.325Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:19:02.965Z)

For this complexity.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:19:04.325Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:19:04.885Z)

And, you know, I'd love to keep that momentum going.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:19:06.405Z)

Yeah. Right. I think extraction has taken major, major timing, otherwise we would have gone long ahead. Because initially I thought extraction would be. What do you call? Druze data. Right. That was straightforward, because that I did with Python. This one was bit complex. This one is a bit complex, so, yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:19:23.845Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:19:31.605Z)

That's has taken time, and it's gonna take time to improve and, you know, figure out any new format and all that. Otherwise we would have done a lot more progress on the AI I think AI Is kind of simpler to do with bedrock. Or azure AI or anything like that. Rather than initially. Right. We didn't know much about how these things work, so we are kind of trying to train the models ourselves. And then hosting the model on our platform. While, you know, these platforms already has these capabilities, so which, you know, we are familiar with now. So we can really do lot more work on the AI side.

### You (2025-09-22T22:20:15.685Z)

That makes sense. Yeah. Okay? All right. Yeah. Hopefully I can send you that roadmap tonight or tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:20:27.045Z)

One last thing, right?

### You (2025-09-22T22:20:31.845Z)

Well before our meetings. Okay, I'm sorry.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:20:35.765Z)

Suppose we had decided to pay like 43,000. Whatever I. 4,000 was 4,000 to this guy. Who is gonna pay? Is it gonna be Mark or True? Because we don't have anything in our account right now.

### You (2025-09-22T22:20:47.605Z)

No, I think the assumption was that nobody can get paid until either. One of the checks. Gets written either the 50,000 from Mike or the 75,000 from Diane's other contacts. The 75,000. Sounds like it's pretty much a done deal. I don't know if Diane has said anything to you, so if not, just make sure this stays between you and I. But she's actually trading consulting hours.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:21:18.405Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:21:19.925Z)

For the $75,000. So it's not just that they're writing us a check. That they are writing us a check. For InnVestAI, but she's also going to be doing some work for them. So. Last week. I know she was working on getting her paperwork filed with them. Or whatever. Almost like pre employment. So that one I think we could see soon. The 50,000 from her friend Mike. He's a very good negotiator.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:22:08.565Z)

He's a lawyer, so, yeah, you must be.

### You (2025-09-22T22:22:09.285Z)

He's pushing back on the valuation. He wants to have a bigger percentage, so he wants the lower valuation so that his $50,000 is worth more equity. That one. I hope it goes through, and I think it'll go through, but. It's not 100%. But the other one for 75 is, I think when that check is received in cash, That's when we could start somehow. Getting. Some money. Either to reimburse or whatever. I mean, we can. I don't know how. We would. Call it. Right. But we'll figure that out.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:23:00.885Z)

Because just for this one, 200 for the offshore guys. Three guys, right? It's gonna be 1400 now. I had to, like, ask to multiple times. I told him to maintain that this time it is delayed.

### You (2025-09-22T22:23:11.765Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:23:17.765Z)

That's what I was wondering.

### You (2025-09-22T22:23:19.045Z)

Yeah. We can't afford to lose them over late payments. We got it. They got to be paid on time. Even though it's not technically payroll, we have to treat it like payroll.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:23:20.645Z)

If we are. Right? I mean, they are barely getting paid this 400, by the way. I was. Do you know how much he asked for? Like, zero. Experience. Nothing. 1500. Like I minimum. I expected 1500 dollars. I like. Okay, that seems reasonable. I've experienced guys working for like 600.

### You (2025-09-22T22:23:56.165Z)

All right. Anything else. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:24:00.885Z)

That's all, Howard. Thank you.

### You (2025-09-22T22:24:01.445Z)

Yeah. We'll get through this. We'll figure it out. It's but good job and I will see you.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:24:06.165Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-22T22:24:08.245Z)

All right. Bye.

### Guest (2025-09-22T22:24:08.965Z)

All right. Thank you.
