### You (2025-09-24T15:42:30.058Z)

The only people who will be using that will be brokers and investors. Right. So then the third group is asset managers. Who will probably need that detail. And upload data monthly. Another thing that we found is. Or that I've learned is that if it's just a basic. Acquisition. They only look at things yearly. They don't break it down into months. So historical. I might have 2022, 2023 and 2024. And then if I'm looking right now, I would get a statement that has 20, 25 year to date. And then I would just have to prorate the remaining months or days of the year. And then my forecasting will be 2026. 20 20, you know, and depending on my holding period. So that's very different from multifamily. So they. They don't get into that level of detail. So that's why we're rolling out in phases. You know, so we're starting with lenders and appraisers because. They don't get into the details. They don't get into monthly. Then our next rollout after that would be for the lenders and brokers, where we do have the detail. And then the last one would be for asset managers, where we'll have all the detail plus monthly in there, right? So it's. It's not difficult at all. And then from an AI standpoint. That makes it pretty easy for us to have all of the information. That we need. And really, our differentiator is number one. There is no valuation model in the industry. They have what's equivalent to the property management systems, right? So when you go and check into a hotel and they've got their little program up, you know, that's. That's kind of like a rent roll, right? So there's a lot of. A lot of companies that do that. There's a lot of, you know, marketplace, you know, like Zillow for transactions. But there's nothing that has. Anything to do with evaluation. And also those third party data providers. They're not as closed off as much as in multifamily they are. The ones that we've spoken to so far are willing to partner with us. Either as a cross selling opportunity, or maybe we just, you know, pay for some of the data. One of them. You know, we're lucky in that one of the main providers of data. Is a personal friend of one of our founders. And so we've already got an agreement that if any of our clients also use their data, He'll allow us to. You know, we'll create an API and they can pull in their data. Into our model without having to copy and paste from Excel and everything else. So. There's a lot more cooperation out there. So what we're going to end up being is very. Vertically oriented. We're not going to be expanding out into other areas, other property types. It's all going to be hotel. And eventually we could be, you know, our goal is to be that one stop. Shop. That can do anything related to. The hotels, so. Particularly with, like, lenders and servicers. You know, we can build APIs where our database. Then they can pull in and get the data that they need for, like, maybe a market area. Part of buying a property. And it's not just hotels, but any asset. Usually when you get a loan, the lender will do a physical inspection, and if there's anything that needs maintenance, they'll. It'll. It'll be written into the loan that, you know, these particular repairs must be done by. A certain date. And they put together a plan, and so we can integrate that into the model. So there's. Yeah, I could keep going with a bunch of examples, but the bottom line is. We will be able much easier than we would with. The multifamily data. To bring in data, not just from our users. Which was, you know, the problem that we had being with Berkadia and the agreements they had with some of their third party data, we were. We were literally locked out of accessing that. We don't have that issue here. So. You know, another play that we have is that you know, Costar, you've probably heard of them. They. Are the largest. Data source for all real estate. Not just a particular group. Berkadia had costar data. They subscribed to it. It's very expensive. And of course, they have hotel data. And they have what's called the Star Report, which is str, which was actually the name of the company that they bought. So they bought a company that had this. And it's the same thing. Every single data is in a standardized format. And. Right now, the way we've got it planned is that we will, you know, encourage the users. They. They can take their data. And then copy and paste it or upload it into the model. Right. So if they have a subscription. And they've paid for this data. They can upload it. And it's. It's going to be only visible to them. No. No other users. Right. So that's not going into an aggregated database, but they can upload that data. We have already talked to some of our potential initial users. And the data that they upload into the costar is very basic data. There's nothing that's really proprietary, you know? In other words, costar doesn't have. Any type of exclusive. Or intellectual property type of thing. That we can't do the same. So we're already asking them, say, okay, you know what? Tell you, tell you what. You know? Export your data into Excel and upload it into COSTAR like you've been doing for years. Do the same for us. All you have to do is push a button for them, push a button for us, right? So then we start getting the exact same data. And what happens is, if I am an investor, And I am buying a hotel. Every property that I look at, I have to pay CoStar. For that market data. Right. So I don't have a subscription. That I say so if I'm trying to buy a property in New York. I have to pay for New York data. If I'm trying to buy one in Chicago, I have to pay separately for Chicago data. And what they do is they charge about $4,000. Per report. And you get it in a PDF. For three to five business days later. It's like, wait a minute. You are like the largest organization with data. But we have to pay $5,000 for every deal we want and wait 4 days for PDF? Are you kidding me? We could give it to them. As part of our subscription. At the push of a button. Real time, right? It's like, why? And the thing is, hotels, from a monetary standpoint are a big chunk of commercial real estate. But from COSTAR transaction standpoint and just the size of the market. It's a drop in the bucket. And so it's like they don't provide a lot of the services for the hotel. Data that they do for some of the other ones, and so. We could probably just go under the radar. For quite some time. And basically providing the same data they have to all of our clients. Once we get that data going, it'll be just like, you know, what we were doing at rediq, where we need our clients to upload this information. In order to build our aggregated database. But once we get that rolling, And, you know, we also have the friendly data providers that we can just connect directly to. So that's also that. That's probably our second major play. You know, first is just a basic valuation model. Second is the data from third party. But at the same time, you know, our AI capabilities, you know, will be expanding that to where we can go out and scrape data. We can use agentic AI to go out. You know, if I work in a deal, I can have one agent that goes and gets previous sale history another. One, they can go and get tax data. Another one that can just go get general market data, right? So they can push a button and, you know, five minutes later they get this beautiful report that's got all of this data, and you know, that's, that's one of them. And then, of course, there's the marketplace. We had started to talk about this before the Radix sale. And then we put together a formal business plan. At Radix. That never happened. But we can do the same thing here. So when we get that second phase of the investors and the brokers, where we can get that detail, We now have a captive audience where we can then accommodate. Transactions between the two. And this is going to be just the same as a deal. Sharing. With Rediq. So Broker goes into our product, they create a deal, they upload all the information they need. And then they can share that deal. With our investor clients. So exact same thing. Then they go in and they make their tweaks based on their particular assumptions. And so. There are similar products out there in the market, but they're disconnected, right? They don't. It's just broker, seller. PDF. Or Excel models going back and forth. But you know, those marketplaces get a decent size of revenue. Sometimes based on the sale price, so we may not. Recognize any revenue. Until the property sales but sells. But you know, even if we get a fraction of a percentage of 120 million dollar deal. That's a fairly significant amount of revenue. To put it lightly. So those really are probably one to three year plan. Is to really focus on those. And then. You know, I mentioned in our first call, Diane, Mark and Drew, the other founders, have been in the hotel industry. For many, many years and. They have quite a laundry list. Of long term projects. It's like, I gotta. It's like, wait a minute, guys. We don't even have the basic model yet. Why are we talking about this? We can't do this for three years. Let's. Let's focus, right? So, yeah, there's no shortage of projects and features and everything else that we've got on our roadmap that'll keep us busy for easily five years. To get this built out. But, yeah, since you and I talked, you know, we've. We've had some other movement in funding and investors. Which, quite frankly, hopefully will accelerate our plans to bring on somebody like yourself as a product manager and also some engineers that are devoted strictly to the AI portion. And building out there. And not just AI. Don't. Don't get me wrong. You know, I'm an old guy, and I don't want to be around for the next 20 years working on this. I need somebody who's going to be familiar with the entire product. From A to Z, which, you know, when I look at my first hire, the people that I bring in. It's a good time because. You'll be there. From the ground floor. And be familiar with every part of the product, not just a certain area or aspect of it. So I don't want you to think that. You're going to be pigeonholed into just a particular feature or just a particular area. We need somebody right now who can focus on that to help us get off the ground. Because I can't focus on everything, and I'm more concerned about the core product. You know, if we don't get that right, doesn't matter what AI features we have, if we don't have any users. So that's kind of that. Yeah. I'm sorry for the long winded overview, but that's. That's really where we are today.

### Guest (2025-09-24T15:57:32.055Z)

No.

### You (2025-09-24T15:57:35.658Z)

So. That's. Yeah. I'm glad you set up the call. It's not to the point that we are still working on finalizing the budget so that we can get those investors. But, you know, like I said, we've had some very, very positive phone calls. It is generating some buzz, which I am not that comfortable with, because what we're doing right now for a basic AVM. Is not difficult. I don't want to attract attention of other developers. It's like, let's try to keep this a little bit quiet, people, but let's, yeah, talk to some investors. But, yeah, once we get that up and running and we start locking in some of those AI features, The node and the team have done a very good job. Of. Using AI and maybe a touch of ocr when needed. To extract the data. They went much faster than we expected. So, you know, it's all falling into place. But, yeah, one of the things that we wanted to do is to use, you know, when we get, like I said, an agent that can go and grab previous sale history, tax records, market data. All of this different things. What are the current interest rates and loan terms and everything? We could literally have somebody go through the first step. Create a deal. Put in all of that information. Upload historical financials, push a button. And instead of just extracting a financial data, it can extract the financial data and bring in all that other information, and you could literally have version one of your underwriting in minutes. And rather than having to go and input what I think my interest rate's gonna be, what are my assumptions? For the cap rate and all these other inputs that we have. At that point, you just kind of go through and make changes, whatever you want. The way I've got it envisioned is. You would put the expected outcome that you want first. And that would be based on. What are my investment requirements? What type of return do I need? And my partners, what type of IRR do they need? Their cash on cash return. And how long do they want to hold these investments? I mean, everybody has their requirements, and when they use, like, RedIQ and they go through and they do all of this work, but they can't quite get the numbers to match the investment criteria, then they stop and then they go on to the next deal. We could do the same thing here. But kind of reverse engineer. So if we know all of those requirements that they have to meet, And then they upload this document, we get all this outside data. The model can go through and make the tweaks and say, okay, this is what you need. To do in order to get your required rate of return. But that might involve. Different loan structures or different, maybe a larger down payment or more investors. And at that point, they could say the choice is either, yes, I can meet these requirements. In order to make this investment work or no. I don't have any more money to put in or I don't have any other investors. Right? And so makes it way easier. To. Move on to the next deal. If you know that there's nothing I can do. That would make it possible for me to buy this deal at the rate that I need. That's going to be. That'll be the crown jewel of the AI. Functionality that we need. And I did send you some information on agency AI. And the speed at which that's maturing. I think we can do it much sooner than we had originally anticipated. We were thinking that we're 12 to 18 months away of doing something like that. And I'm thinking now we could be 6 to 12 months away. And get into the model. Way faster than what I thought. So we'll see how that goes. All right, I've rambled. Told you my whole life story here.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:02:43.575Z)

Not really.

### You (2025-09-24T16:02:45.978Z)

What questions do you have? What can we do?

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:02:50.215Z)

Yeah. Basically, it's nothing related to the document that you have shared over. So it's basic questions like, I have no knowledge over this lovable. I mean, the low code, no code whatsoever.

### You (2025-09-24T16:03:02.858Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:03:04.695Z)

How much? To what extent? We can leverage Law Bull to build our product.

### You (2025-09-24T16:03:15.178Z)

Well beyond a proof of concept. Not much. But yes, it wouldn't necessarily be lovable, but you could even use just clod or chat GPT. It's not so much the model, it's going to be the prompt. It's like, how can we phrase this prompt so that when I feed it into an LLM. Whether it be chat, GPT, OpenAI atropic, google, whatever. Those agents know exactly what they need to get. And extract and then bring back into the model. So we can always use Lovable or some of those products, but. They don't. Do to connect them to an AI agent. Is more difficult than it needs to be. So it's like we can cut out the middleman. We know that we can build a form that has all the fields where we can input the assumptions, and then that form can feed the prompt into GPT. So that front end is. Really a no brainer. So it'll be a lot of experimentation at first. But as a product manager, one thing that I have always lived by is you don't need to have all the answers. You just need to know where to find the answers. And so. A lot of that will fall more on the engineers, right? Just like they need to code an app today. They'll need to be knowledgeable. On. What data do we need to pass through in the form of a prompt? To get the results that we need back. So that's where when we bring on an AI engineer, they will just be AI. Right. So they're going to be experienced with LLMs. They may even have a data science background or something like that. They will do. The how part. Right. And just like I've always said as a product manager, we need to determine what and why. But let the engineers figure out the how. And that's especially true. On the AI side. I wouldn't worry too much about using any particular tool. Tools like Lovable Bolds. I mean, all of those tools. Are very simple to use. You literally just describe what it is you want. And that'll put it together. And. I found as a product manager. You know, I don't want to just go and say, build me a whatever. I will actually build a PRD and user stories. And attach those documents. And that eliminates all the back and forth. And basically, you know, I'll attach those documents. And I'll say, if there's any missing information or if you need any clarification, please ask. Sometimes it'll come back and say, well, who is the primary user? Do you want to include this? I mean, it's a really cool to watch to do this. But once you have it, I just push the button and I'll sit back and it'll go through all this information, and I mean the data and the requirements. You know, Claude is amazing. I will do that. And it will come back with. Two different documents that you can just upload into. Whatever tool you're going to build it with it, it'll have an MD file. For the tasks, so it will outline step by step. How to build it. And also an architecture. So it'll create all of the back end architecture, database authentication, I mean, whatever you need to have. In a document. And at that point, You. You're all set to go. And I have done that for a couple and I've given it to. To Vinod and the team and it's like they didn't have to change anything. It was spelled out extremely clear. So there again, you don't need to know how the LLM is doing it, you just need to know. How to get it to do it, and then read through the documents and make sure that it understood and that you didn't miss anything. And that's it. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:08:04.135Z)

Yeah, that's the area I need to explore most.

### You (2025-09-24T16:08:09.178Z)

Yeah. Product management is changing. And, you know, I've got a ton of tools and prompts that I've used and built and. You know what? What? Used to take a week. Or more you know of gathering information you can do in 10 minutes. With with the right prompt. And it's more detailed and more accurate than what I've been able to put together. It. It. It will find the missing information. And so I. I'll be reading through, like, the user stories. Of like, wow. I never thought about that one. That's. That's pretty good. I'm glad it's here. And, yeah, it's. It's. Absolutely. I mean, that's why we can. Van were talking the other day. And. We didn't really start building anything until. Early mid June. You know, prior to that, it was all planning and everything else. But what we've put together in 90 days. Would have taken, you know, without using the AI resources. Nine months a year. And you know the typical. SaaS environment. So, you know, it's just. You can knock this stuff out so much faster. That's why, you know when I say we can get to these AI features, In six to 12 months, as opposed to what I originally thought. I mean, this is why we don't. I hate to say you kind of blindly let AI do its thing. I mean, you can't just push a button and let it go. But. It. It can do 80% of. The lifting. And then you need somebody to go back and review, make sure it was the code is written properly. And just test, test and test. That. 's that's really where the work is now, is more on the testing and the qa. Than the actual development. So. What else? Any other questions?

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:10:31.495Z)

Apart from Dan. True. And we know the user. Who else contributing this initiative? Forward.

### You (2025-09-24T16:10:43.178Z)

The the other, the fifth founder is Mark Gordon, and he. Is a hotel. Broker. Investor and developer. So. He has he? Led the. Hotel and hospitality group for cbre, which is the largest commercial real estate organization out there. For many years, so he was the top guy in hospitality. And then he kind of went out on his own. And he does his own. Brokerage in development right now. But with him, he knows everybody in the industry. So he has no technical skills. You know, he doesn't really get involved with anything that we're building other than, you know, to look at from a broker or an investor's standpoint and, you know, maybe testing. But his value lies in bringing. In. You know our early investors. Companies and teams and people who would be willing to help test it, things like that. So his. His industry connections are invaluable. So that's. That's really where he is, is. Is experience. Participation. In in this. Go. And. And I don't know if you remember Carrie who helped us on marketing. She was the intern. Yeah. Carrie aang. Yeah. And that she worked with Peyton. Peyton and Cassandra. I reached out to her and she's going to help with some of our go to market materials. So she's not. She's a consultant. We're. We're paying her hourly.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:12:31.495Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-24T16:12:42.618Z)

But at some point, You know, when we get to the point where we need full time marketing and things like that, you know, would love to bring her on, but she's the only other person outside of the five of us who have had any involvement. At all with with the product. So so far, so.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:13:04.375Z)

Okay? And like the other day, like you mentioned, at this point we are building from scratch. I mean, we are going from zero to one now. So at this point, I'm not at all, you know, willing or interested to discuss anything about pay, however. So rather than, you know, focusing on pay, I would like to, you know, focus on the value that I'm going to add for this project. So probably, you know, I may involve, like, an sweaty kitty guy rather than expecting anything at this point.

### You (2025-09-24T16:13:43.258Z)

In a startup. Typically. The salary is lower. In exchange for equity and ownership. But in this particular situation, I have worked with the team. On budgeting. And I will say that the salary that we would be willing to offer is actually at the top end. Of the salaries that we have, because I want somebody who. Is going to be. Taken care of. From the very beginning. In addition to having an equity position. In the company. So, you know, there's incentive to. Start. Putting together the best product possible from day one. As well as that long term. Reward of having that equity position. So, yeah, we. We can. We can talk about the details, but, you know, like I mentioned before, You know, as a startup, we do not have any type of. Formal benefits, right? We don't have an insurance plan. We don't have all this other stuff. Which is another reason why I wanted to make sure that the. The salary was, you know, at the upper level. Because, you know, you may be required to get your own insurance. However, another thing is, we are all independent contractors, basically. Or independent contributors. And. We are all adults. So. You know, without having a formal. Employee handbook. Or anything right now. It's basically unlimited pto. You know, you work the hours that work best for you. I am not looking for somebody who's going to put in 40 or 50 hours a week. Just because. We think that somebody should work 40 or 50 hours. You know, it's based on contribution. Not your. We're paying you for your contribution and not your time. Obviously. For the five of us trying to get this thing off the ground. I mean, yeah, we're putting in a ton of hours. It just. It's just part of the game. But, you know, you. You get that back, you know, on the. On the back end when you've got the equity and you've. Got money coming in. But. Yeah. I mean, that's. That's really kind of the expectation is that. You know, we're paying somebody for their expertise and. You know, if you need to work a few hours in the morning, then a few hours in the evening or whatever, it doesn't matter. We are. Working as asynchronous synchronously as possible. So using a lot of recorded videos and things like that. We don't have daily standups. We don't have, you know, that type of an environment. You know, maybe when we have enough employees that we have to implement something like that. Yeah. I mean. I mean, it makes sense, but it doesn't make sense now. Maybe in a year. Maybe a year from now. So, yeah, it's. I wouldn't say it's, you know, loose. But it's not restrictive. You know, I guess that's probably the best way to put it.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:17:41.575Z)

Yeah, makes sense.

### You (2025-09-24T16:17:44.538Z)

Okay? All right. So again. Because we don't have the check from the investor. You know, I mentioned that, you know, we can't pay somebody if we don't have the money to do it. You know, not in the position to have somebody start today. But, you know, last time we talked, you know, we were thinking. Over the holidays, December, January, time frame. But if we get some of these commitments that have been recently made sooner, we could. We could certainly start sooner than that. So, you know, right now I wish I could give you a potential starting date, but I can't. So again, I would encourage you, you know, if you can. You know, if you come up with something sooner, you know, that's. That's a risk I take. You know that. You know, maybe you're not going to be available. In four or six weeks. But, you know, if. If it's something you are interested in. Just keep me in the loop. You know, if you've got. If you've got an offer. Or something. Let me know. But, you know, I mean, I certainly will continue to provide you information. We can set up a time, your convenience. I can show you the proof of concept. You know, just. Again, just grab some time on my calendar. Whatever works. You know, we can. We can go from there. Get you more familiar with exactly what it is that we're doing before you make a decision. And go from there.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:19:23.175Z)

So, I mean, currently, at this point, I don't have any offer. Maybe at this point I can. I mean, fully focus on this. But what I feel is, like, regardless of any offer or something, I would like to continue in this project. Which is, like, interesting to me.

### You (2025-09-24T16:19:37.978Z)

Yeah, yeah. It is. It is. Yeah. I mean, it's a startup, it's a risk. Always a big risk that, you know, things could not go the way we. We plan, but. I think I mentioned the first call that when I'm sitting on these calls, With these contacts that Mark and Diane and Drew have in the industry. And we. Show them or describe them what we're doing and the reactions. The. The look on their face, the reactions that they have tell me that we're onto something. So. You know, I mentioned GR first call when Diane told me that there's nothing like it. You know, nobody has this in the industry. I'm like, somebody's got to have something like that. Why does every other asset class have this tool but Hotel doesn't? And sure enough, you know, the. The other people that we talk to that I. I hear him say, oh, yeah, this is. There's nothing like this. This is. This is awesome. Like, okay, yeah, it's. It's legit. You know, we. We found a niche. That is wide open. So it's up to us to screw it up, right? So as long as we make wise decisions. Don't rush into things. And, you know, we put together a good, solid product, and we have a good, solid roadmap. It's got as good a chance as any to succeed. So. Yeah. So anyway. We'll. We'll see how that goes. So, like I said. You know, I. Since we don't have a lot of scheduled meetings, I've got plenty of time open on my calendar and just find a time that works for you. Maybe later this week or early next week. You know, whatever you want. We'll go through that poc.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:21:45.815Z)

Yeah, sure. Howard. So probably early next week. I'll schedule a call to go through the documents you have shared. I'll go through them again.

### You (2025-09-24T16:21:54.938Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-24T16:21:55.175Z)

And just. I'll come up with questions if I have any. And the same week. You can set up walkthrough as well. For a better understanding.
