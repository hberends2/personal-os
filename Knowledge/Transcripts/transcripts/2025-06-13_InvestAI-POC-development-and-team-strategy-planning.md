And once we are on the same page, then probably we could open it up to Diane.

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:15.877Z)

Once we are on the same page, then probably we could open it up to Diane. I'm just thinking if we could add one over.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:20.116Z)

I'm just thinking if we could add one more

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:22.427Z)

Technical guy

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:22.516Z)

guy so that we can fast pace it. Right? Fast page

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:23.667Z)

so that we can find a space to write fast page, the development.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:26.946Z)

the development.

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:27.837Z)

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hi.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:27.946Z)

Because I believe, you know, we are moving quite slow.

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:32.417Z)

Quite slow. Front.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:33.536Z)

That front.

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:33.807Z)

That point. So what are your thoughts?

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:36.636Z)

So what are your thought

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:38.037Z)

On that? I have somebody in mind. Do you? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:38.216Z)

on that? I have someone in mind

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:42.317Z)

Is is it it's interesting timing because my wife and I were about it today, and I told her that you know, I am really excited about what's happening, but I just really want it to go faster.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:30:52.796Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:30:55.557Z)

And she said, well, why don't you guys get an intern? I thought, that's not a bad idea.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:04.566Z)

Yeah. I mean,

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:05.527Z)

Uh-huh. Which the the reason I bring that up is

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:06.166Z)

uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:08.917Z)

I don't know how we're gonna pay somebody

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:10.946Z)

That's true. But I don't know if

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:11.117Z)

That's true. But I don't know if we can be

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:13.956Z)

we can really bring in done and not pay anything at all.

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:15.207Z)

three. In time and not pay anything at all. There there are. I mean, she's she's a she's a department chair at a university. My wife has got her PhDs, and she's a professor. And they have unpaid internships all the time. It's not

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:37.496Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:37.877Z)

ideal mean, would love to have a paid intern actually, I would love to have a paid somebody with experience. But know, I'm I'm just wondering could there be something that we could hand off to an intern, which I kind of feel probably not.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:31:55.486Z)

Yeah. That that is

### You (2025-06-13T16:31:58.357Z)

Yeah. That that is I think we

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:00.456Z)

the problem. Right? We are not very organized right now.

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:01.187Z)

Like Yeah. We are not very. Right? No. No. Right. And the other thing is

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:05.736Z)

And the other thing is

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:07.037Z)

in that would probably

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:07.206Z)

intern would probably take

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:08.687Z)

be our

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:09.506Z)

out

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:10.187Z)

our time rather than contributing

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:10.766Z)

our time rather than contributing.

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:12.997Z)

No. That's true. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:14.066Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:14.547Z)

Yeah. I would actually think I have not spoken to him.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:17.126Z)

I would actually think I have not spoken to him

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:19.567Z)

It's just

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:19.796Z)

It's just

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:20.507Z)

I'm

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:20.676Z)

I'm tossing this idea to you only right

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:21.177Z)

tossing this idea to you. Right now. Yeah. Yeah. Do you recall there's a guy called from in

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:23.756Z)

Do you remember there's a guy called Somya Saha in Arcadia?

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:27.457Z)

Bulgaria.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:28.206Z)

He was he's amazing. He's

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:28.437Z)

Yeah. He was he's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing after that.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:31.816Z)

amazing architect.

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:33.917Z)

So I was thinking of passing this idea to him

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:34.256Z)

So I was thinking of tossing this idea to him, but then I was

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:37.387Z)

but then I was not sure how the I was doing then. I

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:38.236Z)

not sure how the obviously, we cannot hire him. We cannot pay him for sure. Only way would be

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:45.187Z)

would be to kind of

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:46.426Z)

to kind of

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:49.217Z)

probably

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:49.866Z)

probably bring him on board as

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:52.127Z)

over the one more partner.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:53.486Z)

one more partner. But I know if

### You (2025-06-13T16:32:57.087Z)

That's just a random thought. Right? No. But it's it's worth

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:32:58.226Z)

don't that's just a random thought. Right?

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:02.057Z)

bringing up, I do think. So the question is maybe not yet. So let's think about if you and I were able to put together the proof of concept. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:17.356Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:18.807Z)

You know, Diane did mention in the call that she's

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:22.066Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:23.727Z)

talked to CBRE and they did her contact there has committed to having some of their analysts help us test it. And so I'm wondering if based on their feedback,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:37.516Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:39.217Z)

then we can bring somebody on to actually make it a real product beside rather than the

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:44.686Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:47.397Z)

you know, the the the proof of concept that we have.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:49.486Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:50.867Z)

So so would you wanna bring Shoma on as

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:52.106Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:53.887Z)

as a data architect, or does he also code? He does everything.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:33:57.486Z)

And he does everything. Data, tech, codes,

### You (2025-06-13T16:33:59.157Z)

They they codes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:34:00.956Z)

He he's, like, all in one guy just like me.

### You (2025-06-13T16:34:05.547Z)

Yeah. No. That would be great. I I I did work with quite a bit. On the fact, it was the deal accelerator We worked together on he he was handling the Berecadia side of Salesforce, and and we were trying to coordinate getting all that data back and And I was really impressed.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:34:21.066Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:34:24.327Z)

Really impressed with with him. He asks asks a lot of questions.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:34:29.026Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:34:29.587Z)

Which is which is good. I mean, at some point, it's like, do you have yet another question?

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:34:34.296Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:34:38.397Z)

Yeah, it's good because, you know, I like it when people will ask questions, and then all of a sudden, boom, you get exactly what you needed the time. So I would love if there was some way we could make it work out. I guess the question is, when do we have a conversation with him and how can we structure that

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:34:56.406Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:34:57.157Z)

what would be the best timing for us. So yeah. So now that is the idea. So whenever

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:35:03.066Z)

So, I mean, yeah, that is the idea. So whenever you want to take a next step,

### You (2025-06-13T16:35:06.797Z)

you all know step. And then I just

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:35:09.796Z)

then I'll speak to him.

### You (2025-06-13T16:35:11.217Z)

Yeah. And I I I was also thinking of the upgrade.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:35:12.106Z)

And first, I would I would I was also thinking if he agrees, I just wanted him, you, me have a discussion first before we kind of, you know, open

### You (2025-06-13T16:35:19.577Z)

Kind of, you know, get up to all of

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:35:20.626Z)

up to other people.

### You (2025-06-13T16:35:21.187Z)

in the Speaking of which, I did start to think about the the client advisory board as Diane and Mark have have put it, which I am a 100% in agreement with. I've used advisory boards in the and you get some really, really good feedback. And, you know, they feel like they've got some ownership into the tool and can be very beneficial. The problem that I have is because we will be discussing things that don't work or that aren't built yet,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:03.646Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:05.157Z)

or things that are in progress, we have to have an NDA

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:07.396Z)

Bye.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:08.927Z)

in place. Which is standard practice.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:12.006Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:13.487Z)

The problem is invest a in InvestAI doesn't exist.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:16.986Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:21.277Z)

So I actually drafted up a standard NDA under my name.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:26.736Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:26.787Z)

Okay. And I was going to you know, when we talk about actually sitting down with these people Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:32.346Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:34.917Z)

If we do not have investment AI set up as a legal entity by then, you and I still have the IP. I mean this is you know, if that this IP really doesn't have anything to do with Diane or Mark,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:36:50.246Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:36:51.737Z)

or anybody else. We've we've been doing everything so far. So I think at a minimum, we would want to have an IP where it's between you and I and the client advisory.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:06.036Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:06.057Z)

Participants. And we could explain to them that you know, that's only temporary until you know, invest InvestAI analyzes its legal entity, but we

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:17.256Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:19.997Z)

don't wanna delay You know, I just don't want somebody you you know, because I keep hearing about Diane especially. You know, there's nothing like this in the industry. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:27.776Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:32.017Z)

I don't want somebody running off to their buddy and say, hey. Look at what we just

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:37.076Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:37.237Z)

you know, took took a look at. And I think we can probably do something like this and

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:39.946Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:42.057Z)

Yeah. Know, we have to protect our interests. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:44.696Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:45.787Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:47.046Z)

Yeah. I mean, that that makes sense to me.

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:47.137Z)

No. That that makes sense to me. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:49.476Z)

Yeah. And that is the other thing. Right?

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:49.627Z)

Yeah. And that is the other thing. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:52.076Z)

Making

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:53.047Z)

I

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:53.236Z)

I mean, people do need expertise where

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:54.447Z)

make

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:56.706Z)

bigger companies can make these this type of tool

### You (2025-06-13T16:37:59.157Z)

of tool. Invest

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:37:59.966Z)

in very less time.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:01.267Z)

Yeah. They have

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:01.996Z)

They have lot of money. They have resources.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:03.957Z)

their resources. They have

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:05.516Z)

They have data. They have everything. Right?

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:06.117Z)

data, their everything. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:07.966Z)

And that's the reason I

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:08.257Z)

And that's the reason I

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:10.076Z)

really wanna

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:10.897Z)

it. You know, it's out

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:11.306Z)

knock this out quickly and, you know, all my twenty four hours into it.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:15.937Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:16.916Z)

But, unfortunately, we cannot do that right now because

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:18.597Z)

Unfortunately we cannot do that right now. Right. Right. Do other do other things. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:22.036Z)

do have to do other things. And, you know, that's when I was thinking probably

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:27.007Z)

That's when I was thinking from you.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:29.276Z)

someone likes

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:29.537Z)

Some my strong thinking

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:30.846Z)

Seung. He can do really a lot of value.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:33.727Z)

Oh, yeah. No. I agree. Yeah. Definitely things we need to start planning on. So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:37.766Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:40.407Z)

know, that that's one thing I've been thinking of. So so I've actually been using two different tools

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:38:49.616Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:38:50.727Z)

to to work on that. I've been bouncing back and because I only have a limited amount of tokens and credits. So I saw use one up until it's gone, flip over, whatever. So until, like, the at the whatever the beginning of the month or point of the month, they they're both, like, I think one updates in five days. And the other one's on the or whatever. So I I can let do limited numbers of queries

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:39:20.336Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:39:22.587Z)

a day. So, otherwise, I'd be knocking way more out on that other thing if I could. But I've been giving a lot more thought to you know, just from an administrative standpoint, what we need to do so you know, the NDA is one. Pricing is another. I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:39:40.616Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:39:42.687Z)

we haven't sat down as a group and said, you know, how are we gonna price this? And who's gonna be selling this product? And, you know, client service. What I mean, all these different things. And I've also been looking a lot into different agentic products because things like client service or custom service, something that looks like they add customer or sales outreach. Can be automated. Right? But I mean, we have to have a plan in place before we really start going out to market. And

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:17.916Z)

That's true. And we have to also make feature planning, like, what else should we

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:23.947Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:24.466Z)

deliver in first phase, second phase, like that.

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:27.317Z)

Yeah. Which, by the way Which I I didn't realize that the

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:35.516Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:35.527Z)

idea board in Jira is available on the free version.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:40.936Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:42.287Z)

And I think I sent that to you, but here, let me I'm gonna pop the chat Sure. Or pop the link in the chat here.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:47.456Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:51.717Z)

Because I did put that one together using the tool that I basically copied this one.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:40:56.326Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-13T16:40:59.027Z)

But since we ate, we do have access to it. In the free version. Then we'll just keep using this one.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:06.056Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:07.827Z)

Yeah. I have you'll you'll see I've been adding quite a few things at Anytime an idea pops into my head, I'm I'm adding here.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:15.846Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:16.897Z)

So we do need to get together as a team. I think I think we we were at the point

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:21.176Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:25.777Z)

once we're comfortable with the POC,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:27.036Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:28.327Z)

we need to start having some time set aside for everybody to go through here, and we can start ranking and scoring. And putting together an actual plan for, you know, what features are we gonna add and when.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:46.666Z)

Well well, yeah, speaking of that POC, so

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:46.697Z)

Speaking of the POCs. So think just just

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:50.176Z)

I think we are having this discussion day before.

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:50.657Z)

some. Two things.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:53.426Z)

That you know, we could have whatever

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:57.317Z)

Again. I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:57.326Z)

is built on the application

### You (2025-06-13T16:41:57.907Z)

how it was

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:41:59.376Z)

available somewhere, and then we just link to your

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:01.657Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:42:01.996Z)

tool from there. Is that the still the plan?

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:06.267Z)

Yes. But we do have things that we need to consider such as authentic authentication,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:42:15.696Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:15.947Z)

Yep. That's it.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:42:17.076Z)

Yeah. We can create test user.

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:17.627Z)

Yeah. One thing I did not do is actually create a database So it's just using, browser

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:42:24.346Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:26.507Z)

storage for this, and it's not even persistent. You'll you know, if you went and used that link and you brought it up in your browser, you were to create a deal, It's not saved anywhere. This is just really kind of a I was thinking as a POC for the UI than than anything else. I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:42:42.376Z)

On the front. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-13T16:42:45.837Z)

calculations are accurate if you input data in there, it'll calculate and everything. But we do have to figure out, you know, do I need to just set up a super base connection But mostly, authentication. It's like know, we're gonna want them to authenticate going into our POC. And then if they click a link in yours, to come to mind, how are we going to control that?

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:15.636Z)

POC is just a demo. Right? So probably Diane would

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:19.227Z)

Much. Pretty much just demo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:21.106Z)

demo it. Yeah. Yeah. So we can set it up for

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:23.937Z)

we can set what our vehicle project created.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:26.906Z)

her. We could probably create a I can create a user for her in the

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:27.217Z)

And integrate the

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:30.766Z)

one I have, and then you can provide her access based on

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:34.807Z)

just like to me.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:35.646Z)

like just like you did to me. Right?

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:36.067Z)

That. Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:37.976Z)

So from mine where she's logged in, she clicks on that link.

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:39.467Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:42.486Z)

And once she lands on yours, I don't think she needs to log in or anything. It's well, I think it'll probably keeps cache or something where it just

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:52.797Z)

from

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:43:53.206Z)

picks up from last time.

### You (2025-06-13T16:43:54.897Z)

Yeah. Well, what what I was thinking is when we have actual clients testing it for us. But even then, you know, I don't think you know, maybe we don't need

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:44:07.266Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-13T16:44:10.527Z)

data persistence because at at this point, you know, they can still put in numbers. They can

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:44:13.266Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-06-13T16:44:15.467Z)

still calculations. They can still make sure everything works. For you know,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:44:20.796Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:44:21.967Z)

have to start it. Step zero, which does this make sense? Does the you know, the the UI, is it going in the proper order? Things like that. I mean, we'd focus on that before we start getting into creating a deal and uploading documents and all of that other stuff. So, yeah, maybe we can just leave it the way it is.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:44:45.596Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So probably we can toss that across to

### You (2025-06-13T16:44:45.817Z)

So probably through.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:44:50.086Z)

Diane. And if she agreed, then we are we are kind of pretty much done with the POC. So all we need to do

### You (2025-06-13T16:44:56.857Z)

Yeah. I still Mark did add or gave me some I think there are two or three more expense items, taxes, insurance. There's another one. I also have to make sure that I've got all the revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:10.946Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:14.547Z)

And then the penetration.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:17.326Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:18.537Z)

I don't have that yet. So Drew also was fairly convinced that we would also have to have a cap capital expenditure section. In as well, which basically would just be copy and paste expenses with different

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:32.836Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:36.587Z)

line items. So, yeah, I think I mean, I'm

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:40.366Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:42.737Z)

well over the hump. Anything that we add now is basically taking the existing and just creating a new section.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:49.506Z)

Makes sense.

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:50.547Z)

For it. So sense. So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:45:54.086Z)

So in the meantime, I would probably work on putting this online as

### You (2025-06-13T16:45:59.707Z)

code I is correct.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:00.726Z)

that code ID credential, right, you have those credentials, I believe?

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:03.177Z)

So Right? To

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:05.936Z)

I'll need to I I don't think

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:08.187Z)

help

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:11.506Z)

we need to use Invest AI domain. We could we could just run it the way I did earlier from GitHub itself.

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:17.907Z)

it out itself. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:21.006Z)

And then by a super

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:22.997Z)

And connect them. I think we should

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:24.026Z)

base connection, I think we should

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:24.987Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:26.506Z)

I don't know whether you remember. I think what

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:28.337Z)

What I did with something. I think it was motion. Think that I'm doing

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:29.796Z)

I did make something. I think it was motion thing that I was doing. Yeah. I think it was that one. So GitHub plus

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:36.857Z)

should work. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:37.106Z)

Superbase, and that should work.

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:38.227Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:39.156Z)

So

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:39.707Z)

And that

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:40.236Z)

then I should work on that.

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:40.267Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:41.916Z)

Making that live, and then link it to the tool you are creating.

### You (2025-06-13T16:46:42.247Z)

Think it. Okay. So do you want I I did share the GitHub URL with you. Is that is that what you need? Or

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:46:51.496Z)

Yeah. No. I just need the main URL because it it will just run on the

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:00.077Z)

browser itself. Yeah. Okay. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:01.596Z)

browser itself. So

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:03.497Z)

I've I sent that out here. Let me

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:04.276Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:05.427Z)

add that in there as well. Also, that's good how focused one. So whatever I have,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:10.166Z)

Cool. So probably that's what I'll focus on. So whatever I have, we can use that as

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:14.087Z)

we can do. That as you know, to show some UI components.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:18.026Z)

you know, to show some UI components

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:19.917Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:21.586Z)

Right? Whatever. There's some hard coded data,

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:24.587Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:25.266Z)

data coming from the database.

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:26.307Z)

You know, order time we have we have to find that

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:27.816Z)

You know, whatever time is we have, we

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:30.197Z)

we are right now, we can just put that online.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:31.076Z)

refine that. But wherever we are right now, we can just put that online. Link to the tool. And then, you know, if they wanna demo it to someone, just, you know,

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:36.067Z)

To someone just get this time. Yeah. No. That would be very helpful.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:39.696Z)

get it started and then

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:40.547Z)

I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:40.946Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:41.657Z)

know, we can we can get that set up today. And, you know, if we're just gonna link to my URL

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:46.186Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:48.447Z)

for what I've got, I as I keep adding these sections, it'll just be there. We don't have to do any I can I can can have to you, though?

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:47:57.026Z)

I can create a test user which will be universal. Anyone can use it.

### You (2025-06-13T16:47:57.667Z)

I know.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:01.216Z)

Log in and just go ahead.

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:03.407Z)

There is no authentication on my end. So Yeah. Anybody who's got that URL could pop you in there and take a look at it right now. So Well what the answer is is two thousand and

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:15.116Z)

What? Cool. Yeah. So let's let's do that. And then probably next meeting, whenever we have Monday, Tuesday. We could probably you know,

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:24.437Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:24.766Z)

let them know that this is what we have done.

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:24.957Z)

Okay. Yeah. I love that idea about Shoma.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:27.206Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:28.547Z)

You got me about that now. I mean Yeah. Thanks.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:35.386Z)

Yeah. I mean, think about it, and then we three can oh, agrees, I don't know whether he'll agree or not. I want to ask him and

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:39.257Z)

I will just open to some audit. But

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:41.426Z)

I haven't spoken to him about it. But even before approaching him, I just wanted

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:42.147Z)

he went approaching him, I just wanted to start. Yeah. Yeah. Three Right. And this

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:46.366Z)

to start to you.

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:47.817Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:48.726Z)

And discuss. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, whenever you think we are ready to do that,

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:51.987Z)

Do that. Let me

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:54.996Z)

let me know. I'll I'll ask him if

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:57.537Z)

to control it and discuss something.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:48:58.436Z)

he's interested, then we can probably discuss something.

### You (2025-06-13T16:48:59.577Z)

Okay. Alright. Alright. Yeah. No. Sounds great. So did you wanna send out a meeting invitation for Monday, Friday? You want me to do it? Yeah. I will update it. I sent it. Oh, did you? Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:49:09.396Z)

Yeah. I've updated it. I've sent it up.

### You (2025-06-13T16:49:10.857Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:49:12.566Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

Have a great weekend.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:49:14.756Z)

Of course. Thank you, Howard.

### You (2025-06-13T16:49:16.987Z)

Bye. See you.

### Guest (2025-06-13T16:49:17.526Z)

You too. Bye bye.
