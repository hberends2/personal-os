Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:36:15.372Z)

and I were talking about, and I started putting together a workflow. So I'm gonna share my screen. And this is a work in progress, but I think it'll give a good overview of what we are discussing here. So, Diane, can you see my screen? I can. Okay. Alright. Yeah. I can.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:36:35.407Z)

I can.

### You (2025-05-05T13:36:37.872Z)

This is beautiful chart. Yeah. This is this is something that I've started to work on in terms of

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:36:40.167Z)

Yeah. I can.

### You (2025-05-05T13:36:44.032Z)

mapping the chart of accounts, but it does

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:36:44.487Z)

Is a beautiful chart.

### You (2025-05-05T13:36:46.892Z)

relate to data as well. So essentially,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:36:53.667Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:36:55.682Z)

actually, I think I've got a better one now that I think about it because it doesn't show the HBIS data coming in. Let me bring up the confluence. K. Alright. Okay. So let me see here. I'm gonna add one more thing to this. That looks great.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:37:48.907Z)

That looks great. Thank you for putting that together.

### You (2025-05-05T13:37:56.452Z)

Okay. So what we are concerned about the hand. What we want to make sure that we're all on the same page. This is not really a concern like we think there's anything going wrong. Just that we wanna make sure that we are aware of the data that we're getting with Invest. And this kinda goes on to the comment that I made on our call the other day about you know, CoStar sending a cease and desist letter. To Rede IQ because we were considered to be a reseller of the data. So Vinod and I were talking about this and, you know, he had a really good question. It's like, if we are

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:38:40.277Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:38:40.832Z)

looking to ingest data from Drew, that data as actually gonna end up in an invest AI database. So if you wanna take a look at the journey here, So I'm I'm putting together workflow. So over here on the left hand side, we've got a new deal being created, whether it be by an asset manager, an investor, or broker. Right? When they go to create the deal, we're gonna go and see is this deal in the HBIS database. If yes, then we wanna automatically pre populate that data. And we've we've discussed this, you know, we we are all in agreement. Drew is on the call. We've mentioned a couple times. We don't want them to have to go and manually type in every little box on that ingestion. So we want to automatically populate it as much as they can. If not, then there's other ways here. So I don't want to go through this whole map. But the bottom line is after we get the database from HBIS, you get over here and then that's where now the user can start working on their valuation model. They've input all the information that they want have, etcetera, And when they are working on their model, it's gonna be back and forth between what they input here and then the aggregated database, InVEST database. So this data in HBIS by going this route here will end up in InvestAI. And so the question is, well, it's not really much of a question. The the issue is we have to make it clear that when that data is in the Invest AI database, that data belongs to Invest AI. Right? It's not just a matter of going back and forth between a HBIS and this. Wait, we don't really have any way of discerning When a user is creating a model even even though that model might be in the HPIS database. They may have input some information too. Right? So at that point, HPIS is only going to fill in a handful of the, the fields

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:41:10.597Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:41:12.502Z)

that we need The user's gonna have to input others. When it gets into this database, you know, we are aggregating it

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:41:19.317Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:41:20.962Z)

in in the database, and it's like we can't say, okay, well, this number here belongs to HBIS and this number right next to it belongs to us. Right? It's it's just a matter that you know, we have to spell out very clearly that this data, from that point forward,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:41:37.977Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:41:39.792Z)

belongs to Invest AI. And I don't know if those conversations have taken place yet. No. So K. And so part of that is because I've always felt and this could still be the case, and I can tell you why.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:41:52.777Z)

No. They haven't. And so part of that is because

### You (2025-05-05T13:41:56.812Z)

Maybe positioning yourself the way he is. Is that

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:41:59.857Z)

I've always hoped

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:00.172Z)

true or just for one?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:01.557Z)

and and this could still be the case, and and I can tell you why.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:02.062Z)

Part of our platform? Yep. And our platform would have the ability

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:05.597Z)

Think Drew may be positioning himself the way he is.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:05.642Z)

use his his what he's developed is like a hyphen.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:08.527Z)

That Drew would just roll in and be part of our platform. And our platform would have the ability to use

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:10.242Z)

Right? Yeah. And then we go about trying to change the industry so that we

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:15.037Z)

his

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:15.092Z)

we change how people

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:15.907Z)

his what he's developed is, like, the piping. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:16.702Z)

process data. Right? And it becomes completely acceptable

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:19.947Z)

And then we go about trying to change the industry so that we

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:20.512Z)

to just have an owner send their information

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:23.957Z)

we change how people

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:24.522Z)

a search for piping. Into InvestAI.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:25.917Z)

process data. Right? And it becomes completely acceptable to just

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:27.252Z)

That's a I hope. Yeah. But then

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:30.437Z)

have an owner send their information up through Drew's piping into InvestAI.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:31.122Z)

into a role like us. Okay. Drew has made me go, like, on

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:36.037Z)

That's that's kind of always been my hope

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:36.422Z)

that he he wants be able to keep all

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:39.087Z)

But then and then drew a role into us.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:40.222Z)

options open. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:42.127Z)

Drew has maintained, though, like, on

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:42.232Z)

For now, to be considered just a vendor.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:45.357Z)

that he he that he wants to be able to

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:45.592Z)

A strategic vendor relationship for us. Alright. Now that that could be coming

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:48.017Z)

keep all his options open.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:50.562Z)

a couple of different

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:50.697Z)

And for now, he wants to be considered just a vendor.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:51.162Z)

reasons. You guys have you getting to know Drew as well. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:42:54.647Z)

Like, a strategic vendor relationship for us. Now that that could be coming from a couple different reasons.

### You (2025-05-05T13:42:57.742Z)

And he has 2,500, I promise, for getting this damn thing.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:01.677Z)

And you guys have you you're getting to know Drew as well. Right? He's been doing this for five years. And he has 2,500 hotels in his database.

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:07.362Z)

Do, like. To grow. Having been doing this for five years.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:11.727Z)

That's great. He's done a great job, but he's not growing probably as

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:11.792Z)

I think that maybe because he's going after the asset management model versus the deal model.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:15.347Z)

as fast as he'd like to grow having been doing this for five years.

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:17.202Z)

Mhmm. Personally. But but

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:20.317Z)

I think that maybe because he's going after it the asset management route versus

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:20.762Z)

that's kind of where he's He had his a partner

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:25.287Z)

the deal route.

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:25.482Z)

is his investor who is his technical partner.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:26.617Z)

Personally. But but

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:28.502Z)

And he has told me on a few different occasions that they're just more conservative.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:28.827Z)

but, that's kind of where he's He has

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:32.992Z)

Than theirs. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:33.127Z)

an partner that is he is an investor who is his

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:34.662Z)

And so that could factor into this. Another thing that could be factoring into this is he's not sure what

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:37.497Z)

technical partner, and he has told me on a few different occasions that they're just more

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:41.422Z)

be successful. Right? He might be buying his time to say,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:42.167Z)

conservative than he is. And so that could factor into this. And

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:45.062Z)

don't know if I wanna attach my cart to them if they're not gonna be successful because

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:47.227Z)

Another thing that could be factoring into this is he's not sure we're gonna be

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:50.312Z)

have 2,500 hotels.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:51.357Z)

successful. Right? He might be buying his time to say,

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:52.562Z)

Now other thing is he's talked to me on a few occasions about what I

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:43:54.857Z)

don't know if I wanna attach my cart to them if they're not gonna be successful because

### You (2025-05-05T13:43:56.962Z)

to settle this company. And then he could be angling at some sort of, you know, maybe

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:00.147Z)

have 2,500 hotels. Now the other thing is he's talked to me on a few occasions about wanting

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:04.192Z)

that this works and it could be a really

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:06.807Z)

to sell his company.

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:07.372Z)

know, amazing, like, key product. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:08.437Z)

For us.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:11.877Z)

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:12.172Z)

I'd like to roll it to you. But I have created something of value, and I want you to buy this from me.

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:49.482Z)

digital owner

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:51.577Z)

The Actables of the world could buy his company and have

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:52.212Z)

because they are facing the operational world. Right? So there's

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:44:55.617Z)

Drew lead a asset management driven

### You (2025-05-05T13:44:55.992Z)

no chance that maybe they buy this company. But then

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:00.657Z)

digital

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:00.922Z)

price a company like Trucks. Right? Because

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:02.177Z)

owner platform because they are facing the operational world. Right? So there's

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:03.522Z)

Yeah. That data go away. Moment. Right? And so what multiple are you gonna have to put

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:06.877Z)

there's more chance that maybe they buy his company, then you go back to the challenges. How do you price a company like Drew's? Right? Because

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:10.182Z)

Right? Like, what multiple are you actually using to price the data?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:14.887Z)

that data could go away at any moment. Right? And so what multiple

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:16.952Z)

So that's why, I guess, as I'm rambling, I wanna see if I can just sum this up.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:19.647Z)

are you you have to put I mean I mean, really right? Like,

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:22.302Z)

I still have hope

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:23.627Z)

what multiple are you actually using to price the data?

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:24.662Z)

that will want to join

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:28.177Z)

So that's why, I guess, as I'm rambling,

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:28.512Z)

us and be a partner. It could be that he's waiting to see what his options are for him to

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:31.197Z)

let me see if I can just sum this up. I still have hope

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:34.192Z)

waiting. To see if we're if we develop the sex Yeah. That that makes sense. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:36.017Z)

that Drew will want to join us and be a partner.

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:39.192Z)

Right. If you don't want to, I think

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:41.307Z)

It could be that he's just waiting to see what his opt

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:42.002Z)

think I'm gonna or the partners,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:44.597Z)

and waiting to see if we're if we develop a sex successful

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:46.922Z)

what's it worth? You know? Like, is it

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:48.877Z)

product.

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:49.042Z)

is it just his 20% share?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:50.197Z)

Right. If he if he does want to, I think I'm gonna

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:51.492Z)

If he told me the rest of us? Does that mean sense? And we're we're okay

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:54.057Z)

as partners,

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:55.702Z)

with that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:56.117Z)

gonna have to come together and say,

### You (2025-05-05T13:45:56.172Z)

If there's some sort of

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:45:58.217Z)

what's it worth? You know? Like, is it is it just his 20% share because he dilutes the rest of us? Does that make sense? And we're

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:05.342Z)

maybe she gets paid out.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:06.027Z)

we're okay with that. There some sort of earnout perhaps that happens, like, after certain hurdles are met on for us on revenue that then maybe he gets paid out in an

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:16.162Z)

That we as partners will have to

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:18.277Z)

earn in an earn out capacity or something like that.

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:18.932Z)

decide on. Yeah. And then in the interim, though, when we get to the

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:21.497Z)

Maybe that's possible. Or maybe it's his his data isn't really worth anything.

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:23.492Z)

point where we actually have a functioning

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:25.787Z)

That'll be something

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:26.412Z)

proof of

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:27.487Z)

that we as partners will have to decide on.

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:28.292Z)

concept think we are gonna need to put some definition to what

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:31.567Z)

And then in the interim, though, when we get to the

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:31.812Z)

better relationship looks like. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:34.587Z)

point where we actually have a functioning

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:34.942Z)

And and having that service, experience

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:37.867Z)

proof of concept, I think we are gonna need

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:39.492Z)

relationship? Where could help me to understand what

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:41.427Z)

to put some definition to what a vendor relationship looks like.

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:43.522Z)

to be. Defined or

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:45.817Z)

Right. And

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:46.852Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I have.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:46.967Z)

have you guys ever ex experienced that or have had a vendor relationship where you could help me to understand what

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:53.272Z)

And and there are multiple ways of going about it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:54.137Z)

needs to be defined or delineated in such an agreement?

### You (2025-05-05T13:46:56.912Z)

So one of the things that that that jumps out at me right now based on what you

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:46:58.287Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T13:47:03.172Z)

said is I think the best way to go about this as long as he is not really officially part of Invest, if he wants to be taking a partner or a vendor relationship would be that we just give him access to whatever we have in here. It's like, yeah. This is our data. This belongs to Invest. But since you are providing your data here, we're gonna give it data down here.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:47:29.857Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:47:32.362Z)

Right? So the properties that are not in HPIS be going down this route. So they would upload this information, and it all, at the end of the day, ends up in the same database. So we could always say, look, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:47:44.877Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:47:48.572Z)

We'll share. We'll share the data. Not a problem. Up until and then, you know, we we defined some guy ways of defining it, you know, at what point because you say he's got about 2,500 properties. That sounds like a very small percentage of the overall mark. Right? So sixty. Thousand. Yeah. Yeah. So we are gonna get the vast majority of our data here.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:48:18.197Z)

It is.

### You (2025-05-05T13:48:18.922Z)

On on the part where the users are providing it, not him.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:48:21.847Z)

It is. There's 68,000, so it's a small yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T13:48:23.322Z)

So it would be a bit a big benefit to him. To to get this data. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:48:29.197Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:48:31.972Z)

know, I don't think we'd wanna say you can have access to it in perpetuity. You know, you know, you can have access to it up until you either join us or use if you say no, you don't wanna join then you become a

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:48:48.027Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:48:49.392Z)

client of ours. And get the data. Other things that we have done go ahead.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:01.137Z)

Mhmm. How do you

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:06.392Z)

Something that I personally feel like I can't recreate at the hotel.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:09.367Z)

you get the idea, though, like, because, like, he

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:10.342Z)

Street. Right? Like, at the grand level, he's done it. It's taken him

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:13.157Z)

let me the mapping that he's done is not something that I personally feel

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:14.832Z)

years to do this. And so I see value in that. But do

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:19.737Z)

like I can

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:20.182Z)

you do you know the

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:20.607Z)

recreate in the hotel industry. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:21.702Z)

this is something that we can recreate on our own if we need to recreate

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:23.167Z)

at the granular level, he's done it.

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:25.632Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:25.727Z)

It's taken him years to do this, and so I see value in that.

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:26.072Z)

the the mapping that he's done? Yeah. Yeah. This is a classic

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:30.827Z)

But do you do you and Vinod think this is something that we could recreate

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:32.602Z)

build versus buy question.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:35.137Z)

on our own if we needed to recreate the

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:35.272Z)

Right? Yes. So anytime that you've got

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:37.777Z)

the the mapping that he's done?

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:39.222Z)

this type of functionality or you wanna try to do something new, you know, the question is

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:40.997Z)

Okay. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:43.832Z)

can I build it

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:49:45.457Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-05T13:49:45.742Z)

better and cheaper or is it best to go out and partner or even buy another company? Vinod, I'll let you you know, I've been doing all the talking here, but in terms of mapping the data, this is you know, we've been doing it at Red EyeQ for a long time. Yeah. We can definitely do a mapping. Thing on the thing. If we could provide the our original documents that we like. You know, for engineers to upload our platform.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:14.527Z)

Yeah. We can definitely do the map

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:16.472Z)

That would make it easier. But I'm sure we can do that

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:18.747Z)

The only thing if you could provide

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:20.472Z)

Thanks, Martin.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:21.767Z)

the our original documents that we expect

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:22.092Z)

If your order will go away, whatever reason. Right? We would

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:25.187Z)

you know, hoteliers to upload to our platform that would

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:25.322Z)

be screwed and we could figure out how to do our own mapping. And it would be

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:28.957Z)

make it easier, but I'm sure we can do that mapping.

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:30.422Z)

we try. Right away. Wouldn't, like, collapse or platform or anything like that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:32.257Z)

K. So if if Drew were to will go away for whatever

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:35.042Z)

We we have

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:36.147Z)

reason, right, we wouldn't be screwed, and we could figure out how to do our own mapping.

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:36.192Z)

yeah. I mean, that that cool way. To look anyway. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:40.067Z)

And it would be we'd be fine. Right? It wouldn't

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:42.292Z)

Us the data to be present,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:43.967Z)

wouldn't, like, collapse our platform or anything like that.

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:44.492Z)

already in our database. Then you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:46.997Z)

Yes. If

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:47.372Z)

we are being screwed up because we

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:49.087Z)

I mean, there there are two ways to look at it. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:49.592Z)

we have to find some other way, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:52.507Z)

If the user expect us the data to be present already in our database,

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:54.992Z)

And if the user test had the documents and they

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:58.017Z)

Then, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T13:50:58.802Z)

you know, them

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:50:59.247Z)

we'll be screwed up because we we'll have to find some other way, either SDR or

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:00.302Z)

to upload one. Platform and create mapping. That would be

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:04.217Z)

else to provide that data.

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:04.292Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:06.997Z)

And if the user does have the documents and they expect

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:08.002Z)

Alright. And my apologies, been that

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:10.787Z)

you know, them to upload 12 and we'll create the mapping, that should be doable.

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:11.612Z)

we whatever has to I mean, did upload data, but eventually we get to a point where that will have to happen

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:16.297Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:19.582Z)

more. Right? Because

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:20.267Z)

Right. And my hope all along has been that we

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:21.032Z)

it's already sitting in some operator

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:23.557Z)

no one ever has to I mean, like, how you guys did it at RedIQ with uploading the data,

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:24.062Z)

you know, BIs. System. And Drew can grab it from the operator. And so, technically, the owner should

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:28.527Z)

eventually we get to a point where that doesn't have to happen anymore. Right? Because

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:30.582Z)

never even have to touch this if it's Right. It it it

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:32.777Z)

it's already sitting in some operators'

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:34.672Z)

future vision. Right, turns out to be the case, but

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:35.867Z)

you know, BI system, and Drew can grab it from the operator And so technically, an owner should

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:38.172Z)

we're not anywhere near that yet. Yeah. Core of our

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:42.517Z)

never even have to touch this if if

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:42.792Z)

discussion there was that we won't to own the data. Right? Data is everything. As I said, they

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:45.777Z)

if the future vision, right, turns out to be

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:47.942Z)

So, you know, we have to focus on that. We can take it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:49.007Z)

the case, but we're not anywhere near that yet. Yeah. The core of our discussion, Diane, was that we want

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:52.802Z)

Email. That's not So we will clear

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:56.717Z)

to own the data. Right? Data is everything.

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:58.262Z)

to more

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:51:59.077Z)

As I said, data is the king. So if

### You (2025-05-05T13:51:59.762Z)

Yeah. From the user

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:01.507Z)

we have to focus on that. We can definitely create the application and all that. That's not

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:01.672Z)

from something. Way. But

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:06.097Z)

the main main thing is data.

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:06.912Z)

people that have

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:08.337Z)

We would really like to own the data either

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:08.742Z)

That's where

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:11.687Z)

from the user or from some API or whichever way. But, yeah, if we can become the data then that will be great. That's where we should folds.

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:19.132Z)

IQ or they're giving cost. The authority to capture and to optimize it right

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:22.317Z)

And and again, when you guys did this on the multifamily side, logistic

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:24.592Z)

Like, over over right? So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:26.717Z)

like, the owner technically owns the data. Right? But they're giving

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:27.062Z)

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And that goes back to what I mentioned before about

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:30.307Z)

RedeyeQ or they're giving us the authority

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:31.042Z)

when we sign an agreement,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:33.537Z)

to capture it, automize it. Right? Like right. So

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:34.152Z)

with a client. Part of that agreement will have that clause about aggregating and anonymizing the data, but they do have to have the option

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:52:38.267Z)

yep. Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T13:52:42.692Z)

to opt out. If they don't wanna share their data, that's fine because they do own the data. But if they check box and says I agree, then it's our data. To aggregate and and use and monetize. Another thing to keep in mind is that we are essentially developing a product that would be a direct competitor of your Alright. Right. Management as well. Right? Yeah. Right. And I'm not saying to use this as a strong-arm tactic. I just think it's one of those things where there would be synergy. It it would be better

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:53:16.217Z)

Right. Because we could go into asset management as well. Right? Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:53:16.862Z)

for us to join than to you know, put our put ourselves in a in a position where you're okay. Well, you know, if you don't wanna you don't wanna help us, then I guess we'll be competitors. But but yeah. I mean, all the data that he's giving us, we could eat

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:53:33.757Z)

Compete.

### You (2025-05-05T13:53:35.142Z)

just as easily get from the clients. And and

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:53:36.187Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:53:38.192Z)

the tools that we're putting together I mean, he's putting together a Power BI dashboard, and and that's

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:53:42.817Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:53:46.422Z)

that's just one step up from Excel. It's it's, you know, it's Got it. Something that's very, very easy to replicate. What I would see next

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:53:59.457Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-05T13:53:59.982Z)

day. Directly. To

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:03.977Z)

So, like, when in my mind, I see it as

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:05.222Z)

in terms

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:06.227Z)

it's something very easy to replicate. Because, like, if Drew were to go away, then what

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:08.352Z)

things where he gets some of his Yeah. And then

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:11.107Z)

would say next is then we need to go directly to

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:11.662Z)

for those

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:15.297Z)

Actable Autelier, which are two operational BI companies where he gets he gets some of his data from them.

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:19.152Z)

and Hyatt's and the Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:23.007Z)

And then for those

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:23.872Z)

get their data

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:24.387Z)

companies that don't contribute their data to him,

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:26.942Z)

he's doing. It's just

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:27.467Z)

then we have to go to the Marriott's and the Hilton's

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:29.522Z)

Pretty much. And I think we would have to

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:31.057Z)

and the Hyatt's and the Omni's and the IHG's of the world. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:33.482Z)

focus on

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:35.367Z)

And get their data, and we would just be doing it the exact same way he's doing

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:36.672Z)

the API. Portion.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:39.467Z)

it. It's just rolling it up and mapping it.

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:39.562Z)

Which would be we can create an API. And

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:43.087Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:44.192Z)

we would just tell Yeah. We just tell the Hiltons and the Marriotts, don't even have to upload anything. You don't have to do anything. You can correct. Connect directly to your system

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:53.467Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:54.512Z)

We'll map to whatever data you want, and all you have to do is I mean, we

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:54:56.627Z)

Provide the data.

### You (2025-05-05T13:54:58.682Z)

they don't even have to push a button. You know? You could set it to be automated to you know, we could get them data nightly, monthly, whatever we wanna do. Yeah. Because like you said at the beginning, I mean, the whole idea is to totally automate the system and not to have to rely on people typing in numbers or uploading

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:17.657Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:17.972Z)

Excel spreadsheets. Right? Okay. So right. Today. But and if fast think about this for a week or something like that. But one of the things I might about both of you as partners is that I think you're very smart.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:33.177Z)

So then let me and you don't have to answer this right today, but I

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:35.642Z)

And you're very fair. Right? You're

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:37.577Z)

and maybe it's best if maybe we just, like, think about this for a week or something like that. But

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:37.592Z)

you're I I don't wanna say, like, we have to protect ourselves, and we all know that. Right? But

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:42.007Z)

one of the thing

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:42.282Z)

you're you're not out of

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:43.187Z)

things I value about both of you as partners is that I think you're very smart.

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:43.502Z)

to, like, screw someone. Completely. Over. So I I asked, do you think over the next

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:47.947Z)

You're very fair. Right? You're

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:49.212Z)

week? You could

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:49.707Z)

you're I I don't wanna say it like we have to protect ourselves, and we all know that. Right? But

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:49.852Z)

think about how we should approach Drew about this?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:54.227Z)

you're you're not out to, like, screw someone completely over. So

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:54.412Z)

When we should approach Drew about this, you know, and maybe we could talk about what our

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:55:58.597Z)

I would ask, do you think over the next week, you could think about, how

### You (2025-05-05T13:55:58.722Z)

actual strategy is. Is it a network? Get through a proof of concept, and

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:03.207Z)

how we should approach Drew about this? Maybe when we should approach

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:04.012Z)

you know, gone up there, if that's the time to approach Drew about

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:07.637Z)

Drew about this, you know, and maybe we could talk about what our actual strategy is.

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:11.172Z)

to be part of our wants to

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:12.457Z)

Is it that when we get to a proof of concept and we've, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:13.342Z)

along. Give it, like, six months to nine months, and then

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:16.927Z)

gone is that the right

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:18.082Z)

wait.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:18.617Z)

moment in time to approach Drew about

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:18.772Z)

Until we approach Drew about this. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:21.657Z)

if he wants to be part of our company, or do we continue a

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:21.862Z)

So I think what I'm asking is for your, you know, for you guys

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:25.577Z)

the vendor relationship and give it, like, six months to nine months and then

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:25.742Z)

think about and it you know, people that I mean, this is all problem. Strength.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:30.387Z)

wait until we approach Drew about this.

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:30.762Z)

I I would in the world to us for putting our hearts and our souls and our

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:34.877Z)

So I guess what I'm asking is for your you know, for you guys to think about it.

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:35.062Z)

blood. Sweat, tears into this. But same time,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:38.797Z)

And as, you know, people that I mean, this is our product. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:38.902Z)

not to be you know, completely vicious. Right? And Oh, no. Yeah. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:42.777Z)

This means everything in the world to us. We're putting our hearts and our souls and

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:44.162Z)

Finger. Proposal out to Drew. So that I

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:46.757Z)

our blood and sweat and tears into this. But at the same time, not to be

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:47.482Z)

option to join us you want. Yeah. I I don't necessarily wanna compete against Drew. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:51.457Z)

you know, completely vicious. Right? And and to

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:53.362Z)

Right. Although, I I do have

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:55.457Z)

put a fair proposal out to Drew so that he has the

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:55.722Z)

study this as much as I've studied it. It really

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:56:59.527Z)

option to join us if he wants. Because the other thing is, I mean, I don't necessarily wanna

### You (2025-05-05T13:56:59.612Z)

think the way to create scale is to start an acquisition like product, like

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:03.927Z)

compete against Drew either, Although, I I do, having

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:07.802Z)

because people care more about that, you know, in my opinion, like, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:07.927Z)

studied this, as much as I've studied it, I really do think the way to create

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:12.012Z)

animals care about it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:13.887Z)

scale is to start with an acquisition

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:14.052Z)

CEOs care about it. And they can they just don't care about what

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:16.907Z)

like product, like an AVM.

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:17.842Z)

as much about acid. Management.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:19.957Z)

Because people care more about that in in my opinion, like, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:20.022Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:24.057Z)

analysts care about it. CEOs care about it.

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:24.132Z)

guys.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:28.097Z)

And they and they just don't care quite as much about asset management.

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:29.802Z)

Here?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:32.657Z)

Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate you both bringing this up to me. Have I missed anything that you think we should talk about here?

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:41.632Z)

Having all the data, like, the only

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:42.497Z)

Not. I

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:43.962Z)

thousand. Code, provided,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:46.597Z)

we are good. The only part is

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:47.712Z)

data. So what

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:49.277Z)

if we are developing our system

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:49.902Z)

he has day.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:52.067Z)

having all the data

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:52.192Z)

Go with the

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:57:55.237Z)

So 25,000 Dru will provide. Dru will always be our first vendor first data vendor. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:57:55.892Z)

Yeah. You know, we are fine. To just grab something from the user or we might

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:01.397Z)

Whatever he has available will

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:02.192Z)

explore the other. Options too.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:03.417Z)

definitely

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:04.012Z)

Some

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:04.697Z)

go

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:05.442Z)

true.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:05.667Z)

with him.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:06.032Z)

You know. Get all the data.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:06.847Z)

The rest of it, if, you know, we are

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:08.292Z)

From you. But I

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:09.247Z)

trying to, yeah, grab something from the user, but

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:09.382Z)

on the third option for the rest of the unavailable models that

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:13.457Z)

we might explore the other options too.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:13.712Z)

do this happen.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:16.537Z)

So first render is true. So, you know, we

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:16.732Z)

So probably need to think through that one. They

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:19.107Z)

get all the data from him.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:20.202Z)

can we get that data?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:21.037Z)

I was taking the third option for the rest of the

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:23.062Z)

Web

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:24.307Z)

unavailable hotels that

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:25.652Z)

see what has some basic information. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:25.967Z)

Drew doesn't have. He'll probably

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:30.022Z)

Rules, but they don't have financial information. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:30.457Z)

need to think through that too. Like, where can we get that data from?

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:32.732Z)

Right. Yes. And that's

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:34.177Z)

Mhmm. Web is scrapping. Yeah. You suggested that

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:35.752Z)

where those two AI companies

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:37.437Z)

has some basic information. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:37.882Z)

come in. That TruthPay a lot.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:39.997Z)

Mhmm. Conference room number of rooms, but they don't have financial information. Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:40.302Z)

Of his data. From. And then from there, it's coming from

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:44.967Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:45.172Z)

the brain Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:46.607Z)

Yes. And that's where those two operational BI

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:46.622Z)

If they bring in, it's if we don't so so we see, bear eye

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:49.627Z)

come in that Drew's getting a lot of his data from.

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:53.182Z)

you know, information.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:53.887Z)

Then from there, it's coming from

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:54.452Z)

Marriott is just franchising on the title, they'll

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:58:56.997Z)

the brands. Right? If if they brand manage. If they don't so so, like,

### You (2025-05-05T13:58:57.422Z)

have top line. Information, they'll only have rep information. And then to go get the p and l information from whatever

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:02.557Z)

say, Marriott is managing a hotel. They will have all the P and L information.

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:05.482Z)

manager that is. Manager, that's where

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:08.097Z)

If Marriott is just franchising a hotel, they'll only have

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:08.562Z)

doesn't it's quite going.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:11.657Z)

top line information. They'll only have revenue information.

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:13.092Z)

Owner. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:14.797Z)

And then you need to go get the p and l information from whatever

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:15.112Z)

take Sunstone, for example,

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:18.677Z)

property manager it is that's managing. And that's where Drew doesn't

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:18.792Z)

Sunstone's really to their owner their client's his, and they may cross five or six different managers companies. And so

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:24.187Z)

the way Drew's going after this is he's going after the owners. Right? So take

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:26.682Z)

he's getting up information. From the management company.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:30.447Z)

Sunstone, for example. Sunstone's a REIT. They're an owner. They're a

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:30.802Z)

But they're are lots of tons of management companies out there where it's not. Currently. Getting.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:35.417Z)

client of his, and they may cross five or six different management companies. And so

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:35.462Z)

The information. And so we be needing to go to those management companies

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:40.707Z)

he's getting that information from the management companies.

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:43.092Z)

a good zillion of them in the hotel space.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:44.027Z)

But there are obviously tons of management companies out there where he's not currently getting

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:49.172Z)

20 of them in the

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:49.487Z)

the information. And so

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:50.042Z)

institutional space.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:51.487Z)

would be needing to go to those management companies

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:52.212Z)

If that makes sense. Right? So it's not like

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:54.827Z)

So the good news is there's not a gazillion of them in the hotel space. There's

### You (2025-05-05T13:59:54.872Z)

talk about 5,000 different management companies. They're it's unfair.

### Guest (2025-05-05T13:59:59.767Z)

probably only a hundred to a 20 of them in the institutional

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:01.152Z)

Number. Try to go out and and and see, like, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:05.147Z)

space, if that makes sense. Right? So it's not like

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:05.742Z)

happen. Eye and and if you wanna once

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:08.557Z)

we're talking about 5,000 different

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:09.282Z)

to transfer the information, then I think they'll transfer

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:11.417Z)

management companies. There's it's it's a very manageable number to

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:12.652Z)

the information.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:15.847Z)

try to go out and

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:15.912Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:17.547Z)

and and to, like, you know, create an API and if the owner wants them to transfer the information, then I think they'll transfer

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:22.202Z)

Thing. Like, discuss more about it. Yes. Yes. So it was

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:26.717Z)

the information.

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:27.612Z)

been week. If you have thoughts

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:29.957Z)

That's yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna end up.

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:33.742Z)

dress right. To approach Drew. I would love to get your

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:35.027Z)

Reconnect and think, like, discuss more about it.

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:37.162Z)

thoughts on that so we're all aligned.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:38.697Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:39.102Z)

K. Can start that process.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:40.377Z)

Yeah. So if you guys like, over the next week, if you have thoughts about

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:42.632Z)

Alright. Yeah. I I think I can do that. Let me

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:44.647Z)

how, when, and

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:45.402Z)

let me continue working on this

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:46.177Z)

how, when, and where, I guess. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:48.382Z)

data model.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:48.707Z)

To approach Drew, I would love to get your thoughts on that so we're all aligned and

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:49.282Z)

And Okay. With with the node on on that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:53.077Z)

can

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:53.162Z)

And I think the best thing to do would be to

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:00:53.837Z)

can start that process. Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T14:00:56.152Z)

see what options are available because something that just

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:01:01.067Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T14:01:01.092Z)

occurred to me now is, you know, you'd you'd mentioned about the mapping. That I'm not concerned about the mapping. That's that's not a difficult thing to replicate. I know it took them a while, but you know, I think both Node and I have been doing this for a few years. He was probably starting from scratch, but either way. But, you know, one thing also is, you know, when I showed on that workflow, you know, first thing it does is hit the HPIS database to see if the data is there. If If it is, then it pre populates. If it's not, it goes down to our process. Which that's where I would interpret that we would then do the mapping. We would do all that. But there's a process We could kinda go a little roundabout saying, okay, well, it's not in the HPIS data database, but let's use Drew's product to extract and map the data since he's already got it done.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:01:53.367Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:01:55.292Z)

Then you go around, you know, there there's different things that we could do But I do still think, you know, being the old you know, being the old boy scout, you wanna be prepared. That, you know, we do still wrapping. We do still need to have that because we will have clients that are not in HPIS, then we have say, okay. Well, which is the best way to do this? And that's going to depend on Drew's

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:18.047Z)

Yeah. I know. Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:20.042Z)

response to how how he wants to handle the data. So Okay. So, yeah, we'll keep working on that. Okay. I'm calling there. I guess week to offer another lift? Of where we could get that data. Like send you Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:37.267Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:37.372Z)

Web to It's all at for a certain reason.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:40.607Z)

And, Howard, in the

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:41.782Z)

Reason. And then a couple of other like, who's

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:44.167Z)

this week too, I'll work on a list of where I

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:46.132Z)

aggregating

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:47.187Z)

we could get that data. You know what I mean? Like, I'll send you

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:48.782Z)

like, works

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:50.207Z)

the web websites to who's already

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:53.682Z)

Yeah. So but almost

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:54.117Z)

aggregating it for certain reasons, and then a couple of other providers

### You (2025-05-05T14:02:55.512Z)

all those companies Alright. Yeah. That'll be very helpful because I

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:02:58.817Z)

like Hot Stats who's aggregating it. But they're not aggregating it

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:00.052Z)

I'm not familiar with any of them. So that would be very helpful.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:02.317Z)

any kind of, like, workflow automation. They're just aggregating it

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:03.802Z)

So, yeah, that

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:05.847Z)

for data aggregation. So but I'll I'll send you a list of all those

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:06.612Z)

in terms then of budgeting and and financing then too, we do need to have

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:10.517Z)

companies.

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:12.912Z)

a safety net in case, well, what happens if Drew says, no, I

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:15.787Z)

Mhmm. Yep.

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:18.972Z)

don't wanna do this. Then we have to go to other companies to get that data and no. I I don't have any idea what it would cost. And and I don't know if we have any I would call friendly contacts in any of those companies that we can maybe you know, just have a introductory conversation or or I don't know whether you or Mark have any of those contacts. I do think we'd wanna have at least a ballpark idea of of what it might cost

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:52.947Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:54.812Z)

and at the same time, we have to be

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:03:57.357Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:03:57.432Z)

upfront with them to make sure that we could use their data, make sure that they don't have any fine print about reselling. So I I don't wanna find myself in the situation that I was at Red IQ where

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:04:07.627Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:04:11.952Z)

So So check together. Just, like, on the fence about how even do what projections because we sit this juncture between

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:02.437Z)

So I need the well, this is on me, but I've gotta get the budget together. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:03.042Z)

between little stuff like and price. Store and how AI is

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:07.137Z)

And then I'm a little just, like, on the fence about how I even

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:07.532Z)

interesting. Impacting like, going forward. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:11.807Z)

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:12.082Z)

That I I I have to think through how to present that to an investor. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:15.637Z)

between

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:17.192Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:17.577Z)

between how software had been priced historically and how AI is impacting

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:17.912Z)

I have, like, in my like, I have a list of probably I don't know, 60 different groups I'd like to start approaching

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:22.157Z)

impacting pricing going forward. That, I'd

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:25.402Z)

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:26.927Z)

I I have to think through how to present that to an investor.

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:26.992Z)

proof of concept together. Right? And I'm ready I'm pretty much ready to go.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:30.997Z)

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:31.612Z)

Put a small pitch deck together. But I

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:32.257Z)

I have, like, in my like, I have a list of probably, I don't know, 50 different

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:35.122Z)

I because I know this pain so well, I know

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:37.227Z)

groups I'd like to start approaching once we get

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:37.282Z)

exactly what I'm gonna I'm gonna start I'm gonna start

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:40.597Z)

the

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:41.372Z)

some

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:41.567Z)

proof of concept together. Right? And I'm ready. I'm pretty much ready to go. I've

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:41.772Z)

groups. That might call for portfolio. That need internal

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:45.847Z)

gotta put a small pitch deck together. But, I I

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:48.742Z)

customer.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:49.677Z)

because I know the space so well, I know exactly who I'm gonna I'm gonna start with family offices.

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:50.282Z)

Because of the just the nature of that time consuming work. I also

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:54.497Z)

I'm gonna start with some groups that might have portfolios

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:56.062Z)

personally I would like to try to

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:05:57.997Z)

that need internal valuation work, and they might be willing

### You (2025-05-05T14:05:59.142Z)

target maybe. A few.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:01.527Z)

to be signed on as a customer of ours, right, because of the

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:03.032Z)

Debt platforms. That are focusing specifically on hospitality

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:05.597Z)

just the nature of that time consuming work.

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:08.112Z)

how to

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:08.877Z)

I'd also, personally, I'd like to try to

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:09.102Z)

equity, acquisitions right now is still very slow. But everyone is trying to refinance their hotels. And so

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:14.197Z)

target maybe a few debt

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:16.762Z)

our platform, right,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:17.727Z)

debt

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:18.062Z)

works for

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:18.317Z)

platforms that are focusing specifically on hospitality because

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:18.832Z)

refinancing and for financing work as well for valuation on financing.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:23.287Z)

equity

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:23.982Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:24.347Z)

acquisitions right now is still very slow.

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:25.072Z)

so I think it's I think when we get to

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:27.537Z)

Everyone is trying to refinance their hotels. And so our platform, right,

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:28.092Z)

the point of the proof of concept that I need, to do is sit down and present to you

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:32.267Z)

works for refinancing. It works for financing work as well for valuation

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:32.432Z)

all. Like, this is how we're gender or this is how I'm in love. Our team to approach

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:36.907Z)

on financing.

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:38.292Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:38.387Z)

So

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:38.652Z)

fundraising

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:39.557Z)

so I think it's I think when we get to the point of the proof of concept and what I need

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:39.612Z)

and the marketing and the trying to find a couple of groups to test

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:44.077Z)

to do is sit down

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:45.192Z)

the product with us.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:45.647Z)

present to you all like,

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:47.492Z)

No. That that that makes sense. On the revenue side, I I took

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:47.827Z)

this is how we're gonna or this is how I'd like our team to approach the fundraising and the marketing and the trying to find a couple

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:52.462Z)

some time to review that document that I put together with AI.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:06:57.497Z)

of of groups to test the product with us.

### You (2025-05-05T14:06:58.422Z)

And I think the revenue was actually pretty close. At least the at least the assumptions were in in the timeline I think we're pretty good. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:09.837Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:11.372Z)

So we can go back. Put more emphasis on reading through that and seeing Well, yeah. I mean, right now, revenue is just like, you know, putting on a blind

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:19.337Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:20.772Z)

and throwing a dart at the board. You know? It's like,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:23.797Z)

So maybe go back and put more emphasis on

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:24.912Z)

because, you you know, you you did mention all the different changes. But I think

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:28.407Z)

on reading through that and seeing, what it

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:29.082Z)

even if we just use that as a template,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:31.317Z)

yep.

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:31.752Z)

what was in there, You know, I'm not saying every number was perfect. But we could take those numbers and and tweak them. And at least we've got a template, you know, a place to start. So so let's let's just take a look at that. And, you know, if we wanna set up another we can set up another call, a little workshop where we can just get everybody together and

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:07:54.047Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:07:54.382Z)

see do we do we agree with these assumptions, what do we wanna change,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:01.267Z)

Okay. Yep. Thank you. I do have one other challenge I'd like to just, put out there for you guys. It the three of us to brainstorm on, and that is to me, Mark is a wonderful partner because he's a former broker and, like,

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:23.382Z)

Right. Tool for

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:26.587Z)

he just resonates with the capital market with capital markets people. Right? But my one challenge is when Mark sees this product,

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:32.572Z)

evaluation.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:34.457Z)

he sees it only as a tool for acquisition people.

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:35.132Z)

Deal flow process. Right? Natural acid. Managers.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:38.707Z)

And I see it as a tool for lenders acquisition people, appraisers, like anyone who does evaluation

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:46.872Z)

People. That's true.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:47.817Z)

has to sort through some sort of deal flow process, right, including eventually ask

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:48.752Z)

Gonna do a tool for acquisition a people. But I

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:52.577Z)

managers,

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:53.092Z)

so I I had a

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:53.967Z)

be but in Mark's mind, when we he and I talk, he's like,

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:54.492Z)

a little bit of a challenge getting that through. To him. Yeah. I'm Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:08:58.197Z)

Diane, you told me this was a tool for acquisition people.

### You (2025-05-05T14:08:59.062Z)

I've had the same feeling. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:01.367Z)

And that's true. I did tell him it was a tool for acquisition people.

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:01.852Z)

So I've I don't know how to solve that because I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:05.107Z)

But it's also a tool for lenders. And so I I'm having

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:05.932Z)

I don't see what he can't see. That.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:08.817Z)

a little bit of a challenge getting that through to him.

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:09.122Z)

Bigger the opportunity and more revenue. There.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:11.807Z)

You know, that

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:12.582Z)

Right? And and the more

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:14.487Z)

yeah. So I just I don't know how I'm gonna

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:14.692Z)

someone would want to buy into our platform. Yeah. Of an investor perspective.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:18.077Z)

solve that because, I mean, I don't see why

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:19.432Z)

That's that's one reason why I'm putting together these workflows.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:21.607Z)

he can't see that

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:22.962Z)

A lot of it was kinda spurred on by some of the questions Mark had.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:23.497Z)

the opportunity, the more revenue they're exists. Right? And then and the more someone would want to buy into our

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:29.292Z)

So I am actually planning on putting together a very similar work

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:30.847Z)

platform from an investor perspective go go ahead, Howard.

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:34.112Z)

for each persona that we have. Investor, broker, asset manager, lender, You know, I'm gonna show the whole walk through, which basically is gonna be the same. It's just gonna be it's like no. You know, it's like, mark you're you're looking at one fourth of of the market.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:54.167Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T14:09:54.962Z)

And then you're yeah, and and you're only looking at the subscription revenue, which is

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:09:58.897Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:10:01.452Z)

I mean, we'll be eating at McDonald's every meal if that's what we're depending on. It's it's about the data. And so if we can get four times the data,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:10:08.307Z)

Of the revenue opportunity. Right? Yes. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T14:10:10.792Z)

In fact, one of the things I wanted to talk to him about is how our very first and initial marketing effort should be towards brokers.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:10:19.047Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:10:19.922Z)

And I'm going to show in this workflow why. Because one of the things that we had at Red IQ that I think is huge is the ability to share a model. K? So let's say I'm a broker. I could use Invest AI. I would upload all this in. I I would create the deal. I would get all the way through the process to the valuation model. Because number one, I want to know what do I think I can sell this property for. But they wouldn't have that valuation model I'm going to say, hey, Diane, investor. Take a look at this model. Tell me what you think. Hey, Vinod, other investor, take a look at this model. And what I would do is I would

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:11:04.077Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:11:05.262Z)

share that model so you don't have to do any of that front end process. I've already done it for you. And as a broker, I would be heavily incentivized to take on that responsibility. Right? But now you can get in there and you can take that model. You can change it. You can tweak it. You know, your financing assumptions or cap rate, etcetera, You know, imagine me being able to take

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:11:26.717Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:11:28.572Z)

as a broker, create a model and share it with a hundred people. Right? Right. I don't even have to really reach out directly. We could create, like, a marketplace.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:11:36.437Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:11:38.022Z)

Where a broker could set it up. And then if he wants to, he could check a box and say, yeah. Any Invest AI investor account

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:11:43.047Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:11:49.262Z)

can take a look at this. And then all of a sudden, you've got yourself

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:11:51.117Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T14:11:53.152Z)

the Zillow of hotels. Right? Where they can do that. So that's the thing that I think Mark has a difficult time grasping is because it it you know, he does see it just as a

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:03.187Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:04.922Z)

a replacement of Excel. And and this is way more than just an Excel replacement. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:11.347Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:12.442Z)

Right. Want to have a thousand of 50 Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:26.437Z)

Right. Right. And there are moments when he'll have a as an epiphany, but then, like, the next day, the epiphany goes away. You know what? It's and it's like, no. Mark, you're right. So but you guys understand the reason why I like Mark's background so much is

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:35.332Z)

National NMHC conference probably. Yes. Exactly.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:38.767Z)

you've never what's the multifamily conference? The huge

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:39.712Z)

Exactly. So there are two of those conferences. In the hotel.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:43.737Z)

annual multifamily conference that exists every year. It's called

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:43.952Z)

Industry. Right? And he's

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:48.747Z)

right? So there

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:49.622Z)

Yeah. He like the like, he just

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:51.337Z)

yes. Exactly. So

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:53.052Z)

do that. But, sadly, I I don't think, you know, anything works much better if you have someone

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:12:55.167Z)

there are two of those conferences in the hotel industry. Right? And you put Mark on a stage with the right script, and he's a former broker. Right?

### You (2025-05-05T14:12:58.682Z)

actually So Well, that's that's what I've been thinking lately is

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:04.147Z)

He he like, the like, he just

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:05.232Z)

I need I need I've been trying to treat Mark as a potential client.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:06.787Z)

wish I could do that, but, I I don't think you know? I think it works much better if you have someone who actually was in the capital markets

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:10.572Z)

And educating him like this because that's exactly what I thought. It's like,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:15.137Z)

space themselves. So

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:16.452Z)

if we can get Mark to be our evangelist, and get out there and and evangelize it to the brokerage community

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:24.287Z)

It's

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:25.752Z)

I mean, that would be a huge start even before we get us one investor client. Right? We if we can get the brokers out there using it and then going from there, then we just open it up

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:34.727Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:37.872Z)

to investors. I mean, it it doesn't have to be you know, straight line. You know, obviously, we wanna go to all the markets on day one. But Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:13:45.407Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T14:13:48.762Z)

But, yeah, that's that's Yeah. I kinda view him as as our broker subject matter expert. And Yes. Yes. I'm so glad you it that way. Yeah. Because some there are some things I'm like, come on, Howard. Come back to your office. But I but I'm like,

### Guest (2025-05-05T14:14:02.757Z)

Right. Yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-05-05T14:14:10.012Z)
