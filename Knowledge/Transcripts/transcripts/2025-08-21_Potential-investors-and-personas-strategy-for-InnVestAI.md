# Transcript for: Potential investors and personas strategy for InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-08-21T12:59:50.066Z)

Good morning.

### You (2025-08-21T12:59:51.266Z)

Hey, good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2025-08-21T12:59:52.786Z)

Good, good. How are you?

### You (2025-08-21T12:59:54.626Z)

Doing all right. Keep him busy.

### Guest (2025-08-21T12:59:58.146Z)

Deep and busy. So I think I found our first investor. And maybe our second one as well. So, do you have a minute for me to do the rundown?

### You (2025-08-21T13:00:08.706Z)

Yeah, I got all the time in the world.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:00:11.026Z)

Okay, so this is a true friends and family, right? This is a long term friend of mine. And I know that I'm probably personally taking some risk that this could impact our friendship. But he's assured me that if he loses the money, it's no big deal, and that's my risk to take here. His name is mike sherbin. We grew up together in avon lake, ohio. He is an attorney. He is an mba. That doesn't. That's not as big of a deal. And he's also an engineer. I thought it was accounting, but, gosh, 30 years ago. You forget what people actually majored in. Back in the day, right? He is a patent attorney, and he's also been an internal gc. And now he started his own business. It's an ESOP business. So the business is where employees want to. A founder looks to employees to buy out their share, and he structures all of that for them. He wants to invest 50k. He's already gone through and developed our cap stack for us. I'm kind of joking about that. He hasn't. Right. But he walked me through all the math yesterday on it. He's like, you should issue a million shares and you should put 150k shares. Away for your employees, and you guys take the other 950. And he just walked through all of it. He would like. If this is. If we're open to this, and this is what I wanted to talk to you about, because I think this will really. As I was reflecting on the conversation last night, He's an attorney. So if you were to put us on a spectrum of personality, I'm, like, over here, optimistic. And he is the. Let's think about the downside scenario, right? What happens in the downside scenarios?

### You (2025-08-21T13:02:03.986Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:02:04.466Z)

In fact, we walk through the llc, and he was walking. Okay, what happens in this scenario? What happens in this scenario? So he would like. He talked about us having a board, like a true board, right? But like Jessica, he also talked about us having a very small, more involved board. Right. Like Jessica was talking about, and he would like to do something like that.

### You (2025-08-21T13:02:25.346Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:02:29.586Z)

That would probably fall on you and me the most. Right. Because I think we could. We would all talk to him maybe, like, monthly or quarterly, but you and I might be talking to him more because I feel like we're kind of like the core and Drew two, right. And. But like, we do the coordination between technology. And business. And I think it would also help just marks a pretty well mark also thinks about the downside, but I just think it would probably be better from a cadence perspective. I think this could help us because things like. What did you bring up yesterday? Your subscription to MGX? Was that it? That was $70 a month. Like for us to be struggling with stuff like that and have to say, we'll be back in a couple of days. Is kind of right. And what I see happening is Drew and Mark agreed to split this, which I feel very grateful for. But I see Drew participating more, maybe. I don't know if Mark has actually paid for anything yet or if it's all been Drew. Do you by chance have a sense of that?

### You (2025-08-21T13:03:41.266Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:03:42.626Z)

Okay? Because I know Drew put the product subscriptions that Vinod needed on his credit card. And then I think Drew wired Vinode money to pay the software engineers.

### You (2025-08-21T13:03:51.026Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:03:57.426Z)

And I don't know that. I mean, we'll figure it out when we start to do reimbursements. He also, obviously, this is something that you and I need to start getting paid. Write something. It's not like a full amount or anything, but like a couple K a month. That could help us pay mortgage payments or something along those lines. And then I'll just go back to also his own company. Because he has his own very small company. But he's very interested in the idea of creating an LLM, and that's kind of what we're doing, too. Like, the data, I mean, would essentially be like an LLM that we're going to gather. Right. For the hospitality industry. So I think he looks at this as an opportunity to kind of co learn at the same time. Right. We're going to be trying to figure out what, you know, this is a data lake, but how do we make it secure and how do we make it very usable for the industry? And he's gonna, he's trying to figure that out for him self. He's a very nice person. I've never seen him get angry at anything. I've never seen him blow up at anything. He's very calm and collected. He just is an attorney, and so he's always thinking about downside risk.

### You (2025-08-21T13:05:12.386Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:05:13.826Z)

He is shocked to think that we could get 50 to 100 million in ARR. I'm not obviously right, because it still scares me every day. But I look at actable. I looked at other platforms. At other platforms and especially how to your point, all we really have to do is have a currency converter. And Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, Corey, they're all global Berends So the hospitality industry is so much easier to penetrate a global market than any other commercial real estate sector.

### You (2025-08-21T13:05:51.106Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:05:52.626Z)

So I wanted to. So that's one. Now let me flip to the other. I'm talking with carlos rodriguez jr. Tomorrow. We talked with Manny. He was the chief technology officer that we did that demo with.

### You (2025-08-21T13:06:07.026Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:06:08.466Z)

As I've been trying to get creative and figure out how to get some money just so we can start to survive. I've been texting with him and offered up the idea. That if I provided part time assets management services to get him through budget season and maybe through, like, January and February. Because he lost his asset manage. His lead asset manager went to Trinity, where that's Drew used to work for Trinity. Would he be then interested in Investing? Call it 70.75k into InnVestAI with a safe note. Right. So he's getting value out of it because my time is probably more than the 75k he'd be investing. It's going to be hard on me because I'll have to manage the two things during budget season. But if we're doing beta's with a couple of banks in October, November, December, it may more fall on to like you and Drew, right, to be working very closely with the beta clients. And so I don't know if he'll agree to that or not. He said in the Texas weekend he liked the idea and to get on to his calendar this week. So he could say no to it in the end. But I am gonna try to pitch it if he would invest 75k into us. That would be a great validation stamp in the hospitality industry. Right. Because he's an owner and he's also a Persona. Right. Like, the more we could work with them and domino what they're doing internally, we've got one Persona covered, which is the owner. Right. The investor. And then I was thinking about this. If Mark can get Dan Lesser to invest, who's the Lark guy? That's a Persona. That's an appraiser. Right. So now we have two Personas. And if we could get Peach Tree Hotels, who we've talked about doing some beta work for them. And Mark knows the head. We both know the chief investment officer. That would be the third Persona, which is a bank, Right? A lender. So now we're starting to get Personas that we're working with. Does this make sense? And we would need to fill in then with a broker Persona. Probably a pure hotel manager Persona. And maybe a brand Persona like this. And then we'd have six Personas that we would have, like, in our cap stack. Right. That we would also be working with. To try to develop how the product needs to vary for each Persona. Okay, so I rambled. What are your thoughts? Pros, cons. Like, what kind of. What are your. Just. What's your reaction?

### You (2025-08-21T13:09:06.866Z)

I think it's very exciting. Obviously getting anybody who's interested in the duel is good. I was excited yesterday when you mentioned about the potential opportunity to get that money from Mike. I'm very grateful that you are willing to trade off your time. For potential investment from the other. Certainly hope that it works out. And then want to make sure that part of that 75,000 goes not just straight to InnVestAI but you are compensated somehow. I would consider that. But I like the idea of all of it. There's nothing that really concerns me about it. I like that we're focusing on getting, whether you call it a board, advis ory mentor, all of the above. I think that's something that we really need because we've got five very talented people. In their respective areas. Who have never started a business. I think we've got the whole hospitality, AVM and all of the associated products covered. But it doesn't mean anything. If we can't effectively go to market with it. So I think getting them involved in a board of some sort is great. And I do think that we definitely need to talk to Mike about how are we going to do the equity and ESOPs and everything else like that, because we've had conversations where it's great. To have five founders at 20%. But in order to get employees in a startup, you have to offer them a piece of the action. So. Yeah, I don't know how we set that up and split it. That's way out of my area. So I think getting that addressed at the very beginning is a very good idea. Let's have as many conversations as we can with them and try to get something up. Speaking of Personas.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:11:50.786Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-21T13:11:57.506Z)

Appraisers. Where do they fit into our six? Would they be the consultant or do we want to have a specific appraiser? Group. And here's the reason I ask it. I had a call yesterday. With. Gentleman. His name is clint. Clint taller. He was with jll for 10 years. In kind of their technical side. And basically he was the right iq. Point of contact. And his role was basically to vet and work with any outside technology outside of jll. He recently left. To join some other former JLL colleagues that are now working with a company that. 's basically an appraiser. Group team. I forgot the name of it. I'd have to pull up my notes to see if I can get that somewhere. I know I had it open. Yeah. Partner Vale partner Val or something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:13:14.706Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-21T13:13:15.026Z)

If I wrote it down correctly. I don't know if you've heard of them or not. But anyway, long story short is they do almost all multifamily, but they do have what he said was a small number that also do hotels. Well, actually, I take that back. They're not multifamily. They're manufactured housing. So totally different area. But like I said, he does have some appraisers. And he's very good with technology, and his job was to search out future things, and so we started talking about AI and what he's doing with it. And I wrote down a bunch of ideas. In fact, that's the one where I asked about that company in Texas.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:14:07.746Z)

The restaurant and bars.

### You (2025-08-21T13:14:09.346Z)

He mentioned that JLL team used to use them because they knew that there's a fixed tax rate in Texas. So if you knew what the tax amount was, you could reverse back and know exactly what their revenues were.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:14:09.426Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-21T13:14:24.546Z)

And he mentioned a few other things that we're working on. So we want to keep in touch, and we're going to probably meet maybe every other month or so just to kind of get caught up. But that got me thinking, too, because he said that obviously there's a good opportunity for us to work together with appraisers using ours, because he mentioned that. It takes. It takes, like, 18 hours for an appraiser to go through and just do the paperwork and everything. His goal is in the next six months or so to get that down to six to eight hours. Using technology, and so he thought what we were doing on the valuation side would be pretty beneficial. But then I started thinking, well, we've got all these Personas, but we don't have a specific appraiser Persona. And I thought, Do you have a lot of contacts in the appraiser? Would just log in with the consultant.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:15:28.946Z)

Yeah, so. Yes, so I have. So mark. And mark knows dan lesser and evan weiss. The majority of their businesses, hotel appraisal work. Right. So if Dan Lesser decides to invest in us on the account of Dan Lesser. Not Lesser, in Weiss.

### You (2025-08-21T13:15:47.586Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:15:48.866Z)

I mean, I believe. I mean, I believe this with everyone. The world's gonna change so much, right? The appraisal industry is gonna be turned on its head with this. So? So Dan Lesser, he could bring that expertise to a board, right? Because that's his business. He also does advisory work. It's lumped together. Like if you're going to build a new hotel. And you don't really need an appraisal yet. You need a market study. He does that type of work. He does expert witness work, which is highly compensated and highly risky. So he could be a great person. He believes in technology. He just couldn't figure out and his mind how to get the ROI on it because he was thinking of it in a smaller scale. He's great. He's beloved in the industry. Well, should I say pull up in the industry. He's well regarded in the industry, but he's also a bit like Mark. He's very cagey, a little bit right, like close to the vest. And I don't know why I'm. Saying this, but just so, you know, kind of always personality. He's also. People would call him a bit greedy as well. Right. Like, it's like, it's all about Evan and Dan at Lesser and Weiss, and they have a very big team, but it's like, it's the Evan and Dan show. Is what people call it.

### You (2025-08-21T13:16:51.746Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:17:10.946Z)

So he could fill that role for us. And if he wrote a check, he might want to kind of be closer in, right? In, like, an. Like an advisory board. The other person I know in this person that I like better as a person. Right. But in fairness, I don't know Dan all that well is a woman named Stacey Neldoni. She was with HVS, and she ran the Midwest Hotel practice. She's now at Western Alliance. So I talk to her at Western. Alliance on regard for banking. But I'm good. 15 minutes of our discussion was around appraisal as well. And that how long is it going to take an appraiser? And she went through. She's like, you guys are really smart to do this because she knocked through. HVS has lost its reputation over the last five years. They're not really doing anything like this. She said Lesser and Weiss isn't doing anything like this. And she knocked through like, three or four other groups that do appraisal work in the hotel industry. And commented on the fact that they don't do this. Their founder is looking to exit the business. In many cases, like some of the senior HVs, people are looking to exit the business. And, like, mike esop business, I guess. So stacy's former boss at hvs is a guy named rod. Very well known in the industry. He wants Stacy to buy him out. Right? And Stacy's like, why would I go buy him out when I helped create that business in the first place? Right. She's not at HBS anymore. And what's it worth going forward? You know what I mean? That just seems so crazy. And she mentioned that pattern is happening across the businesses that were formed back in the early 90s by founders who had great success, but now can't find anyone to actually sell their business to. So Stacy could be a great person as well. So those are two. I mean, Dan may be the more practical person, since he's actually potentially writing a check. Mark's trying to get him in as an investor.

### You (2025-08-21T13:19:22.546Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:19:23.586Z)

But Stacy is by far a nicer. And she's very smart and creative, too. She was the first person I talked to. I'm sorry I'm rambling so much. But when we were going through the idea and she was, like, wrapping her head around it, and she was like, okay, I understand. She said, the security issue is going to be a problem with Western Alliance. Like, you guys are going to have to think through that. But she said, we also have an incubator group, JL and brcading everything.

### You (2025-08-21T13:19:56.066Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:19:56.466Z)

And then she went on to say, and I was talking about workflows and legal and workflows and Capex. And she's like, oh, my God, Diane. She's like, the Berends would be interested in this, like, actually Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt. Right. Because their workflows are so manual to and she was. I just thank God because she was the first person, right. That just caught that immediately. Like, that's a very big opportunity to go try and work with the thousand pound gorillas, which we do all have contacts within those brands. It's not like it's a, it's. We have friends that. Work there. So that's. So I rambled, but that's my idea. But. But if your friend would be interested in something like this as well. I mean, it's going to be interesting what he views as the future of appraisal to. Did he mention that at all? What he thinks is going to happen to appraisers.

### You (2025-08-21T13:20:50.546Z)

No, we didn't really get into into that so much. It was more or less getting caught up, you know, because he was still with JLL when I left, and then I heard that he had moved on. So we just kind of touch base to kind of see what each each other's doing and going from. There, but, I mean, we can certainly have more conversations with him, so.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:21:12.546Z)

Yeah. But I think they're a huge user of the product, and we want to make sure we have a Persona in the mix. That's appraisal, right? Because cbre, well, it was a capital markets team, loved redIQ. But the valuation team, the appraisers, loved Red IQ too, so it covered both arms.

### You (2025-08-21T13:21:35.026Z)

My assumption would be that they probably would not need to get down into the weeds, that they would be more of the higher level, like the lenders and the servicers. Or would they need to get down into the line items of the food and beverage and other. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:21:53.106Z)

No. This appraisers are still at a pretty high level. They're at a more granular level than a bank. But nowhere near what an owner or operator does, right?

### You (2025-08-21T13:22:03.266Z)

So they could be part of the initial beta. Or maybe the second wave beta. If we start off with lenders and servicers. And then maybe get some appraisers and go from there. Okay? My two cents. Is. Based on what you've told me, I would probably rather work with Stacy. Even if he writes a check. I think we have to be wary of. Anybody who writes a check gets a seat on the board type of thing. Then my fear is that those people on the board then would think, well, whoever writes the biggest check. Is more in charge, right?

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:22:55.506Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-21T13:22:57.026Z)

So I don't want to associate. Those two, they have to be separate. We have to have people on the board who have skin in the game. We have to have other ones that are not as biased.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:23:00.786Z)

Check writing. Y.

### You (2025-08-21T13:23:16.226Z)

If your assessment of his personality is correct, he sounds like he'd be somebody who would want to control and make decisions and maybe over influence what we do.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:23:27.026Z)

Eah. I may have over. I've been negative about that, right?

### You (2025-08-21T13:23:34.386Z)

We may be wrong, but I'm just saying this is kind of what we need to focus on. When it does come to boards and advisor tweets, they probably need to make a decision in advance. Is, how many people are we going to put on board? Right. Do we need? Five, seven, two. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:23:54.226Z)

Right now, two people have emerged that have different skill sets, right, Jessica? Clearly knows the tech space and the hospitality space, but the tech space, right?

### You (2025-08-21T13:24:03.586Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:24:03.986Z)

And she knows all the revenue, and so I think she could help. And she's been a founder herself, so she brings a skill set that the five of us don't have. Mike is an attorney, and a patent attorney at that, right? So we can lean on him heavily. We won't incur outside legal expenses either. Like we would, right, without having an attorney involved. Then I think what we're missing. We don't have anyone in finance. Like we don't have anyone that in our background that was a chief financial officer or anything like that. Maybe Stacy could cover that, and maybe not. Stacy, I'm sorry, Jessica. Because she. I know she's on some financial advisory committees. But I didn't get the sense that she was like a CFO or accountant type person.

### You (2025-08-21T13:24:52.866Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:24:54.946Z)

So we're missing that. That's a big hole that we're missing.

### You (2025-08-21T13:24:59.906Z)

We just need a higher. Or just pay a CPA for the time being. I mean, who's just. We gotta. Somebody's got to keep the books, right?

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:25:13.106Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-21T13:25:14.146Z)

Yeah, when we talk about getting reimbursed for some of the expenses that we're all incurring right now, and, I mean, somebody's got to keep track of that. If Mike can handle actually setting up some of these things that we need from a legal standpoint, paperwork, that might be all we need right now. At least maybe to the end of the year. So I think we have a little bit of leeway. Do we actually need a cfo?

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:25:40.546Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-21T13:25:46.946Z)

Now, or do we wait until we actually have revenue coming in and then get a cfo?

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:25:53.106Z)

The latter, right? Yeah. I mean, because. Just because we're so already stacked with senior people, and if the revenue that's going to come in, we're kind of looking at it in these chunks. It's not like 100 clients. A couple of clients that would be writing $100,000 from a right perspective.

### You (2025-08-21T13:26:13.346Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:26:16.706Z)

So. Okay. And then how do you think Mark, Drew and Vinod will. How would you think that they'll think about this? Positively worried about control like.

### You (2025-08-21T13:26:30.626Z)

No, I think there'll be fine with it. Vinod. I don't think he even has any experience in something like this. I certainly want to give him a voice, but I just feel that he would just defer that type of decision to everybody else, and he would just support the decision. Drew, I think, would probably be very supportive because I know he's had difficulties getting his business off the ground, and maybe he didn't have. These types of resources. So I think maybe he would probably, based on his experience, want to bring somebody in like that as well.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:27:16.946Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-21T13:27:19.186Z)

And marc? I don't know. I'm pretty sure that he would be supportive. I don't see why not.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:27:26.626Z)

Okay. He'd probably rather have someone else write the check than himself, right? I mean, that's kind of. Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-08-21T13:27:31.986Z)

I would think he would want to get something like that. And, yeah, I know he's pushed back. On precede, but I think he pushed back on his group. Or his people somebody else's room when you come in today and write a check. I don't think he would turn them down.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:27:46.546Z)

The Florida angel investors. Right. Right. Right. And Mike went through the whole thing like the you do. And Drew has mentioned this, too. They're safe notes. They don't. They don't actually get shares until we go to series A funding, and that triggers then the. The. I don't know what you call it. The acceleration or the. The you. Know, the springing or whatever, you know, you would call it from a legal perspective.

### You (2025-08-21T13:28:13.186Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:28:15.106Z)

Okay, so what I'm going to do, we'll talk on the call tonight and I'll mention. I'm just going to mention. Mike, I'm not going to mention Carlos yet because I have no idea how tomorrow is going to go. Carlos could say, no way, Jose. Right. And I don't want to get over my skis on that.

### You (2025-08-21T13:28:35.266Z)

Yeah.

And then if you're okay, if I could just. I'm going to kind of phase this in. Set up a call with you and Mike and myself for next week, if that's okay. Just. And then we'll introduce them to everyone else. But let's take it, because, again, you and I are. Kind of like the, you know, the core of it right now, pulling it through. So start there.

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-21T13:28:57.346Z)

All right.
