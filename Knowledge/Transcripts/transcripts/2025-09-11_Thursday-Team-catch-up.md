# Transcript for: Thursday Team catch-up

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:15:16.648Z)

Good. We saw what we needed to see. I Benude was. What do you even call it? When you team someone, you chat, right? That he thought we could create the same functionality. And that's fine. I really just wanted to show it to you guys. Right. Because. Fresh and modern. Right. Goodness. I would like to try to get true to your point that brokers could use this. I mean, this is a way we could maybe escalate or accelerate is the word I'm looking for. Trying. To be a transaction platform, right, is by having better interactions like something like this, especially for. Because dispositions is really hard on a management company. It takes a lot of resources and you'll be touring a hotel and you don't have a double available or something along those lines. And so this actually could be a really great way for our industry to transition to better sales tactics. Yeah. Before you go there quickly, I had a few lines here. We can definitely develop that in house. I don't think there was anything complicated there. It looked fresh because they have done a lot of good work on the ux. The images were good, color combinations were good. And this is very much doable in house, for sure.

### You (2025-09-11T22:16:43.129Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:16:43.928Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T22:16:44.729Z)

Good point.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:16:47.368Z)

Well, then, can we, though? Like, now we've all seen it, right? And so we've seen what it's like. So this is something I would love to have on our roadmap. Not in the first six months, but I think it would be great to have it within the first year if we can. Yeah, I think that.

### You (2025-09-11T22:17:04.969Z)

That's a stretch. It's a stretch goal, but we can look for it.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:17:09.528Z)

Ideas like our ideas Bucket. Right. That can be on there.

### You (2025-09-11T22:17:14.089Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:17:14.568Z)

And totally makes sense, but. Yeah, I agree. This is, like, getting so far ahead of what we need to be focused on. It's just like, again, like, I wasn't rude. I just wanted to. I didn't want us to lose the opportunity to come back. And talk about the key items that we really need to focus on to just. What would be great is to get a copy of his whatever. Just one copy for our reference. You can probably go from there. I can try. I'm not sure he will. I mean, he's not gonna, but I'll give it a shot. Yeah, but anyway, it is not something very difficult to connect. I think Howard. Howard can come up with. He literally just sent them and their company website. Okay, great. All right. Since we only have a few minutes. I'll run through this. And I wanted to try to spend the bulk of the remaining minutes to talk about product. Howard and benod your sections. So on the llc. Diane and I spoke about that today. There's some adjustments I'm going to make, and then we're going to review with Mike Sherbin, given that he's an attorney, also my attorney. And then hopefully that will be finalized next week. I'll send it around to all of you to review as well. Before we do that, And then we can open up the bank account. And get a card, link to it and all that. Similarly. I requested a safe note, like a market standard market safe note template from my attorney. Which he just provided. So I'm going to review that, and that will give us. Some basic format that we can use as we start to look at getting fake notes. And just to be very clear, I feel that we had different conversations or I've had conversations with each of you. Right. A safe note. It is really alone. Up front. Right. It is a loan that converts to equity or has the option to convert to equity at some point in the future based on if certain events happen. And the real appeal if you're an investor, getting a safe note is that you get some either you call it a discount or you get an added bonus, like If I give $1,000. I get at the point the note converts, you get a bonus. Right? Like if you convert the note, rather than getting $1,000 of equity, you get $1,200 or $2,500, right? So you get a 20, some percentage bonus. On top of what you invested at the valuation that happens at that moment. That's kind of incentive from an investor perspective. But otherwise.

### You (2025-09-11T22:20:23.049Z)

Hey, Drew, can you zoom in just a little bit, maybe to 120 or so? There we go. I'm just on my laptop screaming today. So thank you.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:20:37.048Z)

So I just wanted to cover that. Do you have any questions about Safe Notes other than that? Diane, you're going to get the budget to meet. And again, whatever you have doesn't matter. Month by month. Whatever tomorrow. Get me what you have and I'll work with that from there. That. Really? On the finance side, the pitch deck. I am going to work on that after this. And have something again, consolidating with Dan, like everything that you've done, a lot of great points, content everything in the deck that you have and the points that Mark has laid out. And I'm going to lend those and put it through this pop AI thing that hopefully will do it because last time create some really amazing professional looking, basically format and pictures and colors and all that. We can discuss. Hopefully be able to present next week.

### You (2025-09-11T22:21:46.329Z)

Hey, drew. Can we scroll back up a little bit? Right below. You've got the one pager. Had a good call yesterday. I introduced Mark to Carrie, and this is something that we specifically discussed with her about getting something ready for the Phoenix conference. Would you mind letting her help with the one pager portion, or did you have something very specific that you wanted to do?

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:22:13.368Z)

I was going to try to get an AI program to do it. But I've been unable to get one to do what I am trying what I want. That might be. Yeah, that might be, like, an interesting something to have or work on. I would be reluctant for us to pay for anything. At all right now. That is not product focused, because that is absolutely the priority. So maybe that's something we can revisit in a couple of weeks. I mean, do you have any idea what she would charge for something like that?

### You (2025-09-11T22:22:54.089Z)

Yeah. We've agreed to $30 an hour, capping it anywhere between five and 10 hours. Based on what we need to do. Something like that might take. An hour and a half or two hours. So we're talking 50, $60 to get something like that put together.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:23:15.208Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-11T22:23:18.169Z)

And just FYI.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:23:22.648Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-11T22:23:32.729Z)

She's working on the logo. And larc. I don't remember. Did we? Didn't really decide on anything else other than the one pager, did we?

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:23:43.848Z)

Yeah, that was. Do you guys hear him? I continue. Mark, you broke up a little bit. We really focused on the one pager in terms of immediate step.

### You (2025-09-11T22:24:03.449Z)

Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:24:05.208Z)

Okay? Well, that's not. Yes, that's very affordable. Diane drew up something the other day that I thought was really good. Diane, I downloaded that drawing you sent to Marking me the other day. So we go back to that. And send that around. And maybe some of the things that I got AI to do, but which I didn't really like. Because this is all still. It's not totally. It's in my head, but I don't even know what that would look like. But I have a rough idea that. So maybe if I can flush it out enough that. Makes sense for Carrie to work on it. That might be doable. So let me work on that next. Guys, I have to leave in five, six minutes. I could probably go first. Yeah. That actually is. I think that's all we have on this piece. Again. Still working on the format for product technology part of the conversation. But I think what I'll do is we'll just review this together. Howard, Vinod, you guys together? And just touch on these points. Staffing. How is the team doing? Are you coordinating with them? Any changes, et cetera? Talk with Howard about the documentation and various aspects. Some of this? Most. This is Howard Benoit. You sent me the diagram. I got to review this. And then I would like, to the extent possible, talk about. The, broadly speaking, the components of the MVP that are being worked on and what is the progress on each of them? First off, make sure we agree on what they are. What is the progress on all of them? When are they going to be completed? Are there any issues? Is there anything to show or test? What they are is already agreed upon. Mvp. I know, I know. For all of our sakes. I mean, I don't think we're talking, like talking about what they are right now. I don't mean going into a deep product call. I just spent more of the right things to be talking about. Next week? Because I know you said you have to go in five minutes. But next week, I'd like to try to talk a little bit more about each of. Like, just go through each of these and the note. And, Howard, tell us what's going on with what you're working on in these various components and what's the status?

### You (2025-09-11T22:26:44.889Z)

Yeah, just a progress update.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:26:44.968Z)

And the progress. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And I think we should go beyond this sheet as well. If anyone else want to talk about something else, not just this sheet. Yeah, we can talk about. We can add anything. This is just meant to, like, make sure we don't forget things or miss things that we have. But we can totally talk about other things. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, we should leave time for that. If we don't leave time, then we cannot really talk because we spend. Most of the time on this seat. Yeah. Are there other things, you know, do you want to talk about right now? Right now. I just quickly wanted to show you guys some of the progress we have made. I have also talked to Howard about some of the things. I think Howard is not really doing well. So I'll just quickly show you some of the things that, you know, we did in last couple of days. So one is we worked on Investment Summary. So that is here. Now, the only part is the extraction, which is kind of a bit challenging, and we have been constantly trying to improve that. We still need to do some work on ux, but. Kind of what you call this is more than a boilerplate. This is already synced with the database, database values and all. Whenever we update, I'll just show up on this page. And then we also have the evaluation. This also needs some UX work to be done, but yeah. It's like synced with database and that's how you don't see the values here. That. And then we are trying to kind of run our service on the stage environment right now for the summary. Hopefully that will be up and you guys should be able to see.

### You (2025-09-11T22:28:43.209Z)

So yeah. Vinod, can you give us an update on the data extraction? Has there been any progress since we talked about it last week?

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:28:52.488Z)

Yes, we have made some progress on that, and we kind of trying to improve that. So progress is basically. I'll tell you how we started. We started on the more Microsoft model called Layout lm. We trained that extracted, but the accuracy was not there. Then we tried another one called Table Transformer, which is also of Microsoft, which is considered better than layout. Version one. Version one was what we are trying. We were trying because version 2 and 3 were not MIT license. That is kind of. We need to do some more work on that. We need to train it, and probably that's going to take a little time. But now we kind of using something called intelligent document processing, which is part of our bedrock infrastructure. And. I'm much more confident on that one. This. We're trying to, you know, run that service up, hopefully. That should be our. Probably, you know, the service that we will end up with, at least for now. Yeah, we did try ocr as well. Ocr is always not great. Any ocr technology right now. You need a lot of fallbacks and multiple services and they don't work on any uninstructured data there. You need to set up lot of rule based formulas which are not great. We had the similar problem with Rediq. You know, we had like 16 people team in Hyderabad, I believe, who are just processing the failing rent rolls for Rediq, so, yeah, we don't want to use that. But, I mean, you guys feel free to go on Dev and stage and, you know, check what's the progress whenever you get time.

### You (2025-09-11T22:31:01.849Z)

The note before you drop. Let me update everybody on the prd. Drew, you had a notation of on your list there for the formula. Prd. It's not complete. That's something I've been working on. So I took all. Drew, I took all of your notes, incorporated them into the document. But as I'M. Going through row by row, I'm actually finding things that are missing. Well, they're actually not missing. So in the prd for each component. In the avm. Right. So you've got the metric cards at the top of the screen. And the metric table. That's what we have in the formula prd. But down below, for all the individual occupancy, revenue and expense, The formulas for those items are in the PRDs that are related to that section of the ABM. So I want to consolidate everything. So anything having to do with a formula. Will be included in the formula prd. So some of those will be in both, right? And those are the simple ones. It's like some. This column. Or revenue minus expenses. Right. So it's not going to take that long, but I do need to get that. Into that prd. I'll be working on that all day tomorrow. And maybe a little bit over the weekend. Along with having screenshots for each item so the developers can see what part of the model is being referenced in there, right?

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:32:48.328Z)

Amazing. Thank you. They're very. We can get them all in one place. And then we were also talking to have, you know, probably weekly call with developers or twice, you know, twice a week with Howard to kind of, you know, help us understand the formula, as you know that better.

### You (2025-09-11T22:32:58.169Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:33:05.928Z)

Yeah, and I. I know I need to review the AI PRD that you sent over, so that's on my to do list. And then the database diagram. Yeah. Database diagram is really continuously changing. True. But yeah, you can still have look. Yeah, I mean, you send me that, you know, if there's material changes, you know, you can send me a more recent one. Sure. Yeah. Okay? Otherwise. I mean, there was the lar. I mean, Howard, we talked about LARC last week. Are you gonna create? Is that gonna go into a. Create a PRD for that as well, or.

### You (2025-09-11T22:33:44.889Z)

We'll need to determine where we would show that data. The visibility within the model is going to have to be a setting at the account level. So we need to know that this account is a subscriber to LARC and only make sure that they are the only ones that can view it. So there are going to be some technical requirements. Not going to be difficult, but it is going to require prd.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:34:12.648Z)

Yeah, okay. All right. If we could go over that. Sometimes. See, I'm available on Fridays, most of the times, and then weekends. So if possible, we can, you know, go over that on these days, that would be great. Or after five, any. Yeah. It's. We don't. I mean, that's not as urgent. I know the other. We can do it tomorrow, but we could also do, like, next Friday or the Friday after, maybe. That sounds good. So you're not. You can focus on the things you need to focus on. Sounds good. Sounds good. All right, guys, I have to leave now. But all right. Have a good night.

### You (2025-09-11T22:34:52.169Z)

See?

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:34:52.728Z)

All right. Okay? I mean, anything else. Again, like next week. Hopefully we can have the whole hour so we can go through. All this. And, yeah, discuss a little bit more thoroughly. And now, you know, maybe I'll send you this list of like product technology. But it's, you know, what I was hoping you and Vinod could speak to would be, you know, infrastructure data, model development, the pipeline feature, document scraping, deal details, pvm, AI features, reports, something along those lines and just speak to each piece. Okay? All right.

### You (2025-09-11T22:35:34.489Z)

Anything else.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:35:34.568Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-11T22:35:37.689Z)

All right. See everybody.

### Guest (2025-09-11T22:35:39.768Z)

Guys. Bye. Thanks, everybody.

### You (2025-09-11T22:35:40.889Z)

Yes. Take care.
