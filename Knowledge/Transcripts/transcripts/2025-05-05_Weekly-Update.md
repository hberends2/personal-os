### You (2025-05-05T17:33:39.290Z)

the the way that the naming structure will be

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:33:40.873Z)

progress on going through the the way the

### You (2025-05-05T17:33:44.390Z)

will be developed.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:33:44.683Z)

the naming structure will be

### You (2025-05-05T17:33:46.930Z)

And and and so we talked about

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:33:47.523Z)

will be developed,

### You (2025-05-05T17:33:49.380Z)

potentially having a first pass at the proof of concept

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:33:50.093Z)

And and so we talked about potentially having a first pass at the proof of concept maybe within, like, a week or ten days, something like that.

### You (2025-05-05T17:33:53.120Z)

maybe within, like, a week or ten days, something like that. Howard, still thinking that's reasonable at this point.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:33:59.343Z)

Howard, are you still thinking that's reasonable at this point?

### You (2025-05-05T17:34:00.300Z)

That's a that's a veneer call. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:34:03.463Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T17:34:05.600Z)

I I think we'll have at least portions of it, but Okay. Yeah. I do need to circulate

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:34:12.733Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T17:34:14.020Z)

one more or a couple more questions based on some of the information. Now I don't know if everybody's had a chance to get in and put down the order of the items in that

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:34:26.033Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T17:34:28.090Z)

spreadsheet. If not, it'll probably take you five minutes. It's it's not gonna be taking too long. But there is one other item that I was gonna send up, I think I can just do that via email. I don't think it's something that anybody needs to log in to see anything. So I'll I'll get that out today. And Okay. Once we have that, that'll be

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:34:49.743Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-05T17:34:52.610Z)

very helpful to put together the modals and knowing which process we go through. But, yeah, I don't know what Vinod's availability or what what type of bandwidth he's got, so I don't know how far. Can get in a week or so, but Okay. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:35:16.983Z)

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:36:48.493Z)

you've seen the the what that data looks like That's is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:36:53.260Z)

for us to start reviewing the work you've done because there's a prob there's probably a lot of things

### You (2025-05-05T17:38:05.640Z)

short. Right? Because of the attention span of investors, potential clients. But

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:38:07.473Z)

that we can take from that. And, obviously, it needs to be shortened, right, because of the attention span of

I don't think they wanna read through 56 pages, but

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:38:14.203Z)

and potential clients. But

really top of mind to you, and that is Howard it together in Trello, which is

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:38:58.443Z)

I do want one go back because I know it's that's really top of mind to you. And that is Howard put it together in

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:03.320Z)

part of the software package that we're using. But kind of the beginning of a product

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:06.313Z)

Trello, which is part of the software package that we're using.

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:08.580Z)

road map, I know this something that's been very top of mind for you. Like,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:11.563Z)

Kind of the beginning of a product road map. And I know this is something that's been very

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:12.410Z)

what features are in the proof of concept, what features are, you know, the next

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:16.443Z)

top of mind for you, like, what features are in the proof of concept,

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:18.070Z)

we're gonna look at, what features are future to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:20.693Z)

what features are, you know, the next things we're gonna look at, what few

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:21.820Z)

you know, possibly be considered Now that's the way you broke it out. Right? It's kind of

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:25.183Z)

features are future to

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:27.120Z)

simplistically three buckets at this point. Like, what is we're right. What's

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:27.333Z)

you know, possibly be considered. Howard, that's the way you broke it out. Right? It's kind of simplistically three buckets.

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:31.420Z)

in the proof of concept? What's to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:33.733Z)

At this point. Like, what is right. What's it in the proof of concept, what's

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:33.760Z)

what actually, not if I remember now. You broke down that there is place of Trello where anyone

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:38.673Z)

to what no. Actually, no. If I remember now, you broke it down that there is a place in Trello

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:39.560Z)

can add anything that they want to be considered at any time. Right? It's almost like a brain dump.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:43.893Z)

where anyone can add any feature that they want to be considered at any time.

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:45.740Z)

And then they're Trello

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:48.473Z)

Right? It's almost like a brain dump. And then there is a

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:49.360Z)

card which says, okay. These are the then the things we're gonna prioritize next.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:53.403Z)

Trello card, which basically says, okay. These are the then the things we're gonna prioritize

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:55.030Z)

Which may be after proof of concept, but part of the MVP.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:39:59.463Z)

next, which may be after

### You (2025-05-05T17:39:59.960Z)

Is is that how you would describe it? Yeah. In fact, I can go ahead and bring it up here. We can take a look at it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:40:02.263Z)

proof of concept, but part of the MVP. Is is that how you would describe it? That'd be great.

### You (2025-05-05T17:40:07.800Z)

Let me rearrange my screen so we can see it. Alright. Need to put you guys up on top in one and north on the bottom there. Alright. So you should see our invest team site. Does everybody see that? Okay. So once you begin to the invest teams, over here,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:40:38.203Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-05T17:40:39.170Z)

on the top, there's a few things that we need to be aware of. First, obviously, we got the posts and everything, but under the files tab, is where we're running a lot of the documents. You know, if you go under the valuation model tab, there's all the documents that Diane sent out a long time ago. Some of Drew's models. But what Diane is referring to is here. This tab here, just labeled Invest AI, is a Trello board. That's imported into here. So, what we're talking about here is what we call the, just the ideal list. Parking lot. Anything goes. Whatever idea you have, no matter how big, how small, you can come in here. All you have to do is click on add card, Down here you can see enter the idea. And then now you've got a card here. But then if you click on it, this is where you can enter, you know, you know, enter the details. Of what it is that you think we should add. You know, everything that you can think of, you know, when I try to put these together, I try to think that I'm trying to communicate this to somebody who doesn't know what our product is. Right? Or or what our job is to to do. So the more detail, the better. Just click on save. And that's all you need to do. So the next step is as a team, we would all get on this call and we would start looking at these. And we'd say, okay, you know, the next step then is to break it up into these three buckets. You know, now, next, later. Or the fourth bucket, will not do. Okay? So as a team, we will sit there and we'll talk about, you know, the benefit, the value, the how how difficult is it going to be, etc. And based on that, we'll put it into the now, next or later. And the way that this typically is that now, pretty self explanatory, this is what Vinod would probably be working on coding And it doesn't have to be engineering or product. This could be marketing, sales, customer service. I mean, anything associated with the product. Right? And so ideally, when he's done, with the now, we put that over and then whatever's in the next can then be moved over here because you know, now we've got that space open up. And so, you know, we can just drag it from one group to the other. Very, very simple thing to do. So this works pretty well when you're dealing with a small team. And just getting started. You know, I think a year or two from now, this is outgrow this. But for the time being, this is probably the easiest way to to put together a road map. Now this doesn't visualize it in a Gantt chart. But it but it can be. There's there's more information here in these cards. We could input timeline. We could take a look at it. Know, in a timeline view. But since there is no timeline associated with this right now, they're all in the same there. But you can just jump back and forth. Depending on your personal preferences as well. On the in the proof of concept and and I think you're well. Remember that proof of concept is something. So someone said this recently, recently to to Mark and to me that if a couple of years now, we don't look back at our proof of concept and be absolutely humiliated by how simple it is. And we probably feel like

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:16.643Z)

And so some of the things that we've been talking about

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:17.100Z)

done we've probably done too much. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:20.053Z)

well, in the in the proof of concept, and and I think

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:20.510Z)

keeping in mind the proof of concept is is just intended to be that I'm very, very sympathy. And between the proof

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:23.173Z)

we all need to remember that the proof of concept is something. Someone said this recently

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:26.650Z)

of concept and then the MVP is where

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:27.573Z)

to to Mark and to me that if a couple of years from now, we don't look back at our

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:29.030Z)

we'll be having things like good marketing versioning and

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:32.273Z)

proof of concept and be absolutely humiliated by how

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:32.900Z)

version control and being able to track changes. Right? It's something that's really important to you.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:35.353Z)

simple it is, then we've probably not done we've probably done too much.

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:38.860Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:39.933Z)

Right? So keeping in mind the proof of concept is

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:42.730Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:42.953Z)

is just intended to be that, very, very simplistic.

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:43.200Z)

Many times. I Uh-huh. I I I I think the thing we need to keep in mind

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:46.963Z)

And between the proof of concept and then the MVP is where I think we'll be adding things

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:48.040Z)

is that acquisitions people are very busy.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:51.663Z)

like good marketing over versioning and

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:52.400Z)

And we're asking them to change

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:54.593Z)

version control and being able to

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:54.910Z)

the software they use. To help us.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:44:56.983Z)

track changes, right, is something that's really important to you.

### You (2025-05-05T17:44:57.330Z)

And they have to believe it's gonna help them.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:00.573Z)

Well, again, I I just if I could just jump in because you you quoted that expression many times.

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:01.150Z)

Put that to take us seriously. So we're I think that

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:05.543Z)

And I Uh-huh.

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:05.660Z)

the first version is not gonna be perfect and that we will go look back at the

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:06.703Z)

I I I think the thing we need to keep in mind is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:10.200Z)

and then glad that it

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:10.903Z)

acquisitions people are very busy. And we're asking them to change the software they use to help us. And they have to believe it's gonna help them for them to take us seriously. So while I think that the first version is not gonna be perfect, and then we will go look back at it in years and and

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:14.010Z)

is allowed you know, people who are to disrupt their lives to help us Let's just help you to make their lives easier. They're I think they're gonna do it. So it's a little bit of a you know, double edged sword. Right? We know develop. I know it's working really hard to get a first product out the door.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:32.323Z)

laugh at it. Unless version one is allowing

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:34.940Z)

But if it doesn't do some things,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:37.553Z)

the people who are asking to disrupt their lives to help us

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:38.340Z)

that are making the user life easier, they're not going to use

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:40.813Z)

unless it's helping them make their lives easier,

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:41.760Z)

And and so we have people who are using it,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:42.863Z)

they're I don't think they're gonna do it.

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:44.700Z)

and say they like it,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:45.353Z)

So it's a little bit of a

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:46.680Z)

and saying that they would. Potentially

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:49.013Z)

you know, double edged sword.

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:49.080Z)

pay for it it's gonna be very

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:51.103Z)

Right? We we don't wanna over develop. I know everyone's working really hard to get a a first product

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:51.590Z)

hard. To rate. Anybody at a the current environment. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:55.743Z)

out the door.

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:55.780Z)

I just wanna

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:56.663Z)

But

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:56.800Z)

remind us that

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:57.593Z)

if it doesn't do some things

### You (2025-05-05T17:45:57.810Z)

it's just it it is, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:45:59.993Z)

that are making the user's life easier, they're they're not going to use it.

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:01.280Z)

that that's the way. I believe.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:03.523Z)

And

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:03.740Z)

This is gonna you know, progress

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:04.663Z)

we have people who are using it,

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:06.380Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:06.953Z)

and saying they like it,

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:07.020Z)

we find someone to give us some of that

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:08.883Z)

saying that they would

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:08.910Z)

money. Eventually.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:10.103Z)

potentially pay for it

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:10.230Z)

Without going through that process.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:11.673Z)

it's gonna be very hard to raise any money at all in the current environment.

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:13.000Z)

The they're investment is be so diluted.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:15.923Z)

So I just wanna remind us that

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:16.010Z)

To our equity.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:19.543Z)

it just

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:20.090Z)

Be you know, put more.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:21.083Z)

there's no

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:21.640Z)

Hard than they're doing.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:23.163Z)

that's the way

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:24.560Z)

Before.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:24.603Z)

I believe this is gonna

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:25.500Z)

Startups.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:26.303Z)

you know, progress. And you know, if if we find someone to give us some amount of money initially,

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:29.380Z)

But know, I've done sort of just trying to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:31.933Z)

without going through that process,

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:32.000Z)

to share the experience that I have

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:34.783Z)

they're they're

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:35.080Z)

and negative. Which there's a lot

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:35.803Z)

investment is gonna be so dilutive to our equity

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:37.400Z)

of both.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:39.113Z)

over time

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:40.230Z)

People that are

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:40.363Z)

that it may end up being you know, cause more harm than than good. And I've

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:41.050Z)

willing to give us a couple of

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:44.973Z)

I've been down this road before with other start ups,

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:45.190Z)

And so that ultimately

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:48.233Z)

I say this was I know we all have a lot of different experiences, but

### You (2025-05-05T17:46:48.260Z)

I think gonna have to be the most expensive money probably.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:46:51.693Z)

I've been down this road before, and I'm just trying to to share the experiences that I had both positive and negative, which there's a lot of both. Again, there's gonna be lots of people that that are willing to give us a couple hundred thousand dollars to start, but they're gonna take so much of the company

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:04.430Z)

But we're not doing that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:06.923Z)

and be so involved that, ultimately,

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:08.530Z)

That. Doing you know, $2

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:10.043Z)

I think it's gonna end up being the most expensive money we'd probably ever take. Mhmm. Is the trade yeah. It's a big trade off. I I totally agree. I've had that experience people are like, really like what you're doing. You know, we'll we'll pay we'd like to invest in it.

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:24.490Z)

pressures, you know, or financial

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:26.163Z)

But we're not doing the

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:26.800Z)

etcetera.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:27.373Z)

less than it's slightly different than what you're saying, but we're not doing the best less than

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:27.670Z)

Discounted those. But like, this is a natural process that has to happen

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:31.153Z)

you know, $2,000,000 and your company is only worth a million.

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:33.120Z)

and they weren't today. It's unfortunate not great.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:34.633Z)

It's only worth 2,000,000. So we'll stick the whole thing.

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:36.610Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:37.103Z)

It's all or nothing. Yeah. I mean, that's that's there there there

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:37.590Z)

so, anyway, I just wanna just stand up because it's

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:41.023Z)

are sharks out there, and and that those are gonna unless we do this

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:41.080Z)

it's what I've experienced in the past. So what we need to do

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:44.083Z)

kinda and, again, I know everyone has different pressures, you know, work, financial, etcetera. I'm not discounting those.

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:49.610Z)

spot. What features they

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:50.623Z)

But like, there's a natural process that has to happen, and and the environment today

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:51.810Z)

be included in the product to make it how you describe the market like that to to have people change the way they

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:56.273Z)

is is unfortunately not great. And

### You (2025-05-05T17:47:58.880Z)

can think. Or to make it attractive to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:47:59.573Z)

so, anyway, I I just wanna just add that because it's

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:02.810Z)

our buyers. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:02.883Z)

it's what I've experienced in the past.

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:05.080Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:05.093Z)

So then I I think what we need to do is make sure

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:05.860Z)

what important thing is is us all to go into that Trello board or into our team site.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:08.323Z)

sure because we all may have different views on what features need to be included in the product.

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:12.160Z)

Make sure that we start it or something

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:15.153Z)

To make it

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:15.810Z)

those lines.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:16.053Z)

what however you described it, Mark, like, to to

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:16.450Z)

But they can't features. That we think

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:19.133Z)

have people change the way they do things or to make it attractive

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:19.500Z)

are critical because it may impact our time

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:23.143Z)

to our

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:23.260Z)

frame. In which we decide to take this out to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:24.553Z)

our buyers. So

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:26.190Z)

investors. Right? Like, to me, it's

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:27.033Z)

I think one important thing is maybe for us all to go into that

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:28.400Z)

it's the data flow. Like, I mean, that's what I wanna get at is that

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:30.933Z)

Trello board or into our team site

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:33.460Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:33.823Z)

make sure that we maybe we star it or something along those lines. But

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:37.230Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:38.493Z)

the handful of features that we think

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:40.720Z)

you feel like

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:41.183Z)

are critical.

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:41.640Z)

it's

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:42.713Z)

It may impact our time frame in which we decide to take this out

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:44.420Z)

an acquisition file. And

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:47.353Z)

to investors. Right? Like, to me, it's it's the data flow. Like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:48.080Z)

my only on this is that like, we talked with

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:51.913Z)

I I mean, I that's what I wanna get at is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:52.580Z)

couple of weeks ago, is that as long as the one is

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:55.163Z)

you know, you don't have the key data anymore, and we're really working towards

### You (2025-05-05T17:48:56.940Z)

what they I'll just call it, you know, you know, a copy software. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:48:59.053Z)

a solution on that. But, Mark, I know for you, you feel like it's versioning control. Right? And

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:00.770Z)

We can't keep track doing. And so

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:05.393Z)

sharing

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:05.520Z)

believe Howard said version control is not an issue at all once they're doing it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:06.273Z)

an acquisition file. And my only concern on this is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:09.720Z)

In. Our cloud based software. The challenge

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:11.983Z)

like, we we talked about this a couple of weeks ago is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:13.000Z)

becomes if they download the model, make changes on their

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:15.743Z)

as long as someone is underwriting

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:17.550Z)

computer, and then even upload it

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:18.763Z)

within, I'll just call it, in our in our our cloud based software, right,

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:20.090Z)

once it's out of our domain. We have now

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:22.503Z)

We can keep track of what they're doing. And so

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:23.060Z)

ability to relate. Track. The changes. So I think

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:27.223Z)

believe Howard said versioning control is not an issue at all once they're doing it in

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:28.140Z)

like, each of us are gonna have to put the item that we think are really critical, and then we're gonna have to sit down and say, okay.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:32.103Z)

our cloud based software. The challenge becomes if they download

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:35.180Z)

Are these items actually achievable

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:36.603Z)

the model, make changes on their computer,

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:38.110Z)

And what we're trying to accomplish as we move from

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:40.073Z)

and then even upload it once it's out of our domain

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:42.690Z)

Excel based Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:43.763Z)

we have no ability to really track

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:44.470Z)

Underwriting. I'll

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:46.973Z)

the changes. So I I think, like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:47.030Z)

try to cloud based underwriting. But that's that's not all it's not like a one week. It's a there are kind of steps we take.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:50.023Z)

each one of us are gonna have to put the items that we think are really critical

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:53.360Z)

Over the Yeah. It's just just too much. Like you said before,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:54.273Z)

we're gonna have to sit down and say, okay. Are these

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:56.240Z)

Tanya. The first step here

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:57.653Z)

items actually achievable?

### You (2025-05-05T17:49:59.230Z)

my opinion,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:49:59.813Z)

In the in

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:00.040Z)

is that we have to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:01.153Z)

what we're trying to accomplish as we move from

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:01.540Z)

go to before investors. I just have a general

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:04.293Z)

Excel based, right, underwriting

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:05.880Z)

If if you say you're going to investors.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:07.603Z)

alt ultimately to cloud based underwriting. But that's that's not it's not like a one leap. It's a they're tiny steps we take.

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:13.300Z)

Of some

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:15.133Z)

Over the Right. It's just just two follow ups. You said before

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:15.530Z)

time. I don't know exactly what that time is. For people to use this thing

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:17.993Z)

I mean, the the first step here, in my opinion,

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:19.540Z)

It people acquisitions people.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:21.823Z)

is that we have to

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:21.950Z)

And and give us feedback and and and store.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:23.353Z)

go to users before we go to investors.

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:25.430Z)

See.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:25.723Z)

I I just I I know

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:26.110Z)

If they like it. Before we start talking to investors,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:27.733Z)

If if you said before we go to investors, I I don't know if you meant that or or or if that's

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:30.180Z)

because I the investors are gonna have any

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:31.843Z)

what we're thinking. But, like, I I think it has to be a period

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:32.520Z)

real kind of understanding of of how

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:35.183Z)

of some real amount of time. I don't know exactly what that time is.

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:38.360Z)

this is improving people's lives. Like, I think

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:39.233Z)

For people to use this thing

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:40.680Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:41.303Z)

It people being acquisitions people,

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:41.470Z)

feedback. Before we start.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:43.763Z)

and and give us feedback and and and start

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:43.950Z)

Raising money. That

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:47.203Z)

saying that they like it,

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:47.210Z)

and again, some of the issues I don't have

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:49.293Z)

before we start talking to investors.

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:49.600Z)

the technology knowledge that you all do.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:52.053Z)

Because I I don't think the investors are gonna have any real

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:52.100Z)

But you know, with acquisition, you know, it's always looking

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:54.733Z)

kind of

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:55.690Z)

to do an acquisition

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:50:55.833Z)

understanding of of how this is improving people's lives. Like, think we're gonna need some

### You (2025-05-05T17:50:59.240Z)

They really trust us with our kind plan

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:03.233Z)

feedback.

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:03.920Z)

if you will.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:03.983Z)

Before we start

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:04.800Z)

Or they don't wanna keep this out there.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:05.823Z)

raising money. The other thing is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:06.510Z)

Proprietary systems initially because we have the general purposes. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:09.023Z)

and, some of this is just I don't have

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:10.180Z)

Because you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:11.403Z)

the technology knowledge that you all do.

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:11.820Z)

if if we're we're helping someone to write something in a competitive

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:13.783Z)

But you know, will acquisition you know, when someone's look doing an acquisition,

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:15.720Z)

process, they may wanna have their own internal

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:18.223Z)

their work is very confidential and private.

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:18.840Z)

security. Because they may not

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:20.963Z)

You know, will they trust us

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:21.440Z)

know. How sites

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:23.063Z)

with our kind of

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:24.290Z)

protected. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:24.713Z)

web

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:25.280Z)

it's it's we we thought about it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:25.813Z)

you will, or are they gonna wanna keep this on their proprietary system?

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:26.680Z)

Like we'll submit a lot of trust us?

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:29.043Z)

Initially because for confidentiality purposes? Right? Because, you know, if if

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:30.940Z)

Or they don't it up there, sir. For the first you know, couple of months.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:33.943Z)

we're we're helping someone underwrite something in the competitive process,

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:34.880Z)

Until we get prove to them that their data is secure and not being shared with others.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:38.073Z)

They may wanna have their own

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:39.270Z)

Right? This is very confidential

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:39.963Z)

internal security. Because they may not know how our site is protected. So is it is that something we we thought about? Like like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:51:46.740Z)

Yeah. That

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:51:49.023Z)

someone day one trust us with their confidential stuff they're gonna wanna keep it on their server for the first, you know, couple of months until we can prove to them that their data is secure and not being shared with others. Right? Because this is very confidential I've only had one yeah, I've only had one group

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:05.890Z)

no.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:07.033Z)

It was Xenia. Say that they

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:09.900Z)

Trust us, but they one.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:10.953Z)

would not like, they they're like, we wouldn't we don't trust

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:14.370Z)

Depth of all. Systems.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:15.923Z)

anybody other than ourselves. So they're like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:16.470Z)

Yeah. Thank you. I think doubt and

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:19.443Z)

they asked for a demo. They saw our platform. They were like, looks really cool.

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:19.500Z)

I would if if I'm not able to

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:23.323Z)

I was like, what are you seeing? They're like, oh, no. We would never give our data to third parties. So

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:24.630Z)

fewer people with homeless.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:27.593Z)

no. Well, again, just to be clear, think initially, they'll

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:28.380Z)

Of reputation. And you guys have

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:31.633Z)

trust us. But day one, there may be some natural apprehension. Just because they don't really know the depth of our systems. Yeah. And I that's valid, and I would if if I had not been able to do what my company has done, with fewer people, with less a reputation than you guys have.

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:51.340Z)

it concern.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:52.443Z)

Right? I did it just myself.

### You (2025-05-05T17:52:52.860Z)

For

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:52:54.033Z)

With Starwood Capital, Sunstone, and a handful of others. And they certainly had concerns, but I was able to very easily say, you know, like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:01.340Z)

our

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:01.993Z)

we worked with we're a technology company. We know, I

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:02.330Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:05.193Z)

introduced them to our CTO and whatnot, and they they got pretty comfortable pretty quickly.

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:05.220Z)

you know, here's the security

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:09.403Z)

So I I it was not a it was not a huge that was not actually a

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:11.900Z)

your database.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:13.193Z)

a concern for I I hear like, I agree that that is something to think about, and I I think, like, it won't be

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:15.660Z)

Think we could call I think, I I I say, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:20.173Z)

an issue for us to say,

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:20.780Z)

80 next for the top is because

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:21.703Z)

it's gonna be, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:22.350Z)

put most of those

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:23.263Z)

on our, you know, cloud based servers. We have this level of security.

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:23.510Z)

concerns to stress, you know, Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:27.143Z)

You know, here's the security documentation.

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:27.590Z)

Great. Yeah. It it rarely comes up.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:29.533Z)

You know, we can speak to Howard Benno's background that they clearly know how to keep data

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:31.420Z)

The only thing that does come up is the data sharing part.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:33.573Z)

secure and work with databases. Via RedIQ and whatnot. So I think we can

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:35.910Z)

Where we would aggregate the data and use that for

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:37.463Z)

think we can put all those I think. I I I say, you know, 80, 90% confidence we can

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:39.830Z)

know, market information, market data. There are

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:44.123Z)

put most of those

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:44.810Z)

a couple of companies that we dealt with that just it's their policy. They don't

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:53:45.323Z)

concerns to to rest even on day one. Okay. Great.

### You (2025-05-05T17:53:49.430Z)

share the data. And and that's right. That that just means that they don't get access to those features. But, yeah. I mean, basically, has made valid points and there's good things. One thing that I really want to emphasize again is the difference between MVP and version one. MVP mark is really what what your

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:54:11.873Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T17:54:12.430Z)

talking about, which I a % agree. That's where we get a handful, maybe three to five potential clients or people that you know in the industry and ask them to take a look at it. And then take their feedback and say, okay. The you know, if they say I like this but I can't use it until you fill in the blank. That's what we then take that and make into version one. And and I don't think that we go to an investor or anybody else until we have something like that. Because you're absolutely right. You have to have You have to have some clients. You have to have happy clients. Somebody who's going to speak well. Before anybody's gonna cut a check. So, you know, the sooner we can get that MVP, the better. Just wanna about something at all. There has been suggested to me by in the pop text space And that that first folks to go to So we'll have the prescribers and the scope

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:55:21.613Z)

I I just wanna book just wanna jump in with one thing, though, that has been, suggested to me by some of my female colleagues in the in the PropTech space. And that is that

### You (2025-05-05T17:55:32.610Z)

not really

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:55:34.263Z)

when you are looking for initial investors family offices in your business may be, some of the first folks to go to. So, like, the Pritzker's and the

### You (2025-05-05T17:55:46.110Z)

as well.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:55:46.203Z)

and help me, maybe the Portmans and the Ubroff and maybe the Tishes, you know, people that

### You (2025-05-05T17:55:48.260Z)

So want keep that open to us. Because users could also be investors. Yes. Yes. That is that is a very good point. I mean, if you can get them

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:55:54.803Z)

Mark we know that, you know, may have

### You (2025-05-05T17:55:58.930Z)

to be

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:55:59.473Z)

may, in some part, be involved with hotel investing and maybe a user

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:00.000Z)

you know, the beta testers, you know, that would be huge. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:04.443Z)

and an investor at the same time. I would put I would put Carlos Rugerich junior in there as well.

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:04.970Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:10.173Z)

So I wanna keep that avenue open to us because users could also be investors.

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:17.450Z)

Platform I like it. So you know, the

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:26.023Z)

Yeah. And we didn't I I know our customers

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:26.470Z)

yeah. Even have

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:29.933Z)

again, Starwood Capital, Sunstone, Woodbine, Radco, I mean, Starwood Capital has a platform that they use

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:34.040Z)

to see what we have to offer.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:37.043Z)

for this kind of thing. Across all their asset classes.

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:39.860Z)

What So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:41.003Z)

And know that the hotel folks don't really like it,

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:45.400Z)

c h.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:46.073Z)

So, you know, this so even, you know, even if they have even though they have their own product that they use for this,

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:50.150Z)

It's Jerry attractive in where I once you get piled in all your data

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:53.493Z)

you know, it's they I think they would still be very interested to see what we have to offer and

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:54.350Z)

But can't do anything with it. In Cherry. Something on top of it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:56:57.953Z)

potentially have the hotel team use it.

### You (2025-05-05T17:56:59.380Z)

So they

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:00.083Z)

What what is that protocol, Drip? What are they use now?

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:02.970Z)

they which

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:03.303Z)

Starwood.

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:04.360Z)

is

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:04.413Z)

Uses a they have a data warehouse called Cherry. C h e r r e. Okay. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:10.190Z)

And so we built out

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:11.473Z)

Yeah. They're Cherry is just a data warehouse. What you it

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:12.160Z)

great you know, hope.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:15.163Z)

piles in all your data, but you can't do anything with it. In Cherry, so you have to put something on top of it So they, they use Anaplan which is from my understanding, like, very fancy online programmable Excel.

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:29.840Z)

Update the value

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:32.563Z)

And so they built out basically pull the data from Cherry,

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:36.580Z)

don't like it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:37.473Z)

and the Internet plan, build the drivers and all this stuff. Right? So

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:39.180Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:40.853Z)

every quarter, the rest of managers are going in there and and redoing, you know, up tooting

### You (2025-05-05T17:57:42.470Z)

I know that's still two things from Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:57:44.833Z)

updating the valuations based on the most recent forecast, actuals, budgets, and doing their projections for the next five years to to update the value of the portfolio. But again, I know that the asset managers across the different funds, like, to varying degrees don't like it. And and so it's again, that even that's an opportunity us. Then otherwise, I know Sunstone's using Excel

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:05.970Z)

We get all the different already with what's helping I have.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:07.043Z)

would buy you know, all the other ones are all just using Excel. Right? So and I I think as far as, like, initial, you know, getting some initial customers using this, Using our customers is a would be a really

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:19.340Z)

I just didn't put that they are a family office that, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:20.053Z)

like, very easy way. If they're like they like it, it'd be really easy for them

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:23.940Z)

could just somehow, you know, add family offices, but

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:24.513Z)

to sign up and and do this with their existing portfolio because, again, all the data's already with Hotel BIS. So be easy to push it into invest and have them do the quarterly evaluations. And then if they like it, they

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:32.460Z)

hey. This is from

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:35.773Z)

can do it for starting for new acquisitions as well.

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:37.770Z)

Yeah. Yep. Looks that way.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:38.873Z)

And Woodbine's the Scoville family. Yeah. Woodbine's You're right. I so just to put that they are a family office that

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:43.470Z)

Again, they're a customer. They you.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:45.553Z)

you know, if we could just somehow, you know, have family offices by

### You (2025-05-05T17:58:46.040Z)

Mhmm. Past.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:58:54.843Z)

I had to be lazy. I think she's frozen. But, yeah, she did ask me about the the Scoville family. They are they they again, they're a customer. They they do some investment not just hotels and other asset classes, but in technology. They've dabbled with various various, like, technology investments.

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:13.550Z)

Spread. Like you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:16.613Z)

In the past. So

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:17.270Z)

there's not value there.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:18.013Z)

could be something that they

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:19.070Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:19.743Z)

willing to do. And Starwood Capital also has, a venture capital arm that does

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:20.180Z)

So if you would, like, you know, you could deal with something that get whatever you want,

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:24.723Z)

specifically technology. That I've talked with a bunch of times. And I did run into Mark, exactly what you were saying, kind of that

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:31.520Z)

you.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:32.633Z)

that did ask

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:34.020Z)

You

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:34.493Z)

evaluation spread of, like,

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:36.810Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:37.213Z)

we wanna invest. We like what you're doing, but you're just there's not enough value there

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:37.630Z)

but I think we can take customers. I think, like, product provide what we're talking

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:41.373Z)

You know?

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:42.490Z)

about

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:42.513Z)

Like, if you were, like, you know, a

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:42.890Z)

you know, it it doesn't

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:43.913Z)

Peter Thiel or something, then we'd give you whatever you wanted for a

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:44.950Z)

like

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:47.003Z)

valuation you proposed. But this is your first time doing this. So

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:47.370Z)

I think pretty quickly with what we're talking about.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:50.673Z)

so, you know, we're not gonna you know, we need to see we need to see hard numbers before we can

### You (2025-05-05T17:59:51.030Z)

Get some customers to to sign up.

### Guest (2025-05-05T17:59:54.743Z)

know, really make a qualitative or a quantitative analysis of investments. So I think we can get customers. I think, like, if the product

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:00.350Z)

Get investors.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:02.433Z)

provides what we're talking about, you know, it it

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:04.190Z)

It's that once you set Right? It's really hard to change.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:06.173Z)

doesn't need to be

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:07.360Z)

Yeah. So I

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:07.513Z)

like,

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:08.710Z)

think we can.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:08.823Z)

I think you can provide value pretty quickly with what we're talking about and

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:09.350Z)

Afford it, I don't wanna say, like, don't charge anything. For some weird time. So we go to investors and then make money and then come back

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:13.523Z)

get some customers to to sign up. Even if we do it in a non paid basis initially, and then just to show and then get investor I mean, my reluctance of doing of going to paid

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:23.100Z)

it's it's probably people, you know, for customers to say they

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:26.653Z)

is that once you set a price, it's really hard to change.

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:27.020Z)

can't roll. To pay. Then that's really right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:29.793Z)

So I don't if we can afford it, I'd almost say, like, don't charge anything for

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:33.570Z)

That they ask is, know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:35.063Z)

some period of time until we go to investors and then get money and then come back

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:36.430Z)

to? Your pricing discuss price for essentially this is right, so you can go down that

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:38.733Z)

build the more robust product and come back and say, here's the here's the real, you know, full price deck.

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:40.950Z)

So the path of of of you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:43.533Z)

Yeah. No. I just to be clear, I I mean, I think it's it's probably

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:43.920Z)

kind of discovery. And you know, I just wanna make sure that what we

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:46.733Z)

equally helpful for customers to say they'd be willing to pay

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:48.290Z)

took out of time we can capitalize

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:50.473Z)

than actually paying. Because that when we're meeting with investors,

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:51.970Z)

time to kind of roll this out. And have users using it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:54.513Z)

you know, one of the first questions that they ask is, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:55.240Z)

Before start asking for money.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:57.293Z)

what's the market's reaction? You know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:57.830Z)

Because again, it's just

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:00:59.473Z)

your pricing? Have you discussed this pricing with potential users? Right? So you go down that whole

### You (2025-05-05T18:00:59.850Z)

if we do the opposite money. Would I think we're Right.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:03.573Z)

sort of path of of of

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:04.770Z)

Position. Yeah. No. You're right. I think that is where

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:05.623Z)

you know, kind of user discovery.

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:07.300Z)

now. I think she was just speaking

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:08.073Z)

And, you know, I just wanna make sure that when we talk about timing and capital needs that we're allowing

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:09.550Z)

it. This out to other people. Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:13.413Z)

some amount of time to kind of roll this out and have users using it.

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:16.510Z)

I'm gonna

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:17.563Z)

Before we start asking for money because, again, it's just

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:19.910Z)

do something, share something else. Is is there any other subject you wanted to touch on? Or

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:22.293Z)

if we do it the opposite way, we're I think we're gonna

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:24.450Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:24.803Z)

end up in a in a challenging position. Yep. And and I think Diane's aware of that. I think she was just speaking more broadly about

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:27.780Z)

intend include? This? Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:31.883Z)

taking this out to other people.

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:32.610Z)

Vinod and I were working I I put together what they call a requirement.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:34.063Z)

Okay. Sounds good.

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:36.050Z)

Document, which is basically you know, working with the engineering team and trying to get down into the details. And what what I did is I put together

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:45.913Z)

So, do we have a list of kind of what we

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:48.420Z)

what the majority of the final product looks

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:01:50.373Z)

intend to include in this MVP or v one?

### You (2025-05-05T18:01:52.390Z)

like, and then we go through and eliminate I gave it to Vinod to review, but I'll go ahead and send out a copy to everybody so you can see what the MVP looks like. And as well as as the full document. There's a lot of stuff in there that wouldn't make sense to anybody other than Vinod, so maybe I'll just go ahead and remove some of the things to make it so it's readable. And so, yeah, can I can send that out? Would that be a Thank good starting point for the discussion. Thanks. K. Let me show you something else. Work in progress. But what I wanted to do is to start looking at user profile or what we call personas who are our clients.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:02:46.373Z)

Okay. Thank you.

### You (2025-05-05T18:02:46.980Z)

So go in here. There's basically four different clients.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:02:47.683Z)

Thanks.

### You (2025-05-05T18:02:50.420Z)

That we've got or maybe five. We've got the investors. We 've got the asset managers. We've got the lenders. And or appraisers. As well as the brokers. So, could be up to five. Yeah. I looped lenders and appraisers together in here. But, essentially, looking at the user profiles, And I'm gonna walk you through this on the first slide. The other slides, I don't need to go into the detail. But essentially, as an investor, I would go in there and I would create a new deal. When that deal is created, we would look to see, is this in the HVIS database? If yes, is going to automatically populate most of the inputs Not all, because it doesn't have everything. It would be kind of, as I noted down here, combination of HBIS user uploading documents or manually inputting the data. So there again, if they create a deal and it's not an HBA IS, then we would go through and, you know, we have our process where they would upload the documents. We would extract the data, parse it, put it into the model. Some of those things where the user may have to manually input certain things for the at least for the very beginning. And that all goes into the valuation model. And then once the users are working in the model, that data also then goes into the Invest AI aggregated database. So any questions on here? The reason I say that is because the next few slides don't so so you have three Mhmm. You. Is there perspective. No. So that that kinda goes back to your question about the safety. So if you think about how it's set up,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:04:57.603Z)

Well so I have a quick question. So

### You (2025-05-05T18:04:59.970Z)

our clients

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:05:01.983Z)

so

### You (2025-05-05T18:05:02.180Z)

would be

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:05:03.053Z)

if you have

### You (2025-05-05T18:05:03.640Z)

at the account level. Right? So if it's a

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:05:04.433Z)

three users, underwriting the same deal, right, they're all competing

### You (2025-05-05T18:05:08.520Z)

investor, it could be a single investor or it could be an investment team.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:05:10.273Z)

to buy a hotel. Is their information gonna be shared with other

### You (2025-05-05T18:05:14.050Z)

It could be an institutional.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:05:14.763Z)

prospective bidders?

### You (2025-05-05T18:05:16.450Z)

Right? Same thing with brokers, everybody else. But in our database, it's 100% segregated. So based on their account ID, they will only see deals in their account. And the same thing at the user level. Right? So we could all be in the same employee, under the Invest AI account, but I'll have my deal list Drew will have his. Mark, you'll have yours. Now, because we're all under the same account, it's much easier for us to share a deal. And I'll get to that here in a few minutes. But that's to to your concern about safety, Nobody outside of our account will ever have access to any of the deals that we're working on. Right? So I guess when you call the best aggregate database, Mhmm. So what's getting out of the All of the data. That our users put in there But this is for Invest AI. Right? So all of the information that's going in here, all of this data that's being upload, ends up in the aggregated database. And this is where we then can put together

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:06:29.743Z)

So but so I guess when you call it an invest aggregated database,

### You (2025-05-05T18:06:32.830Z)

market reports

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:06:34.023Z)

so what's getting aggregated?

### You (2025-05-05T18:06:35.010Z)

different things And not only is it aggregated, but it's going to be anonymized as well. Right? So when we put together these market reports, you're not sharing Mark's underwriting. We're taking Mark's and Drew's and mine and Diane whoever's working on these deals, and it all gets lumped together in there. So we know at the market level or at the property type, you know, hopefully, we can get all of that. And then we can start making comparisons for operations, underwriting, etcetera. So, Mark, down the road, once you left once we update that. Data. You know, you use it. For benchmarking purposes. Yes. Right? So if if somebody creates a deal for a property and you know, right now,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:33.263Z)

So, Mark, down the road, once you have once we have enough data, we would be able to share that data. Not share it, but

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:41.650Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:42.443Z)

you know, use use it for benchmarking purposes.

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:42.470Z)

all the aggregated

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:45.113Z)

Right? So

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:45.280Z)

data set. Right? So say, like, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:46.263Z)

if if somebody's

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:47.620Z)

we can see

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:47.833Z)

creates a new deal for a property in

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:48.690Z)

we can go that they

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:50.003Z)

you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:50.130Z)

that the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:50.983Z)

Cleveland, Ohio.

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:51.070Z)

similar

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:52.553Z)

Then right now, they're gonna go and they're gonna pull in

### You (2025-05-05T18:07:56.590Z)

you can change your back

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:07:56.683Z)

historical financial data or load it. They're gonna add FTR data and then market data that will get from the marker of the horizons or something. But in the future, you'd be able to add in and say, like, you know, our own aggregated dataset. Right? So say, like, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:08.540Z)

Right. Once we have scale.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:12.183Z)

we can see we we know that they that that the

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:14.600Z)

Expect

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:15.573Z)

similar hotels that you want your underwriting, right, like, in this market or or at this you have RevPAR of this

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:16.980Z)

think about how describe. This. Thing. As a

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:20.483Z)

or year over year change of that.

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:21.060Z)

And so that people think that they're

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:22.313Z)

Or cost per occupied group or whatever. Right? So just more more granularity. Things that we might

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:27.410Z)

client.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:27.673Z)

currently go get from STR or again, Hotel Horizons or whatever, we will be able to produce ourselves.

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:32.250Z)

Also you know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:33.093Z)

Once we have the scale.

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:33.170Z)

perspective on

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:34.223Z)

Right. No. I I get all that and how it helps us, but I I think as we develop talking points to talk to

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:34.300Z)

But right, that would information is not ideal. Benefit.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:39.213Z)

prospective users, we just have to think about how we describe this

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:40.860Z)

Process. Yeah. So I heard you answer answer

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:43.633Z)

database aggregator.

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:43.910Z)

was a good answer. But think about how we're gonna

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:45.653Z)

So that people don't think that if they're putting in a lot of information about the

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:48.800Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:49.223Z)

Boca Marriott and some other client of ours is also looking

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:50.550Z)

Yeah. So customer

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:53.293Z)

to buy the Boca Marriott that

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:54.720Z)

Yeah. No. No. That's that's that's very valid, and that's why, you know, we have to emphasize

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:08:55.083Z)

not benefiting from the information that you know, prospective buyer a, put in.

### You (2025-05-05T18:08:59.660Z)

emphasize the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:09:00.163Z)

Right? That that information is not aggregating to the benefit of user b, right,

### You (2025-05-05T18:09:01.650Z)

anonymization of the data as well. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:09:03.993Z)

it's it's a highly competitive

### You (2025-05-05T18:09:04.670Z)

you can't look at the data and say, oh, that's coming from the Marriott on

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:09:05.503Z)

process. So I I heard your answer. I thought it was answer, but I just think we need to think about how we're gonna

### You (2025-05-05T18:09:09.250Z)

Main Street. Right? You don't want to get it. But you can say, Of all this

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:09:10.683Z)

proactively describe it so that people don't get concerned. Anyway, I'm just sort of putting my

### You (2025-05-05T18:09:13.560Z)

region or this market or this property type,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:09:17.413Z)

customer head on to and reacting.

### You (2025-05-05T18:09:17.510Z)

in this area. Here is what the average is. Here's what the mean, median, etc. Go through there and give them the growth rates, etcetera. So yeah. So as I mentioned, the workflow for the following slides is pretty much the same. But keep an eye on the aggregated database. As we start moving through here to different data types, that database is going to keep growing and growing. And you can see the treasure chest on the icon or in the database there. This is where this is where we will be making the majority of our money. Would be in that data The subscription for using the model you know, will make a profit. But it's not gonna it's it's not where the money is. So as a lender or appraiser, the process would be the same because they're simply using our model to come up with evaluation. Asset manager same thing. Now they would be uploading their data on a quarterly update, etcetera. But every time somebody uses our model, that egg aggregated database grows and grows. The next slide is where we're also going to be making significant revenue opportunities, and that's with the brokers. And, again, keep in mind, this is not all version one. But this is where we want to go. So a broker, you can see the process is the same. They get in there. They create a deal. And they create a model. So they can use this tool to determine what they want to sell the deal for. This is what I think a a fair selling price is. And then we'll go out to market. But another thing that Vinod and I were have worked on in the past is we called it the marketplace, but the process here is the same. And this is where you're going to really hook some users. In this place, or in this process, the broker will create a deal. And they'll go through the whole process of coming up with the valuation. But what they're going to do is they're going to share that deal. With with clients. So you may have three clients that you work with that might be interested in this Marriott. Right? So you put the deal together You share these models But, again, they're three independent models. So what client one is doing, client two and client three do not have any access to their model. So, you know, maybe I need to, like, put a brick wall between these for the visualization. But what you're doing is you're basically doing 90% of the work on behalf of the client. When you go in and create a model. Now, it's no more work on the broker part They are going to create the model anyway. But now you are saying, hey, here is my model. Here are my assumptions. What do you think? And then these clients then will go through and say, yeah, this is good, but I want to add this or I want to change that. They then come up with their own valuation, and eventually, you know, hopefully, they'll be putting in an offer. And so this is this is a way that you can easily not only give it these models to existing clients, but this would be a good sales point, saying, hey, look. You know, if you used Invest AI, you can get all of this information for free And literally within thirty minutes or an hour, they could go through, tweak the assumptions, and come up with their own valuation, right, instead of weeks or months, you know, you could cut that time down very quickly. Acquisition know, that I thought about I think I discussed know, Right? We have this massive data. Dump.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:13:46.843Z)

See, I see, I had thought about it from a slightly different perspective. Is is version one gonna be geared just to the

### You (2025-05-05T18:13:47.450Z)

Right? Historicals have started for you know, property conditions. Reports and titles.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:13:53.553Z)

acquisition team, or are you envisioning

### You (2025-05-05T18:13:54.420Z)

Points. You know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:13:55.673Z)

sort of having the broker part be part of version one? Because

### You (2025-05-05T18:13:56.930Z)

equity. Analysis for prospective equity investors that you have

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:00.603Z)

know, one of the things that that

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:00.940Z)

done analysis when you one went longer.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:02.273Z)

I had thought about, and I I think I discussed it with Diane early on,

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:06.050Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:06.403Z)

You know, when you're looking at an acquisition,

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:06.510Z)

you know, if is there way where

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:08.803Z)

right, you have this massive data dump early on,

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:09.560Z)

what source prices couple of doubling.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:12.413Z)

Right? You have historicals. You have star reports. But then you also have things like

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:15.930Z)

Parts of the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:16.403Z)

you know, property conditions reports and title reports and

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:17.020Z)

model seamlessly to all these third parties. Right? So for example, if I'm

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:20.083Z)

you know, you have the you know, you have equity

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:21.360Z)

be a buy them, Boca, underwriting.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:22.613Z)

analysis for prospective equity investors, and you have a debt analysis when you wanna go to lenders. Right? And then you need to send information to the appraisers.

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:28.070Z)

I may wanna just set part

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:30.643Z)

And, you know, if is there a way

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:30.690Z)

this model. To six different banks.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:32.943Z)

where

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:33.360Z)

Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:34.473Z)

all this information is double uploaded for

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:35.390Z)

you know, And exact information,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:37.313Z)

know, investor ABC, he or she can disseminate

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:38.270Z)

give me initial charge fees. Right? That's something that's

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:40.803Z)

parts of the model seamlessly

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:41.680Z)

typically happens in the investment

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:43.033Z)

to all these third parties. Right? So for example, if I'm looking at buying the

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:44.000Z)

process. The way we're

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:46.703Z)

the Marriott and Boca, and I have my underwriting model

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:47.770Z)

file. Then set

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:49.923Z)

which is in Invest AI. Right? I may wanna just send part of this model to six different banks

### You (2025-05-05T18:14:56.360Z)

a certain part of our model to the lenders.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:14:58.403Z)

and have them you know, based on the same exact information, give me initial term sheets.

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:00.230Z)

Then I wanna send And part to narrow my can help them have that particularly

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:04.913Z)

Right? And that's something that typically happens in the investment underwriting process. And

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:07.420Z)

Yeah. Right? Right. Buy.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:09.583Z)

the way it works historically today is that you have to prepare a sub file

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:10.950Z)

Their own process. By using our software.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:13.053Z)

then send it to each lender, and you gotta make sure you're sending the same information to each lender.

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:14.860Z)

Mhmm. And they can simultaneously do.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:16.793Z)

But if there was a way

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:17.010Z)

Six different things.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:18.073Z)

you know, to to flawlessly just say, I wanna send a certain part of our model,

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:18.400Z)

To prepare some files of that's another thing that that is a huge topic suck.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:23.003Z)

to the lenders and then I wanna send per of our model to Marriott Hyatt Hilton and have them compete

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:23.340Z)

Industry just like cohort department distance firm, the appraisal firm,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:29.283Z)

to give me a proposal to franchise the deal.

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:30.170Z)

And it looks to all these sort of offshoot

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:32.393Z)

Right? And I can you know, the buyer or prospective buyer can create their own

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:32.910Z)

of the same day. That's originally done there. One,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:36.333Z)

marketing process

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:36.750Z)

That would make the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:37.703Z)

by using our software and they could simultaneously do six different things without having to prepare

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:39.690Z)

You know, that cut off hours. Their day. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's that's that's actually

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:43.823Z)

sub files. That that's another thing that that is a huge time suck.

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:45.030Z)

fairly basic functionality. What we would need to do, I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:47.473Z)

In the industry just like coordinating

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:49.460Z)

that's just basically

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:49.893Z)

the information. Right? And then you have to send information to the property conditions firm and the appraisal firm

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:50.600Z)

reporting. Right? So we've got all of that dead data over here

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:54.863Z)

And if those could all be sort of offshoots

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:55.520Z)

In their valuation model, what I'll do is I'll add because there will be a

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:15:57.553Z)

of the same data dump that's originally done day one,

### You (2025-05-05T18:15:59.620Z)

another database up here, which is specific to the account. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:16:01.543Z)

that would make the acquisitions person's life that would cut off hours of their day.

### You (2025-05-05T18:16:04.590Z)

whatever they input here, we'll have in in the account database and then we can just query that database for whatever data we need for a particular report. So what we would need is basically a design for the report. So that each report is is pretty standardized. And and then we just push a button and say, hey, I need my, you know, physical condition report. I push the button, and thirty seconds later, I've got a PDF of the report that I can just attach to an email and send to anybody I want. That helpful to repositions. Yeah. It seems like that's a death. Potentially improve the debt program in the you know, if we get that. An up sub file that we call package. In fact, we can even help us do the reverse. Right? We can have

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:06.173Z)

I mean, that that would be something that I think would be really helpful to acquisitions people because that

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:07.490Z)

banks you know, pay us. To have that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:10.443Z)

to the best of my knowledge, that doesn't exist today. And

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:10.610Z)

To deals that are on our system that they can go from. So that's

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:12.923Z)

it seems like that's a natural extension of what we're doing. I mean, you could potentially remove the

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:15.730Z)

you know, for different credit

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:17.663Z)

debt broker or the finance broker, you know, if if we could have

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:18.720Z)

the right to do that. This was a phrase

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:22.013Z)

you know, a a sub file

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:24.980Z)

report firms that they

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:25.213Z)

that we call the broker package, which someone could easily disseminate,

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:27.870Z)

to pay us

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:29.233Z)

in fact, we could even almost do the reverse. Right? And we can have banks

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:29.480Z)

deal. Our system. So Yeah. You know,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:32.853Z)

you know, pay us

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:34.180Z)

you know, both ways

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:34.593Z)

to have access to deals that are on our system that they can quote on. Right? So we can have

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:35.230Z)

of your oil? Just like

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:38.633Z)

lenders paying us. We could have, you know, four different appraisal firms bid on

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:40.330Z)

Yeah. Oh, yeah. When when Berecadia owned RedIQ, that was on our road map.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:43.433Z)

the right to do the acquisitions appraisal utilizing the information.

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:46.340Z)

Is that, you know, we we were servicing the brokers and the sales teams

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:47.173Z)

The same thing could be true for, you know, property conditions report firms and the hotel companies pay us a fee to, like, see what deals are being underwritten in our system. And so

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:52.700Z)

but Berecadia has this huge servicing arm

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:17:56.953Z)

you know, we can sort of have money coming, you know, both ways, if you will.

### You (2025-05-05T18:17:58.060Z)

for lenders, and

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:18:00.773Z)

And have these sub marketing processes just leveraging

### You (2025-05-05T18:18:00.800Z)

that was absolutely one of the things that we were planning on doing, was to to

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:18:03.843Z)

our technology.

### You (2025-05-05T18:18:05.160Z)

create that relationship and even perhaps have a marketplace

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:18:05.173Z)

Does that does that make sense?

### You (2025-05-05T18:18:08.870Z)

just like you said, where we've got these deals in the system lenders could pull up and see, okay, well, here's this deal. You know, You give me an opportunity to speak to the buyer or speak to the broker and create that relationship. That's Yeah. Absolutely. So so going back to what you mentioned is, will we have a version for the or whatever? All of these are the same. So when we go to market with version one, it doesn't matter. You're the investor, lender,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:18:46.273Z)

We got, you know, 50 lenders that pay us a monthly

### You (2025-05-05T18:18:46.360Z)

asset manager, or broker. It's it's all the same process. The only the only thing that differs is

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:18:50.433Z)

to look at the deals that are being underwritten in our system.

### You (2025-05-05T18:18:52.370Z)

who's using it. Right? So so, yeah, we will be able to go to all of those at at at the very beginning. The technical requirements for sharing these deals I'll work with Vinod, I don't think that that's gonna be a version one. But it's not gonna be long after. And remember, when I talk about some of these things, like MVP and version one, it's not a clean-cut. Right? You don't go from MVP and then here's version one because all of that time is when we're talking to our clients about the MVP, if they make a recommendation and we say, oh, yeah, we absolutely want to do that, we can do that. Sometimes it might take a day, it might take a week. And then we add it in there and then we go back again. Hey, do you think? We've added this feature in. And you kind of keep growing step at a time and not get that whole stair step. Kind of process between versions. So, yeah, I think I think we're all I I I from what I'm hearing, I think we're all on the same team. It's just a matter of defining what that information is or what we think the MVP is. So I'll get that document out before the end of the day, and everybody start taking a look at that. And, Mark, to your point as well, I would certainly like to think or at least to find out, is there is could we put together a standardized document that the user can push a button print, and email out. Or are we gonna find ourselves in a situation where one user might want it formatted this way, another one might want it that way. I mean, if we get into custom reporting, that gets to be a real mess real fast. Yeah. And that's one of the things. That I think, you know, perspective. Users will comment on. But Yeah. You know, a this type of book to try to impeach the lender. They try put together. Information. Price.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:09.303Z)

Yeah. I mean, I would think for purposes certainly of the initial versions, we could have

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:10.700Z)

Right. You know, if this going to state that we're gonna have to be sort of sub

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:13.943Z)

a standard subreport. And then that's one of the things that I think, you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:16.000Z)

aware.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:18.423Z)

prospective users will comment on whether they like it or not. But

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:19.030Z)

Reports. I think those are the kinds of things that will get acquisitions

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:21.473Z)

you know, oftentimes, acquisition person is underwriting. They're coming up with a

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:22.190Z)

really excited because you know, add acquisitions to their lives as opposed to say, you know, off the door.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:25.623Z)

separate book for to try to raise equity. They're coming up with a separate book to try to

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:27.610Z)

That was Oh, yeah. Yeah. Document.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:29.543Z)

appease the lender. They're trying to put together information for the appraiser. You know, they're doing 12 things with with two hands.

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:34.040Z)

Chopped up.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:35.933Z)

And you know, if this

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:37.000Z)

I want

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:37.863Z)

all this data that we're gonna have can be sort of subarranged or rearranged,

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:37.890Z)

a a different flight I wanna buy a a I you know, to report out on what I've done.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:42.233Z)

you know, in these predetermined reports. Yeah. I think those are the kinds of things that'll get acquisition

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:44.430Z)

Video to be able to check box. But what do you want?

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:46.573Z)

people really excited because it'll, you know, add hours of sleep to their lives.

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:47.410Z)

Do here?

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:50.673Z)

As opposed to staying in the office doing these endless

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:51.310Z)

Your application your credit score, and

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:53.193Z)

you know, documents. Hey.

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:54.540Z)

you know, statement

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:55.263Z)

I think the extent of any customization could probably

### You (2025-05-05T18:21:55.860Z)

you know, right, like, you know, financing

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:21:58.123Z)

be chalked up to saying, like, I wanna run a

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:00.320Z)

not to do that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:03.233Z)

this report. I wanna I wanna run a report. I wanna you know, report out on what I've done. And you know, it could be like a checkbox. Like, what do you wanna include in the reporting package

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:10.200Z)

Let the user

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:13.593Z)

that you're running this time? Do you wanna include your

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:15.860Z)

Yes. That

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:16.613Z)

acquisition assumptions, your underwriting assumptions, a p and l statement,

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:19.940Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:20.573Z)

you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:20.780Z)

Yeah. Then

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:21.443Z)

right, like, you could or do you wanna include your financing assumptions? You're probably not gonna include that. You're sending it to a bank, whatever. Maybe you do. Right? So you can you could probably you know,

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:31.310Z)

what

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:31.593Z)

click what you wanna include, and that way, you could

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:34.300Z)

creation.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:34.903Z)

let the user customize to a certain Yeah. Have, a menu menu of different reporting options.

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:35.010Z)

Of that. Deal. Write. That creation section.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:39.483Z)

Yeah. That would be great.

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:39.880Z)

Because it's digital.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:40.693Z)

But as far as but as far as, like, how it looks and all that, I think we can keep it standard.

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:41.190Z)

Co financials as historical financials and PCA is a PCA. Right? But

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:45.043Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:45.220Z)

with the customization, I mean, it's

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:45.973Z)

Part of the customization we may wanna consider, though, is that

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:47.620Z)

actually being able to have a two page summary that

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:49.533Z)

if I like, if I'm an acquisition person, right, and I'm looking at a deal and I have

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:50.960Z)

it typically defines. Your value creation strategy

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:53.753Z)

five competitors looking at it,

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:54.760Z)

We know

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:55.573Z)

it's what

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:55.810Z)

fashion one.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:22:56.683Z)

it's how I see the value creation of that deal

### You (2025-05-05T18:22:58.330Z)

Strategy,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:00.603Z)

and it's how I write up that value creation.

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:03.430Z)

report. But the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:03.713Z)

Because historical financials is historical

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:04.800Z)

secret sauce is maybe like truly, it's two pages of someone going in and

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:07.243Z)

financials. A PCA is a PCA. Right? But when

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:09.490Z)

it's part I go

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:10.263Z)

the customization may come in is actually being able to have a

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:11.000Z)

rip out. About about about B2B where maybe the

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:13.883Z)

two page summary that clearly defines

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:14.240Z)

broker said these are the five value creation ideas and

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:17.293Z)

your value creation strategy and, you know, factually why you think

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:17.830Z)

and that was personal and that those and maybe come up with some of my own.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:22.113Z)

it can be achieved. Does that make sense? Like, so much of this is just a PCA

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:24.000Z)

Hit 18 or 20% leverage by our own. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:27.083Z)

is a PCA report. But the real secret sauce is maybe

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:28.970Z)

Acquisition strategy, essentially. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:31.183Z)

like, truly, it's two pages of someone going in.

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:31.760Z)

We we we can report on data. We can't report on intentions and or assumptions. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:34.273Z)

It's the part I go in and rip out of a of a book BOV

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:38.180Z)

However,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:38.313Z)

where maybe the broker has said, these are the five value creation ideas. And

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:39.560Z)

we that is one area where AI can come in

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:42.763Z)

as an acquisition person, I wanna vet those and maybe

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:43.030Z)

and we could at least maybe give them version one.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:45.783Z)

up with some of my own as well so that I can

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:47.620Z)

Let AI write it all up, and then they can either go in there and tweak

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:48.833Z)

hit my 18 or 20% leveraged IRR.

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:51.990Z)

or

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:52.033Z)

Yeah. Such as adding their own acquisition strategy, essentially.

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:52.830Z)

they can say, you know, maybe check a box and say,

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:23:55.633Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-05T18:23:55.740Z)

No. I'll write it myself. Just give me the data, the tables, etc. We can go there. So yeah, there's there's definitely options for that. So I will continue to work on these slides get some additional clarification in there for the database I've got another slide put together that kind of mark addresses how you know, how the database is segregated by account. So, you know, visually, it, it, probably make sense if you if you see it that way in terms of security. Not much, not much concern there, really, at all. Yeah. And and maybe just in that agreement, you know, still have idea of specific. About how Yeah. Yeah. I I I will certainly do that. I my my goal is actually to kinda get this set up as a demo slide deck add some animations. Instead of getting everything there, you can kind of follow the process

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:24:59.733Z)

Yeah. And may maybe it was in that green

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:02.990Z)

through. And I'll I'll get I'll get that set up.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:25:04.503Z)

you know, cylinder they have there, maybe there's a

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:06.390Z)

It just seems it's just as a suggestion that instead of the more aggregated

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:25:06.783Z)

maybe we could just be more specific about how the information is aggregated because maybe that'll

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:12.740Z)

makes the same obvious that we should share. Others. Right. Right. Yeah. Yep. Doug, and we can we can make this we can tweak it any way we want. Alright. So, Diane, I know you, had some

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:25:29.573Z)

Yeah. Maybe it's it's just as a suggestion. Maybe instead of the word aggravated,

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:30.430Z)

connectivity issues. That's when I brought up the slide deck. Was there something else you wanted to

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:25:34.483Z)

you you say, like, secure database or something that just

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:34.890Z)

cover before you

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:25:37.703Z)

makes it seem like it's not gonna be shared with others? It it you know, in an open way.

### You (2025-05-05T18:25:44.780Z)

If as robust as everyone had hoped. But going to look to refi right now. So

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:00.962Z)

I

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:03.190Z)

even

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:03.982Z)

No. The only thing I think of is when we're thinking about initial potential

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:07.430Z)

paying customer as we're one of the first 17 customers that we have because

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:08.152Z)

paying customers, is that right now, the acquisition market is still

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:11.910Z)

we need to get through the volume of

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:14.382Z)

you know, not as robust as everyone had hoped.

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:14.570Z)

underwriting. They need to get through the check kind of process and decide what they want to lend on.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:18.072Z)

It does seem like everyone's going to look to refi right now

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:20.010Z)

And it just work in your market right now where there's

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:22.322Z)

So there are these emerging debt platforms, right, like p tree and Noble and others. I mean, and even just lenders in general, that they might be the first paying customers or one of the first set of

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:33.030Z)

So I think the you know, investors could use

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:35.012Z)

paying customers that we have because to get through the volume of

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:36.540Z)

these platforms present. Their data to the lenders. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:39.982Z)

underwriting they need to get through to kind of process and decide what they want to lend on

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:41.240Z)

Go ahead. And then I just send my customer.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:45.832Z)

it just feels like we're in a unique market right now where there's potentially more refi activity going on. Acquisitions

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:50.390Z)

Know, what we have to offer.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:53.152Z)

But, Diane, the flip side is that, you know, even if an owner is trying to refinance, they need to put together that information

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:57.570Z)

Managers don't like it.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:57.972Z)

for the lender.

### You (2025-05-05T18:26:58.530Z)

So you need to update

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:26:58.942Z)

So I think the investors could use this platform to present their data to the lenders. Yeah. And I and, Diane, I said the same with my customers

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:07.800Z)

chunk up all of our customers as potential for us.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:09.062Z)

or our customers, right, would would definitely be interested in in seeing what, you know, what we have to offer. And even Starwood Capital, which

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:15.450Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:18.742Z)

has a platform that they use to do this, Like, I know that lot of their hotel asset managers don't like it. So, you know, even in that case,

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:25.580Z)

Yeah. I I just saw that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:25.582Z)

still, I think, an interesting opportunity for us to

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:27.810Z)

The order.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:27.962Z)

present and get some buy in from them as well. So

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:28.340Z)

Of the if we think in.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:32.112Z)

definitely happy to chunk up all of our customers as potential

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:33.710Z)

Alright. Thank you. Yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:36.592Z)

first half testers.

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:40.220Z)

Alright. Alright. Appreciate the the feedback. Some really, really good comments that I'll

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:44.792Z)

Okay. So I think we're good, right, for today?

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:47.220Z)

start cleaning up these presentations. So thank you for that.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:50.102Z)

Cool. Yeah. I already I just filled out the priority of the the order of putting things in for that in the in the underwriting model.

### You (2025-05-05T18:27:55.030Z)

Alright. Oh, Alright. Thank you. Alright. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:27:58.082Z)

### Guest (2025-05-05T18:28:00.682Z)
