### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:24.425Z)

Hello? Hello?

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:24.505Z)

Hey.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:25.705Z)

How are you?

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:26.185Z)

Good. How you doing?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:28.745Z)

I am doing great.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:30.985Z)

What's that?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:32.425Z)

I'm doing great. Doing great.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:34.425Z)

Good, good.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:36.985Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:38.345Z)

Looks like you found yourself a room to meet in there.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:42.905Z)

There are very few people in here today. Even.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:47.945Z)

Ah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:48.505Z)

So much. Boss is not in. Yeah, there's a lot of space everywhere.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:52.425Z)

Cool. Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:54.665Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:00:55.945Z)

So how's everything looking?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:00:59.305Z)

Not looking great.

### You (2025-11-11T18:01:00.265Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:01:00.985Z)

Nothing there. InnVestAI is not doing great. I am really not getting dying. What? What is she doing? I don't understand. Did you see that Sunday's email? She sent. She said yeah. About? What is that company? Driftwood.

### You (2025-11-11T18:01:24.665Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:01:29.705Z)

I don't like. They are giving payment on monthly basis that they are giving, transferring to her account, out of which she is keeping most of it, giving you a little bit and that's it. I don't know why she taking all this decision on her own. Like she's not discussing with anyone. She's just treating it like this is just her company. This is not her company. It's like, now we have five partners, she has to discuss this with everyone.

### You (2025-11-11T18:01:59.625Z)

I have to bring up her email because I don't think. I mean, I. I know that she did make a comment about. Getting the money from Driftwood. But I thought it was a lot. Some check. I don't remember them saying anything about monthly payments.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:02:28.025Z)

They will pay in some monthly installment, out of which. Diane said, I'll keep 8,500. She'll give you 2,000. Rest whatever remaining we can use for something.

### You (2025-11-11T18:02:40.025Z)

Okay? I spoke to her about my portion. I'm roughly 900 out of pocket. So I do want to get reimbursed for the money that I've paid on my own. But I told her I'm not really concerned about getting a $2,000.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:03:06.105Z)

Yeah, that is a small, small portion, and that makes sense to me, really. I mean,

### You (2025-11-11T18:03:10.265Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:03:11.865Z)

You put in so much work.

### You (2025-11-11T18:03:12.265Z)

Well. Remember? The check is also contingent upon her. Doing some consulting work. So she has been actually putting together the 2026 budgets for a lot of their properties. So in my opinion, she absolutely. Is. Or absolutely should be paid for the consulting work out of the $75,000. So I don't know how it was. I don't know how it was worded. And I know Drew has sent out. In fact, just a few minutes ago, he sent out another one. An email to get with Diane to find out about the terms and to discuss this. So it's not decided. But, yeah, I understand that the thinking was InnVestAI was getting $75,000. I think what it is Diane is getting.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:04:15.945Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:04:18.905Z)

Arranged for $75,000.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:04:20.425Z)

Yeah. How my concern is the mess, right? If she's working a consulting work for them, she should just get paid and we don't have to do anything with that. InnVestAI doesn't have to do anything with that. She works, you get paid, and that's it, right?

### You (2025-11-11T18:04:36.345Z)

Yeah. No, I don't disagree.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:04:37.385Z)

Why is she involving InnVestAI in hard work and, you know, making all this mess unnecessary?

### You (2025-11-11T18:04:38.105Z)

With that. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:04:44.985Z)

She is sitting on that LLC for I don't know for how long. We are not able to open the account.

### You (2025-11-11T18:04:47.865Z)

Yeah. Yes and no. So she and I had a long chat this morning. I think. She thought it would be a good idea for her to do as much of the change to the LLC as possible because Drew was complaining about how expensive. It's going to be. So if we just provided, like, a bullet point outline and let the attorney write it, which is what should have been done. Versus her taking all of this time to try to. Make a legal document without the help of an attorney. She admits no, she was wrong. And she just. I think she just didn't understand. There's miscommunication. She thought Drew was pushing back because of the cost. She thought that she was doing the right thing by doing that. But I think she understands now. And I kind of told her, you know, I was with Drew on this. That, you know, the majority of the LLC document was good. There were only a few things that needed to be changed. And we should have just right from the very beginning, just provided a bullet point and say we need this paragraph to read this, this paragraph to read that and let the attorney put in the language. That's what they do. They could have an assistant do. It doesn't have to be that big of a deal. But what she's really been hung up on, and I think. We're good now. I explained to her. She's really concerned about the llc. Trying to account for every possible thing that could arise between the partners. And how it would be handled. And I told her, you know, I told her, you can't do that. There is no way we're going to be able to account for every potential situation that might arise. And that's what comes down to the voting. We need a super majority, and we need a majority. And I said the best way to handle this is there are only a few items. That would require supermajority. Anything else falls into the majority bucket. You don't have to say. Put together a list of items and where they belong. So she got it. She understood. And so when we talk today, you know, we're going to be in agreement that we do not have to get so deep into the weeds. That held this thing up. I just kind of wish that we had more of this type of conversation earlier. She just thought the original LLC document was just a boilerplate that. Didn't provide enough detail. And, you know, we got five founders, and how do we do this? And, you know, I just think it could have been handled simpler, and I think now she understands that. So what we need to talk about today is basically, we need two things. We need agreement on what is a supermajority. And as long as we can agree on that, then everything else just becomes a majority. We also need to discuss. But I think you know, another thing I told her is we can change this LLC at any time. So we don't. If we do have something that comes up and we think it needs to be in salesy, we make the change. But we need to. We need to as a group. Define. You know what happens when we get hit by a bus? So the llc. Accounts for five votes. So what happens if somebody gets hit by a bus and there's four people? Is it? 4 =25 percentage. Do we, at the very beginning, need to specify a survivor? Like, you know, if I had. If I put down my wife as the. You know, if anything happens to me, she gets my 20%, which is fine. That's already in the LLC. But then would she become a voting member? And a true partner. Or would she just have my 20% equity and then the other four people run it? Which then. You know, you'd have to have three versus one to get anything past, so, you know, there's. There's an issue there that we need to consider. How we would do something like that. But other than that, I think it's good to go. And the other thing is, she actually found a bank. Online bank for startups. That you don't need to have the fully executed LLC as long as you have your ein, which we have, as well as you know the state of startup. You can do that. And I also sent information months ago about Brex, which is another online bank for startups which has everything we could possibly need included and found out they're the same, they don't need to have the executed llc. So she actually filled in all of the information for Brex and we will have an account in one to three business days. So I think a lot of this whole thing about the money being deposited into her account and then transferred, I think is probably at this point, that's not an issue. We would all get a credit card for Brex, you know, so that we don't have to go to Drew and have him Venmo money and, you know, we'd be able to do that. It has, you know, credit cards, reimbursement. We could set some funds aside for reimbursing, minor charges. And, you know, online payments, so we could set up recurring payments to be sent on a particular day. I mean, pretty much everything we need. So I think we're okay, but.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:11:54.745Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T18:11:55.225Z)

Okay? And the other thing that I'm doing, and I'm in the middle of it right now, but I may have it actually finished by our call is taking Drew's spreadsheet and putting it online in our CRM. So, you know, we've got that page now where we can track our fundraising. But now we'll have another page. Where we'll have the spreadsheet, everybody will have editing. So we can add a line item, we can change a page. And it's got full logging and auditing based on Google sheets. So, you know, you can go into the audit log, it'll say, vinod changed this line item on this date. And you can click on it and it'll highlight the cells that were changed so we'll all have visibility into who's doing what. And it's got three sections. It'll have the fundraising section on the top revenue for when we start getting revenue and expenses. And we can track it each month. And if we need to add something, anybody can do it. I mean, we have to have way more visibility into everything, because Mark. Is not really sharing much information on who he's talking to and what he's got going on. And, you know, Diane's got people. You know, she and I had a really, really good conversation with another one of her contacts today. He was a former CEO of Radisson, and he's been in the business, and he's now leading one of the major groups with Airbnb. He's got a ton of connections, some of them which could be investors, some of them which could be partners. I mean, and we've got another call with somebody today at 4:00. I mean, she's busting. She's doing way more than Mark when it comes to raising the funds, so. You know, we're. We're just gonna have to be able to track who's doing what, what money's coming in. What money is going out. And be able.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:14:09.225Z)

For Dai particularly, I do think she needs to be more organized because she looked kind of lose trust on that one. Because Mia, I'm thinking like, can she really run this organization as a CEO who is a top boss of the company and take major decision? Because if she message up so much like even the smaller things,

### You (2025-11-11T18:14:16.905Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:14:31.385Z)

Then it's going to be mess all the time.

### You (2025-11-11T18:14:33.065Z)

Y. Eah. No, that's true. That's true. I think Driftwood would be the only situation where we would be. Exchanging labor. For an investment. I think it's just because she had personal contacts, there would be a way to get in. So hopefully this is just a one off situation and once we get the bank set up, You know, we can deposit directly into the bank. Everybody has visibility. We would be able to monitor and control. So, yeah, I agree this this very first one was not handled as good as it could have been. But I don't think it's hopefully a big issue that Drew. Is concerned about when it comes to the safe note, so we'll see.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:15:30.265Z)

Yeah, it's not just Rosh, because I was also I read through that email on Weekend. I didn't understand what is going on. I was like, okay, whatever it is, I just left it there. But yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:15:46.265Z)

That email back up so I can read the details again.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:15:52.025Z)

I put the expense sheet. I'm getting 8500. How it will keep in 2000. See, I don't have issue with that. The only issue I have is don't treat it as just your decision. Like discuss with people. Like, this is what we're going to do. Like. I understand. Yeah. You started to grow. We are the boss. But now it's not just, you know, it's not your own company.

### You (2025-11-11T18:16:12.505Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:16:18.425Z)

We all are equal partner. We have to discuss everything with each other, right?

### You (2025-11-11T18:16:21.785Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Honestly. She never even asked me about the 2000. When I read that, I was. Like, how did she come up with that? So, yeah, so I'm seeing. The math doesn't add up. Because she's getting, she says, a proration of the 75,000, which is 12,500 per month for November, December. Well, 125 is only 25,000. Where's the other 50? Coming in.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:16:59.225Z)

Probably rest of the months. For a few more months.

### You (2025-11-11T18:17:02.185Z)

Well, she only mentions November and December. Says. In fact, I'm reading that I suggested to them that they pay us in November and December the monthly proration. Which is $12,500 per month. But. That's only 2,500. Where's the other 75? And so that $2,000 left over will only be from the first installment of the 12:5. And she's also saying that we agreed in the budget she'll take 8,500, which I recall having those conversations. So I don't think she's overstepping there. But her math doesn't add up. You know, when do we get the other 50,000? So we need to get that. And then, like I said, we've already resolved the whole bank issue.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:17:53.625Z)

Even a one distributing that fund. Right. If we had to distribute the fund first we had to figure out who is paying. Right? Now why is Drew and Mark paying? They are not our investor. We should, you know, give whatever they have paid back and start paying from our our thing. Plus. Right. Secondly, we have to pay our offshore. Team.

### You (2025-11-11T18:18:14.025Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:18:14.265Z)

Literally. They can. They can go anywhere. We are not paying them anything.

### You (2025-11-11T18:18:15.705Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:18:18.265Z)

There are no benefits, no proper onboarding, no proper payment, no on time payment, even though they have done so much work.

### You (2025-11-11T18:18:20.185Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:18:26.505Z)

We should have thought of those parties before. We are thinking about ourselves, right? I mean, I understand Diane is unemployed for some time. She needs money. That's understood. But still, I mean. That thing didn't go very well, in my understanding.

### You (2025-11-11T18:18:44.665Z)

Yeah. No. All right, so. So. So let's put it this way. There will be more than 2000. If I only take the the 900 that I paid out of pocket, that would actually leave a little over $3,000. To cover whatever expenses. So if we have the bank, like I said, we can set up an automatic payment so we. We know that they'll get paid on time. And not delayed. Which is, which would only help for the short term because we did talk about then setting up, you know, the LLC or the private company, India, and come up with budgets. That, that will be a 2026 thing, though. We can't do that like now. We just don't have the funds. But now in December, that full 12,500 would go into the operating of it. So, you know, we. We could have between now and the end of the year, let's just say $15,000 instead of the 2,000. This month we get 3,000. And at that point, then we can start covering the cost of what it would take to set up that private company in India and whatever benefits we need to provide. So.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:20:03.705Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So I. I don't really want. It won't be much. Expenses first, and I. I'll cover that from my own expense because I want to separate to keep that company separate. Because if there's anything else I have to do, I can do with that company, but whatever resources I have right now. Or whatever hiring we have to do. Will do it through this company.

### You (2025-11-11T18:20:29.625Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah, it sounds like you were eavesdropping on our conversation, because we. We pretty much touched on all this, including Mark Andrews payroll. And this is something we. We're gonna have to. You know, I don't know if it's gonna come down to a vote or what. Basically the way that we had it budgeted is that we get paid fairly the same amount. I think she had you a little bit higher than the rest. But, you know, Drew, Mark, Diane and I were getting, I don't know, what, 8,500amonth or something like that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:21:10.425Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:21:11.545Z)

Why would Mark and Drew get 8,500amonth when they're not putting in 40 hours? That's assuming a full time job. And Diane even said that when she put those numbers together, she was assuming that Drew and Mark would be working pretty much full time, which obviously they're not. I don't know how many hours Drew is putting in.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:21:30.745Z)

But the other thing, Howard. If. If this. Yeah, yeah. If Mark is able to, like, say, get some good funding. Billion of funding or get good sales. So I don't really care about his hours.

### You (2025-11-11T18:21:45.065Z)

No. In fact, well, that's kind of what we talked about, is that maybe he should not get any salary. But he should get a commission based on what he brings in. Which he may end up getting way more than what he would on a salary.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:22:00.985Z)

Yet. If he agrees to that. Right. But if he doesn't, then even if we pay. Yeah, even if we pay him 8,500, he's able to bring in, say, million dollar of funding or sale. We don't mind paying him 8,500.

### You (2025-11-11T18:22:13.785Z)

Right, but this is something that was originally outlined in the llc. And before we sign the llc, we'll have to have an agreement. That basically, at a minimum, they're paid on a pro rata basis. So If Drew works 10 hours a week on InnVestAI, he would get 25% of the 8,500. They've also said that they. They don't want to get the paycheck now. They'll just let it accrue, which is fine. Let it accrue. And then same thing for Mark. You know, I don't know if Marx. The only thing I can think of that he's actually done labor wise, is the pitch deck. And he's provided me with a couple of Excel spreadsheets. So I don't know. He might be putting in two hours a week, right?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:23:11.785Z)

He's definitely not putting our same.

### You (2025-11-11T18:23:12.985Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Why would he get the same salary as everybody else? And I just think the nature of his job, and we've had many conversations about this, so I do think we need to get an agreement. On their salaries before we can sign the LLC instead of trying to go back and change it afterward. But I think we're almost there.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:23:46.185Z)

I mean, if you look at Mark's network, right, he does have good network. So if we anticipate that he'll do good sales or find good funding, you know, down, you know, in December or next year, probably, it should be. Fine.

### You (2025-11-11T18:24:00.985Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:24:02.025Z)

I don't want to take risk of losing him or, you know, him to do bad mouthing.

### You (2025-11-11T18:24:07.145Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:24:08.665Z)

Something like that.

### You (2025-11-11T18:24:09.705Z)

Well, that's one of the reasons why I put together that online tool is because. I think that both Mark and Drew are pushing back on. Getting funding because they don't want to dilute the owner's share. And I'm in 100% agreement. I don't want to get more funding that we need, but you gotta have some funding. You know? So one of the things we do need to do in the LLC is actually make three pools. Right now, I think there's just one pool for employees. But we would need to have three equity pools, so we need one for employees, for all. Employees, but they typically only get 0.2 to 0.5% is a typical employee. But then we need a pool for key employees. We need to hire a cfo, we need to hire a salesperson. These people would not be partners, but they would need way more equity than 0.5%. Those typically go from like 2 to 5%. Right. And then the third pool for whoever's investing. So we would get equal split of what's left over after those three pools. Which is. Which is fine. And then we were talking about the fact, well, Drew and Mark already put in some money. But that doesn't give them additional ownership shares. They still get 20%. And that's it. No more, no less. But there would be participating in that third pool. They would be just like any other investor that gives us money. So they would get a portion of that third pool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:25:53.225Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:26:03.625Z)

As.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:26:04.985Z)

A better thing. We just return their money, whatever they spent, and then we come on the same line.

### You (2025-11-11T18:26:09.865Z)

Can do that. If they're good with that, that's fine. We could reimburse them.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:26:15.065Z)

Yeah, why not? I mean, it's not been. Not even. It's just been three months. If they want to charge us interest, we can pay them interest and just.

### You (2025-11-11T18:26:23.225Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:26:24.425Z)

Return their money. And then, you know, nobody is more iniquity than everybody's kind of in similar equity.

### You (2025-11-11T18:26:25.705Z)

Yeah. But it could benefit us, though, too. Right? So if Martin drew our concern about diluting. Then the more that they put in. The less dilution we would get, because they would then get it. You know, if you think about it, we've got 75,000 coming in. From one client. Their percentage is, you know, just a small slice of the pie. Their percentage of equity that they would get from the investment would be fairly small. But, you know, what we would do is we could set aside a certain percentage of for pot for this group. Three investors. And the fewer investors we get. We can move some of that equity back into the ownership pie so we get a bigger slice of the pie and, you know, the other then, you know, we'd just be down to the smaller percentage of the other ones, so it could benefit us if. If they do something like that, but. But that that's why they mentioned is because they're Diane thinks they're pushing back. And we need to have a tool out there that shows. Other than the Excel spreadsheet. Where we can track audit, see who's making what changes. We could. We could put together a graph that shows, okay, well, here's our expense or revenue growing slowly. Here's our expenses. We can say, okay, here's the point where we would break even and start making money and, you know, just be beneficial to do that. So. Yeah, I don't know how. I mean, I think today's call is gonna be good. I don't think it's gonna be contentious in any way, but we've got a lot of stuff to cover.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:28:17.145Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-11T18:28:26.505Z)

And we. We gotta get this thing nailed down. So.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:28:34.985Z)

We sit on very, very small distance forever, like LLC and all this. We're not gonna make lot of progress. We'll always have this deadlock in making decisions. We have to have a smooth decision making because that's how startup succeed. That's why startups succeed, because they can make decisions. If you're working like big, like, you know, we are entangled like big companies and we not grow, somebody else will come and just take away all this opportunity or the niche. We had.

### You (2025-11-11T18:29:08.985Z)

All right, well, you know, let's. Let's talk about that today. You know, like I said. It would really simplify things if we define what requires the supermajority, what requires majority. So that when we do have these disagreements, We put it to a vote.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:29:30.425Z)

And the other things is roles and responsibility as well, like who is doing sales, who is doing marketing. Who is they should be just discussed. I know these are like tough talks, but we need to do that. Unless we get them cleared or we'll just be there. You know, Mark will be thinking he's doing sales then would be he would doing sales. And I don't know what Drew is thinking, what he's gonna do.

### You (2025-11-11T18:29:56.265Z)

Drew, I think is. Titled Chief Operating Officer is what they put down on the llc, which means just the day to day operations. So we would. Yeah, we do need to define exactly what falls into those categories. But, you know, I've said it all along. I am not in favor of Mark being in charge of sales. And his title is just Capital Markets, which is fundraising. His title does not say Chief Sales Officer or marketing or anything like that, so. If that's the case, and he's been in his mind, the capital markets, I don't see how he would or why he would push back. On not being in charge of sales.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:30:51.145Z)

Right? I mean, if he does. Do we want to give him? A chance. Or we just say. No, we cannot do sales. Because what is equal to. But I don't know, considering his network. Because that's what I have been thinking since beginning, right? I always thought that he would do sales because he had good network.

### You (2025-11-11T18:31:16.025Z)

Yes. But. I view him more as. A conduit. To introduce a professional salesperson to his contacts. You know, he could make the introductions, he can schedule the meetings, he can be in the meetings, he can lead the meetings. But ultimately, when it comes down to getting a commitment and assign, you know, signature on a contract, I would leave that up to the salesperson.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:31:53.225Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:31:53.625Z)

Or use. Let them partner on it because I've said all along. SaaS, sales, technical sales. Is a world apart. From brokerage and selling fixed assets, buildings and hotels and things like that. Totally different sales process. Takes a totally different skill set. So, I mean, if he is successful at it, he would be. One in a million.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:32:30.265Z)

Y. Eah. Let's see. I think yeah, we should have these conversation sooner. The better so that we get clarity on things otherwise. We are in a deadlock forever.

### You (2025-11-11T18:32:43.625Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:32:44.105Z)

And, you know, if we keep sitting on these distance for a long time, I don't know, we know. Move forward, whatever. You know, he comes in, he goes out. At least we'll know what's gonna happen.

### You (2025-11-11T18:32:55.305Z)

Yeah. Yeah. All right, well. I do know that Diane is. Softening her position towards Mark, where at first she thought that he was the only and best option. She even made a comment in a call we had last week that really took me by surprise and that she says, you know, LARC's not the only person has these contacts. There are other people we could bring in, some like. All right, maybe she's willing to draw the line in the sand. And if he doesn't like it.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:33:18.585Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:33:37.785Z)

Adios. I don't know. I don't. I don't think it'll ever come to that. But she is starting to question, you know, who's bringing to the table.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:33:48.985Z)

We need to find like we need to have those discussion upfront sooner than later really. A mark has to go, then Martin is to go on time. We don't want to waste lot of time. We need to figure out who is gonna do sales.

### You (2025-11-11T18:33:52.665Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:34:01.625Z)

If he's gonna stay again.

### You (2025-11-11T18:34:04.105Z)

That's the stance we need to take when it comes down to, you know, paying amount of commission instead of a salary like this.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:34:11.305Z)

Why don't we do that discussion today?

### You (2025-11-11T18:34:12.825Z)

I think we should. I think we should.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:34:15.545Z)

Rip told. Everybody's responsibility. Just, you know, forget about what's going on. Forget about that expense sheet. Let's do that discussion today. I'm still sitting here.

### You (2025-11-11T18:34:24.825Z)

Well, if today's discussion is going to be focused on the llc, then that's the perfect time to bring it up because we would have to make changes to that portion of the llc.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:34:36.425Z)

Even before llc. I think we need to discuss that. And then we'll make the changes to llc. And yeah, I don't think it's gonna go smooth, but we need to have those discussions. We don't then just gonna be there forever.

### You (2025-11-11T18:34:52.025Z)

Yeah. Okay? All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:34:57.785Z)

Delta, and we're gonna discuss this. Thing about what she's gonna talk about.

### You (2025-11-11T18:35:05.465Z)

Yeah. So from the development standpoint, how are we looking?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:35:13.625Z)

I think the map is good. There's my app on both the pages. Year zero Raj is making some progress. I think UIUX is almost done. And then we did take few of the points that drew, as mentioned in the new sheet.

### You (2025-11-11T18:35:30.745Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:35:30.985Z)

So, yeah, I think making some good progress there.

### You (2025-11-11T18:35:34.905Z)

All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:35:36.665Z)

But we do need to make this thing. Form light. Sooner or later I am on top of that. Guys, I'm sitting on his head to register this company. I did have one company registered a long back. But this guy, he has lost that income tax number. They call it pan car number in India. He has lot. He. He said oh I've thrown that. Card somewhere. I don't know whether he's telling me the truth. Or where he's saying, I don't have it, so I cannot really go with that. So I'm kind of registering a new company so that we can have a formal set, entire formal setup. So we'll, you know, run their payroll, they'll have their salary slip, they'll have their benefits. And everything. So our cost will go up for sure anyways. There's barely any cost right now. We do need to bring that up sooner or later. But, yeah, we need to take care of that because I don't want to lose any of these guys. If we lose these, then we don't really have anything.

### You (2025-11-11T18:36:35.545Z)

Are these companies, ones that we would consider to be outsourcing, where we basically hire these companies to do this on their behalf and they have other clients that they do the same thing.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:36:49.705Z)

So the new company that I'm registering right now, Right, there's not going to be any other client except Investi. But yeah, it will work just like consulting companies does, right? It's kind of consulting on behalf of industryi. Instead of us running their payroll and doing everything. That company will take care of that.

### You (2025-11-11T18:37:05.065Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:37:11.305Z)

I think that's the easiest way to do it. And that that company will run the Ben payroll, whatever.

### You (2025-11-11T18:37:17.465Z)

Yeah. Well, my concern is we would want to. I mean, whoever we. Work with would have to be insured. You know, I want to make sure that we're protected. That, you know, whoever we work with is an expert in the field. Knows how to set this up. Make sure all the eyes are dotted T's across and that we can just basically. Let them. Administer the payroll benefits, etc. So, yeah, I don't want somebody just taking our money and then find out that our team hasn't been paid and they don't get the benefits, and then this person has, you know, gone off and bought themselves a little villa in the Bahamas.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:38:07.545Z)

That's not done. That's not going to happen for sure. I mean, you don't pay, these guys won't be around for sure. But these guys are so talented. They do things so differently than we are used to. Because I can see how the guys who work in corporate world for long, like more experienced people. They're more performant than these guys because these guys are so focused that they want to, like, they just want to crank out the work, and they want to learn and deliver things. I can say the difference between Arjun who is more experienced than these guys. So. I mean, anyone we pick from this company, they're like. They're just used to working environment, right? They think that what happens just this way. That create a pbi. Give me a pbi. I'll take these many days, complete that pbi, and that's it. I mean, in today's age, especially in startups, we cannot function that slow. And, you know, expect everything to be fed like.

### You (2025-11-11T18:39:19.785Z)

Right. No, I agree. All right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:39:25.465Z)

I mean, these guys cannot even function. Like, they take. These guys can function just on the instructions. But I see things with Art and, like, he needs everything in proper way, and then he can function, and I can. I can understand where that comes from. That's how we work in bigger companies.

### You (2025-11-11T18:39:45.225Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:39:47.545Z)

Like you don't want to figure out things. You don't want to find out different routes. You just follow whatever instruction you are given.

### You (2025-11-11T18:40:01.065Z)

Yeah, I think. We're. I don't think there's anything else I need to do from a documentation standpoint, I think. Everything that has been sent should be enough. So, I mean, if there's a way that I can help and give them any guidance or whatever, just let me know.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:40:21.545Z)

Yeah, I mean, I think you do help in our Friday's call, so that's. That's good. The lender dashboard. You guys are already. Talking about the. Once that is finalized, I'll take that over and, you know, we can have discussion around that as well.

### You (2025-11-11T18:40:36.505Z)

Yeah. I know I can't get into the weeds and prioritize down to the PBI level because I don't have a background. I don't know what order things should be done. So I think the best I can do is provide an outline of. The final deliverables. But if you're having.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:40:53.705Z)

Yeah, no, I think. What? Yeah, whatever you have been doing there is super helpful.

### You (2025-11-11T18:40:58.665Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:40:59.705Z)

You see, putting together the formula document. That's what we need to do right now. Once we are very big team and, you know, then we'll. We'll see how to do things in a better way. But, yeah, I remember we did talk about, you know, putting PBIS and all that, but my involvement with work and other things kind of.

### You (2025-11-11T18:41:17.545Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:41:21.545Z)

I. I'm left with very limited time. So I'm trying to focus on what is most important. Rather than putting that time on PBI and all that.

### You (2025-11-11T18:41:33.385Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:41:33.785Z)

But for now, I think, yeah, if we could just get everything done so that these demos and everything can happen, then, you know, we'll have.

### You (2025-11-11T18:41:33.865Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:41:42.185Z)

Better funding, and then we'll structure everything in bed. Ola.

### You (2025-11-11T18:41:46.025Z)

Yeah. All right. All right, cool. Yeah, I can't think of anything else.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:41:55.465Z)

Yeah, driftwood thing. Like, are they going to be investor or what? What? So that safe note thing, they're investor, right?

### You (2025-11-11T18:42:06.345Z)

Yeah, yeah. Safe note.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:42:07.305Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T18:42:09.625Z)

Actually, I. I had the email open when I was going through Diane's first email while we were talking, and then I realized that Diana Drew have just replied to each other, so. I have read through the whole thing, but I think Drew is still a little bit perturbed, so. I'm going to touch base with Diane real quick and tell her that I will be happy to bring up some of these issues in the call.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:42:38.185Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T18:42:40.505Z)

You know. See, you see what she says there? I mean. The fact that we've addressed the bank part.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:42:49.705Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T18:42:49.865Z)

Without. You know, how she's already gone and applied for the bank would probably set you off. It's like, why? You know, why is she making this decision? Well, Why? Drew. What? Why are you making the decision? So. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:43:06.025Z)

We need to make faster decisions. And it doesn't matter who makes them, as far as they are, the distance are. You know what we need.

### You (2025-11-11T18:43:09.225Z)

Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:43:14.505Z)

Right? We cannot just sit on that bank account LSC forever. We need to move forward.

### You (2025-11-11T18:43:20.105Z)

Yep. Okay. All right, let me. Let me. Let me check with Diane real quick. And anyway. Yeah. Should be an interesting call. I don't think. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:43:33.945Z)

Yeah, I think it is going to be interesting.

### You (2025-11-11T18:43:35.945Z)

We can keep it from getting contentious. We just need to have cool heads. And everybody get on the same page here. So.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:43:46.345Z)

When people are like, I would say let it get contagious so that people can speak out what. What they are holding back. Whatever is in their heart. Then we'll come to know, like, what's going on, right?

### You (2025-11-11T18:43:58.505Z)

Yeah, that's not necessary. Bad things.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:43:59.545Z)

I don't know what's going on between Drew and Mark. And I don't know what. What is going on.

### You (2025-11-11T18:44:03.545Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:44:06.025Z)

In, Diane said, why is she sitting on the LLC forever?

### You (2025-11-11T18:44:10.345Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:44:11.625Z)

So, yeah, let it get contagious and, you know, will listen it out. Let's see what's going on.

### You (2025-11-11T18:44:16.025Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:44:18.105Z)

And even. Yeah. Like that thing that she's working, getting fun, and to InnVestAI then InnVestAI paying her or however that. I just didn't understand that message. Get paid directly for get invested airport time being. Get paid for your work. Whatever work she's doing for them, just get paid for that directly. Rather than involving Investia in.

### You (2025-11-11T18:44:48.825Z)

All right. Yeah, I can't think of anything else now. Probably because I haven't had lunch yet. I need to get some food.

### Guest (2025-11-11T18:44:56.425Z)

All right. Looking. Yeah, even me. I'm hungry.

### You (2025-11-11T18:45:01.065Z)

Yeah. Yeah. All right. We'll see you in a while. Take care.
