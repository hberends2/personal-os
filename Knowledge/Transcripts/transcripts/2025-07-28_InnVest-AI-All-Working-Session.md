8.

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:15.774Z)

Hey. How are you? Good.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:18.539Z)

Good. How are you? What's that?

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:20.484Z)

So you're home already. I said you're home already.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:23.739Z)

Yep. Yep. I started at four. So least.

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:31.984Z)

You you're you're in the office four days a week. Right? Or do they have you come

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:36.359Z)

The

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:36.674Z)

days?

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:37.459Z)

No. I I'm supposed to go days, but I don't think I'm going four days sometimes.

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:42.284Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:43.199Z)

Three days, sometimes two days. So

### You (2025-07-28T21:30:45.444Z)

Alright. Yeah. Because I couldn't remember if Monday or Friday was the day that you usually are home. So must be Friday? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:30:55.399Z)

Must be Friday. Yeah. It's Friday. Yeah. And then in between, I can do it.

### You (2025-07-28T21:31:00.944Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:31:01.119Z)

On my own and it's on my own.

### You (2025-07-28T21:31:01.574Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:31:04.719Z)

Hello, everyone. Alright. Hey, guys. Hey. Hello.

### You (2025-07-28T21:31:09.854Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:31:11.969Z)

Can you guys I have ambient noise in the background. Is it

### You (2025-07-28T21:31:16.824Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:31:16.859Z)

you guys hear that or no? No. Not at all. Good. Yeah. Are the kids screaming, or is it what's the ambient noise? Right now, it's TV on distracting, screaming kid. But at any moment, it could change. Got it. Alright. So where do we wanna start? Maybe an update of what what one like, kind of the the updates from the weekend. Is that a good place to start? Because I know we have to talk about that. Have to talk about the operating agreement because, Drew, you need that for the bank account. Right? And that's Yeah. Yep. And then don't know if if you guys maybe an update if you've talked to Lark or anything like that because I know you and were talking about that on Friday. Yeah. Why don't we start there? Because I had an I had an interesting conversation today, if you don't mind. Yep. That'd be great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Drew had spoken with Ryan, and then said I would speak to Dan. So Dan and I spoke today. And, I kinda just described what we're doing. And, Dan, you got very excited in in a good way. And kind of admitted that know, they as a company have talked about this for a long time but never really got their act together. In terms of building anything. And, you know, he thought that conceptually, this was a fantastic idea. You know, he sort of said if you guys need any money, you know, feel free to reach out, which is that kind of Good. Baited him along a little bit. Figured that makes Ian happy. Yeah. That would make me That's a good news. I thought that was a good way to start today's call. So

### You (2025-07-28T21:32:48.204Z)

Does that have to be for investing in

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:32:50.159Z)

anyway, it was a very positive

### You (2025-07-28T21:32:52.004Z)

us, or can we just reach out for money? I mean, I was just

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:32:52.229Z)

Yeah. It's Yeah. It's sort of one of the same. But the

### You (2025-07-28T21:32:57.864Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:32:59.019Z)

but, yeah, it was a very good call. He was very excited. He was happy to hear about it, and he kind of admitted that know, he knows the industry needs this, but they haven't been able to to focus on it enough to do it themselves.

### You (2025-07-28T21:33:08.064Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:33:11.509Z)

That is really positive. That's awesome. So what did you guys

### You (2025-07-28T21:33:12.404Z)

Yeah. Great news. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:33:15.669Z)

what what's would be between and then you talked to Ryan. Drew, is that only I exchanged emails with Ryan last week and just very, very like, one sentence explained what we were doing, which, again, it's like, he and I have been talking about this for years. Mhmm. And I just said that, you know, it's a new kind of a new product for us. I I don't think I really even I mentioned afterwards that it was with you guys. Like I mentioned, Diane and Mark, you guys, and and Ryan did say he knew knew both of you. And and I just said, like, let's let's talk about it. He said, yeah. He'd love to love to hear more You know? And he he said the same thing, but they've talked about doing it internally, but just didn't you know, weren't able to it seemed too cost prohibitive, you know, for them to to wanna embark on on this So he said that they didn't ever pursue it. But he's really excited about would be excited about the opportunity to work with us on it. That is awesome. So where what do you guys think are the next steps on something? I have a call with him I have a call with him on Wednesday. Morning or tomorrow morning. I have a call with him Wednesday morning. To just it's a it's a thirty minute call. Just I don't even know if I'll go down the road of a demo. I probably would just be very it'd probably just be a conversation. Mhmm. To refresh both our minds, our memories on, like, kinda, like, what this would look like and how it would work. And I'll talk about each of you guys, you know, so you can understand more about the team that we have at play. And and then I hope that his next steps will be the same of, yeah. Sure. Like, I'll share some data with you. You guys come back to me when you're ready to talk about, you know, the application or or the route or testing. Got it. Got it. And, Mark, from your side, is it with Dan? Is it, like, after Labor Day, we do the demo with him, or do you think it'd be worthwhile, like, Ellen to do it earlier? Yeah. I mean, Dan pretty much works seven days a week. You know, he's always available. You know? Hotels are his hobby and his work. So he probably, like, dreamed about hotels. But but anyway, that's probably more information than you want. But the but he's available anytime to do a demo, my my gut. Is that I'd love for us to be like, put him in our second round of of demos. Let's go through it with a few people first. Let's get the feedback. Let's do some tweaking. I'd like to be a little bit more polished before we show it to him. Because he could be an investor too. Yeah. So I I I would prefer to hold off unless you guys disagree. Okay. That's good. No. That's good. So he'll be on our after labor Day. Hit list. Yeah. Yeah. Because I think I think we should treat him as much as an investor as a tester. Okay. Alright. That's great news. What a wonderful way to a 05:30 part of it from my perspective is just that he kind of admitted that knows the industry needs this. He thought about doing it himself, but he just never got his act together. So to me, that was kind of the best feedback we get.

### You (2025-07-28T21:36:06.504Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:36:06.909Z)

Yep. Yeah. Agreed. That proves that this product is a good market fit.

### You (2025-07-28T21:36:12.464Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:36:12.999Z)

Yes. Exactly. Alright. And then maybe we handle the other well, maybe we just handle the housekeeping thing before we get into progress. In the weekend, which is the operating agreement. And I was I mean, is this something that we could just sign the operating agreement, get it notarized so that you could get the bank account open. And then if we need to make any changes, we just agree that if there's modifications that we have to make, we'll make them. Yeah. That was my thought. It it I mean, it does look like it needs there's a section for notary for and each of us would need to get it individually notarized. Which is a little bit annoying. But How many pages is the doc how many pages is the agreement? It's 35 or so. Yeah. Most of it's most of it's text. It's just there's only a few things to fill in which are pretty straightforward. Is can you just email to me, like, in a in one document, or is that I just wanna Yeah. Okay. I mean, my thought was we could I don't know if this violates what notaries are supposed to do, but if we just you just take the one page that needs to get notarized, and then you sign that I don't know if that can a notary do that? Yeah. I think that's fine. Notary's job is only just to witness that you're actually signing the newspaper. The notary doesn't really care what's in the document. They just wanna

### You (2025-07-28T21:37:35.094Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:37:36.729Z)

often ask, like, what it is. But their job is really just to confirm that the person who's signing is the real person. Yeah. That's what I figured. So I will email you each of you the individual page, and you just gotta print it and get it notarized and send it back as soon as possible. And then I'll consolidate all of it, fill out the missing pieces, at least enough, that we can get the, account opened. I mean, if you send me if you could send me the whole thing because I would like to just Yes. Take a quick look at it. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:03.084Z)

So question I have is, are we doing this out of order? Because the five of us are signing as what? We we are not

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:12.629Z)

Members,

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:14.164Z)

really partners or members of anything yet. I don't think the LLC has been

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:17.819Z)

Oh, well, I think this is the end. This the operating agreement is the LLC agreement.

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:24.334Z)

Oh, okay. I thought I thought this

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:25.109Z)

And it's the one that I took from Harvard. It's the direct LLC agreement that came from the company that incorporated us in Delaware.

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:33.334Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:35.209Z)

It's pretty straightforward. I mean, I I the only thing that caught my attention was, like, if there's capital calls, but

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:42.524Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:43.199Z)

I I mean, at this point, we don't even have we don't have you know, we don't have any of that.

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:47.764Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:48.169Z)

So I

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:48.814Z)

I I misunderstood because Drew was asking for the signatures. I thought it was for the bank account. And that we all had to sign for that. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:38:55.089Z)

It yeah. So it's like LLC. Yeah. LLC was was created.

### You (2025-07-28T21:38:57.184Z)

right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:39:00.359Z)

And then we have to get the operating agreement, which sort of outlines ownership structure and and who the officers are and all that. And that needs to happen before we get the bank account. And so the next thing after we do

### You (2025-07-28T21:39:11.054Z)

Right. Right. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:39:12.549Z)

sign all this is to be the bank account, and then I think that's pretty much most of what we need from a from this know,

### You (2025-07-28T21:39:18.424Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:39:19.269Z)

line of of work. And I don't think we have to worry way behind on catching up on it else. You know? But I won't take time with this call probably. I'll catch one there. I didn't see the papers, think, but the it really saying it is done, so I'm happy that it's I'll I'll I'll send it I'll send it to all to all of you. I mean, Diane sent it out previously, but I'll send it again. Diane did. Diane did, but I I didn't see what it is.

### You (2025-07-28T21:39:42.424Z)

Didn't didn't I didn't what Diane send out

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:39:42.539Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:39:45.554Z)

just wasn't it just the blank forms? Because there's there's been a lot of emails. I don't know. I I went to try to find an email with the LLC, but

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:39:52.969Z)

Also, I I have a I can send it again to you, and I also did a summary in

### You (2025-07-28T21:39:59.074Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:00.489Z)

in perplexity of it, so it would be easy for us to see. So I'll send both of those

### You (2025-07-28T21:40:03.214Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:05.459Z)

back out to everyone.

### You (2025-07-28T21:40:05.554Z)

is is that the one where you sent it in three parts?

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:06.909Z)

So Yeah. It was because there are there's the LLC agreement, and then there are these, like, membership I don't know. Certificates is what it almost looks like that we each get one.

### You (2025-07-28T21:40:19.794Z)

I saw this certificate. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:21.699Z)

Yep. And we've all agreed we're 20% partners. I think that's what has to get filled in, and our names have to get filled in. And then the rest of it is pretty straightforward. Mark brought up this really great point about the the I think it's the 83 b Yeah. Tax election. But we don't have to worry. I I did research that, and we don't have to worry about that until we actually issue stock, right, which we're not doing at this point in the LLC agreement.

### You (2025-07-28T21:40:51.144Z)

Okay. I I I could not find that attachment. I I

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:52.129Z)

So no.

### You (2025-07-28T21:40:56.014Z)

hopefully, don't know if I deleted it. But, yeah, if Drew, are you you're able to send it out again? Or

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:40:59.319Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:41:00.954Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:41:03.279Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Any other housekeeping stuff? Just just as an FYI, there is a I've put together I used one of my existing templates for a contractor agreement. To give and so now it's gonna have Raj and Shivam sign that. I think I'm still doing some research, but you know, did you have a chance to ask them the question that I had I asked you about whether they are registered with the it's like an Indian regulatory body for foreign work contract work. So there's something called PAN card, you need to file the taxes in India. I think Raj has it, but not Shivam. I'll ask him to get that. Okay. Get as far as this payment goes, if the plan is required, we can, you know, pay on his mom's or parents account. Okay. If that is mandatory. I I don't know if it's mandatory. I was kinda hoping that they would know whether it was mandatory. Right? Like, this the degree to which No. I I don't think it is mandatory. They can accept payment on their account. It's mandatory when they they have to file the tax But from company perspective, I'm not sure whether we require it. Do we require Yeah. It it looked like you could go either way. Like, you know, we as a company can pay in such a way that we either deduct taxes or or, like, indicate to the tax authorities that we're paying them, or we can not do that. And they can just do it themselves latter is probably is obviously easier for us, and it's such a small it's it's like, you know, it's only two people. It's not like a huge you know, team of people that at this point, I think it's probably fine to do it the simpler method. Do a little bit more research on it, though, and I'll try to get that contractor agreement to you this week. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. So then from there, why don't we jump in and just catch everyone up on, like, what happened the the progress over the weekend and the progress with the MVP? Because it looks like there's just a lot a lot of progress that's been made. And then I know Howard has you guys a call this morning. So why don't I'll just I'll just turn it maybe over to Howard. Do you wanna just, like, kind of walk us through? And then, Drew and Vinod, you guys can jump in. Sound okay?

### You (2025-07-28T21:43:34.494Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I can I can go ahead and start? So one one of the things I wanted to address first is, you know, some of the communication and and how we how we need to handle the communication as we go through here. You know, because quite frankly, at at at a couple couple times I had a near panic attack. Because there's all of these emails going back and forth and suggestions and and some of them, they I mean, they weren't always the same subject and it was really hard to keep track of. So I I I know Vinod and I are probably the only ones who have worked in an organization with product management and engineering and everything else. I know this has Mark and Diane. You've never been in the software service or software industry before, so I'm not sure this is new to you. Drew, I don't know if you're familiar with product management or not. If you know, when you started yours a little bit. But

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:44:34.819Z)

No.

### You (2025-07-28T21:44:37.134Z)

I'm just I'm just I'm just gonna take a couple minutes here to kinda outline what it is that product management is in this organization. And how we need to organize communication and why. So I think the easiest way to explain this is product management is the bridge between the stakeholders and that could be internal and external stakeholders. And engineering. Right? Product manager has to kind of straddle both worlds. I have to be able to take what what we want to build why we wanna build it, document that, in a way that the engineers can then pick up and run with it. Right? So if there's communication going back and forth without going over that bridge, right, it gets lost. It can become very, very chaotic.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:45:33.079Z)

It's now

### You (2025-07-28T21:45:33.944Z)

So so

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:45:34.469Z)

worth It's like tough.

### You (2025-07-28T21:45:35.754Z)

the to kind of further illustrate here, this is this is really what I'm talking about that's that's broken down in a little bit more detail. So we've got internal stakeholders, which is all five of us. Right? I don't have my name on it because I'm kind of putting it over here. But what we've been doing all along we we meet, we talk, we discuss, we come up with ideas, we put together plans, we determine what we wanna do, but there's also the external stakeholders, which we've been meeting with already. And we'll continue to meet with Everybody has their own ideas. Right? So what we wanna do is then we go through the product management which is what I will be facilitating. We haven't really gotten to this point yet where we have to have that call where we start looking at the ideas prioritizing them where you know, so we've got that list. I've mentioned it a couple times, but that's gonna be part of the whole process. K. So so you take all of these ideas and they go into the product funnel. Now notice know, we have a lot of arrows here that are bidirectional, go go both ways. So like I said, this bridge or product manager is responsible for the what and the why. And the engineers is how. Right? So we come up with our ideas, We narrow it down to the ideas that we want to do, and then the node figures out how to do those ideas. But the node doesn't work in a vacuum and neither do I. Right? So during this process he and I are in constant communication of going back and forth, you know, what's gonna change, what doesn't change. Etcetera. And everybody else is in the loop as well because once we have made one of those changes, right, we go back and we do feedback loops where we go through and say, is this what we want? Is this how it looks? You know, we we've kind of done that with a POC when I send out all of these videos, show you what's done. We have a call. We talk about it. Make some more changes. So it's it's a very circular process. It really doesn't end. Because once we have buy off and and everybody says, yep, two thumbs up, we're good to go. There's always more ideas in the hopper here. Right? So that's that's why I wanted to stress that we we we need to maintain that communication loop really to kinda to kinda maintain order and not go into chaos But one of the other, big reasons why we need to do it this way is for documentation. K? So everybody's got access to this. In the InnVestAI folder, there's a development folder. There, you'll find a folder called product. And this is where we have a lot of notes but this is the Bible. Right here. I'm just gonna put it plain and simply. This is the most important folder because this is where we have what's called the product requirement document, the PRD. This document gets into the minutiae, and is really an instruction manual for the engineers. We put together a detailed list right down to the button. Okay? You can have a button in this location location, the button is going to do this, or you can have a drop down list. So these nine or actually 10 PRDs, there's one down here that's not numbered. Are just for the AVM that we've done to this point so far. And to show you what's involved in this, let me go ahead and open this up. See what screen it pops up on. There we go. So I'm sharing the whole screen, so you should be able to see. Do you see the Word document in there? Is that a yes? Can you see the Word document? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:49:56.149Z)

Oh, we can see yeah. We can see the word document. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T21:49:57.444Z)

Wanna make sure I'm sharing the right thing. Alright. So this document is only pertaining to the valuation section. One tiny section of the AVM. In it, it gives a very brief overview and now we get into the requirements, so it talks about the metrics dashboard, which are those five cards on top, It gives you detail on all five of those, you know, what is the format, it's a percentage with one decimal place, everything else. And then we've got those four different tabs. The first tab is the acquisition tab. It describes what it is, and here's all the requirements, all the fields that are in there, how you input it. If there's any calculations, it'll give you the formulas, etcetera. And we also include screenshots and what this is, the idea is that the node can go over this with Raj or Shavam and this will be the instruction manual for creating the valuation section. If there are any changes made while we do this, it's very important to document So there again, if there's communication going all different directions between parties, we're gonna miss this. And to give you a real life example, when Red Eye Q was developed, it was developed by two partners, They were investors. They were frustrated with not being able to extract data and having a consolidated model, so they built it. But there again, they were not soft developers or product managers. So they did not document any of this. So fast forward, five years, Arcadia purchases this product, there's nobody on the team that was involved with the development of the product and every single time that you wanted to make a change, whether it's a new enhancement or fix a bug, they had to spend days, if not weeks, reverse engineering this tool so they knew how to how to to fix it right. So this is one of the also the big reasons. I I don't want this to come across as, I'm the gatekeeper, and I make all the decisions on the on the prioritization and everything like that. That that is definitely not the case. It's still a team effort, but there are reasons behind why we need to do this. So I just wanted to bring everybody up and and and and make sure we're all understanding of how the organization is supposed to work in in this type of environment. So does anybody have any questions, comments,

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:52:59.889Z)

No. And and this just to follow-up this, how would I talk about this briefly on Sunday after you know, the the three you know, you you and I and Howard, we all talked to I I was getting I was responding to Vinod's emails getting, you know, excited about the feedback and and the work that was coming out. But I I do agree with Howard. It's important to have the right pathway for all of this. Particularly just from my own experience because with with Hotel BIS is that I'm not a technology person, and my technology are not hotel people or real estate people. So having somebody that has a good the more that that bridge, you know, the the more somebody anyway has some knowledge of both, the better they can translate the, you know, the needs of the business into the you know, what's actually being built and avoid miscommunication. So so, yeah, that's that's that's just adding to to why it's important. But I think that we have been doing that. We just we just got with all the stuff being done, got got carried away with it Yeah. Over the weekend. So Yeah. Also, we are just getting start getting getting started

### You (2025-07-28T21:53:53.734Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. No. I I I appreciate that.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:54:08.069Z)

I think, you know. With kind of you know, start start having the right

### You (2025-07-28T21:54:11.084Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:54:13.859Z)

price set in place. Right now. I think it is important to kind of launch the product or develop the prod product at certain speed. For that, even if we don't have to follow every step, you know, we don't have to. It's I think we should

### You (2025-07-28T21:54:33.944Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:54:34.689Z)

focus more on delving at a good speed rather than following every, you know,

### You (2025-07-28T21:54:38.254Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I you know, don't don't get me wrong. We we're not looking to be

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:54:41.849Z)

procedure.

### You (2025-07-28T21:54:45.724Z)

rigid. Right? And, you know, we we need to be flexible, especially in the beginning. But at the same time we have to develop habits between the five of us because

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:54:58.349Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:54:59.984Z)

it's only five today. Could be 25 in six months. Right? And if we can't control the communication between this small group, we'll never be able to implement something like this down the road. So, you know, kind of at the same time planting the seed. For future growth. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:55:18.659Z)

Yeah. Definitely.

### You (2025-07-28T21:55:20.554Z)

yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:55:23.529Z)

Yeah. This is definitely helpful. But you'll most probably still see me sending

### You (2025-07-28T21:55:27.524Z)

Oh, yeah. No. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:55:28.659Z)

some emails or something here and there and reaching out to people.

### You (2025-07-28T21:55:29.984Z)

You know? And and you and I know we've been through this a thousand times.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:55:32.209Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:55:35.324Z)

The developers start developing, they may find something in this document that's either wrong or could be improved or might not be necessary at all So this is a living, breathing document. That will always be updated and maintained. So so, yeah, this is, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:55:58.009Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:55:58.204Z)

you know, I didn't come down the mountain with the stone tablets. Right? These these are definitely going to be changing.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:05.149Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:05.294Z)

At any time. So yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:08.999Z)

No. These are super helpful. We are working day in and day out. Or on weekends. You are not there. If we have to ask anything or

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:17.094Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:17.679Z)

look for some information, we can always reach out to these documents and, you know,

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:18.944Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:21.479Z)

get the information. We don't have to hunt anyone.

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:22.024Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:24.119Z)

So these are very helpful. Thank you all. I think when you look at the pot, when you look at the five of us and, like, where our natural skill sets lie. Right? Like, Mark and I are probably more I mean, we've comment on things, but Drew is the most technical of the three of us. And he has added so much value to the

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:44.864Z)

Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:46.079Z)

proof of concept because he is the one that takes it the most seriously about

### You (2025-07-28T21:56:46.814Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:56:51.049Z)

documenting our conversations and, like, getting in the weeds. And then, Howard, you've been great too. So it's kind of like between like, Mark and I sit on one side where we'll give feedback, but Drew is so much better at, like, really digging into the technical piece of it just like Howard, you are and Vinod, you are. So we kinda sit on a spectrum.

### You (2025-07-28T21:57:07.714Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:57:11.469Z)

Almost of does that make sense? Like yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T21:57:13.714Z)

Alright. Well, thank you. So, Vinod, do you wanna kind of

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:57:19.649Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T21:57:22.264Z)

get yeah. I was gonna say, do you do you wanna give an update?

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:57:23.669Z)

So where do we go from here? Yeah. Yeah. From here, I can yeah. It's been super productive one week. So we have download the login page. We have developed the functionality to upload the documents. We have also kind of hosted a AI model which is pretrained by Microsoft. I was sharing it with Howard earlier. It is called layout l m. It has got a lot of capabilities. So it'll work on document text extraction as well as it can create the overview of the document, summarize the document, and you can kind of have the conversation with the model directly. You can ask the questions related to the document as well. So this is all in motion right now. Nothing finalized. I cannot literally demo you right away. But there's lot of progress these three areas. I'm focusing more on, expects part right now because that's where we're gonna get the, data. Need the data first before we can develop any more pages. So, yeah, a lot of progress on the extraction part, particularly the model is hosted We are able to trigger the model wherein it process the document. It's not there 100%. We are trying to fine tune it. And I think we should be in good shape in some time. As soon as it is up, I'm gonna send you all update and we can probably hop on a call or do a quick demo.

### You (2025-07-28T21:58:55.724Z)

Yeah. That's that's that's Yeah. Alright. That's fantastic. And and that kind of

### Guest (2025-07-28T21:58:59.049Z)

So, yeah, not a problem.

### You (2025-07-28T21:59:00.374Z)

is a segue also. I don't know if everybody had a chance to look through the document that I sent out last night. But what the node and the team are working on is the first baby step toward much more automation in the process what we have today. So so what I sent out last night was just a comparison of what was in the CBREOM. Versus the data that we have in the ABM and what the users would input and there's a tremendous amount of data in the OM's or b o v's, whichever term you wanna use. That with a tool like what Vinod is working on, you can just scan that PDF pick up that data, and map it to the AVM so that the users don't have to input the name and the address and and the comps and all these other things that were on that PowerPoint. That I sent out. The thing is it's not a 100% accurate. You know, we're the the top the the technology isn't up to that point yet. It's it is very accurate. But that if we were to go out too soon and we have errors in the mapping, we lose credibility. So there's gonna be a lot of implementation baby steps, testing and testing, and then we'll test once again. Making sure that we can get that in there. So ideally, we could potentially get to the point now I know not all o m's include the historical financials like the CBRE did, but if they do, as well as the pro form a that was in there, I mean, almost the entire model could be pre populated and the users would not have to go and input all this information They would just have to go and tweak it to to to meet their investment criteria. Lot easier to change 10 or 20 cells than they have to input a 100. Right? So that's kind of the the goal behind everything. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:01:18.819Z)

And by by the way, Howard, e even if they don't have the historicals in the OM, typically, the broker would send out, a data room, and the data room would have the historical

### You (2025-07-28T22:01:25.694Z)

Right. Yes. Yeah. It it's always available. I I was

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:01:29.689Z)

So it's always available.

### You (2025-07-28T22:01:30.664Z)

I was just saying if we if if if was in one document, right,

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:01:31.059Z)

Just a question of whether exactly it's not Right.

### You (2025-07-28T22:01:34.164Z)

wouldn't that be the perfect world where you just upload one PDF and boom, you've got the AVM populated. But yeah. And and it really have it in two or three different documents, all you're talking about is a how long is it gonna take me to drag and drop it onto the screen. Right? So it's still you know, a thousand times better than what it what it is manually. Yeah. And that's something they're not gonna get in Excel. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:02:03.539Z)

Yeah. The model we have we are using, right, it can

### You (2025-07-28T22:02:06.684Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:02:07.099Z)

expect data from video, from Excel file, CSV, as well as from the image tool. So let's see. I'm hoping

### You (2025-07-28T22:02:14.374Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:02:16.059Z)

it's gonna work out great.

### You (2025-07-28T22:02:18.554Z)

Very exciting stuff. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:02:21.889Z)

Okay. And then if we do need, like, an all hands on team call, we just should probably get our doctor in a row around time zones because we cross like, a gazillion time zones between Drew Pacific and then the Indian time zone, which Howard was telling me is actually on, like, a half hour. So if we ever do need to do an all hands on call, it's probably gonna be sorry, Drew, but early West Coast, and then it's gonna be very, very late for the for the offshore team. Right? And for the rest of us, it'll be somewhere midday. Yeah. Offshore team has been, like, working so hard. I could see one of the engineers committing the code just one hour ago. So I'm like, okay.

### You (2025-07-28T22:03:09.554Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We don't always need both, but

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:03:11.519Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T22:03:12.834Z)

yeah. Right now, it's 03:30 in the morning and and in their time zone. So, you it's probably wouldn't want to get keep them up that late. But I I was telling Diane that we always made an effort on the RedIQ team to make sure calls were wrapped up by eleven or 11:30 eastern time at the very latest, which put it about 09:00, in New Delhi. Or nine nine I'm sorry. In Hyderabad where they were located. So true that'd be what maybe

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:03:49.509Z)

Yeah. Same same time, John.

### You (2025-07-28T22:03:51.954Z)

07:30 or 08:30AM

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:03:58.579Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess 11:30 would be, like, yeah, 08:30. I can usually

### You (2025-07-28T22:04:00.664Z)

Yeah. But this is rare. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:04:04.649Z)

make that.

### You (2025-07-28T22:04:05.494Z)

most of the I mean, the communication between us and the developers is gonna go through the node. Right? They're be even it's not like we're gonna have a weekly call with them. Right? This is yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:04:18.029Z)

Yeah. It would be great if we could call them for

### You (2025-07-28T22:04:18.274Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:04:21.589Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-28T22:04:21.944Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:04:22.509Z)

introduce to everyone in one call. Yeah. We can do that on Fridays. Sometime. Yeah. Do you guys wanna do it this Friday more this Friday morning work? Yeah. This Friday should be great. So exactly what Drew, how early can you do call your time and still make it be, like, know, not middle of the night. So if Drew can say 09:00, that is our

### You (2025-07-28T22:04:52.514Z)

That would be 10:00PM their time or twelve would be 09:30.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:04:53.449Z)

twelve. That's their Yeah. I could always do 09:00 pretty much. You know? Okay. 09:00 is our twelve. Right?

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:09.764Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:11.949Z)

That's that's the 09:30, I believe.

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:13.634Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:14.779Z)

So, yeah, I think they should be good with that.

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:16.594Z)

If you guys want, you can always add another time zone to whatever

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:17.759Z)

Take

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:19.824Z)

calendar you're using, and I think it's at least in Microsoft Teams, it comes up as, there's a list of it. Mumbai, New Delhi, are all included in that time zone. Makes it way easier to to know what time it is than to do the math in your head.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:36.569Z)

Okay. Okay. So does that work? New Eastern for all the people that are on East Coast time?

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:41.804Z)

Yes. Does for me.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:51.259Z)

And, Mark, does that work for you too? Yeah. It should be good.

### You (2025-07-28T22:05:52.384Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:05:54.749Z)

Okay. And should we do that instead of the Thursday at 05:30 call since they're I mean, it's literally, like, the night before the morning. Does that make sense? Like, if we could talk on Thursday at 05:30, we're just gonna get back on the phone the next morning, or should we keep the Thursday call because it's just the five of us? Well, I mean, is is the call on Friday simply to just sort of introduce ourselves to the team and meet them? I I mean, to do we want them to you know, do we wanna do the whole involved call with them, or we really just sort of saying hello and just

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:25.244Z)

I'm yeah. Would say it's 09:30 o'clock at night. They probably don't wanna sit and listen to us talk about the

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:27.789Z)

you know, what's the goal?

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:31.924Z)

signing of the LLCs and things like that. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:34.809Z)

Okay. Yeah. You got it. Alright.

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:36.294Z)

Let's probably keep keep probably keep both.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:38.429Z)

Not really relevant. Alright. So 05:30, we stick with on Thursday.

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:38.794Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:41.839Z)

Okay. Good. Good. Good. And then we're on with Ellen tomorrow. That is

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:46.504Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:48.119Z)

good. We do have a I think we do have an hour blocked, but we

### You (2025-07-28T22:06:50.704Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:06:51.139Z)

can do it in a half hour if she wants to do it in an expedited format. Yeah. Well, thank you, Mark. Knowing Ellen, she'll have a lot of questions. Okay. But, yeah, we should try to give it to a half an hour in terms

### You (2025-07-28T22:07:04.104Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:07:04.149Z)

of I think just and, if, you know, when you're in my experience, least, you lose people after thirty minutes. Okay. Alright. And We have our we have our call our 11:30 call. Can we push that to twelve? Because I have another call at eleven. Or could actually, could we push it to 12:30? Does that work tomorrow? That's the business development call. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And that's just the hotel people where we're talking through all of our friends and family and stuff like that. So that's fine with me. Drew, does that work for you? What what time did you wanna move it back an hour, you said? Till 12:30. Yeah. Yeah. I I can do half an hour at that point. Actually, we're just pushing it back. It it was scheduled for it was scheduled for twelve. I think we're just pushing it 12:30. Okay. So 12:30 for half hour. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. K. Alright. That's good. Progress, everyone. It's exciting. Yes. I know we wanted to did we wanna talk about the landing pages at all? I mean, that or or do it cannot be pushed another you know, to it to Thursday or Landing page, meaning the landing page of the software or the website? Software. Software. Yeah. We could This here. These pages that Vinod sent out yes, over the weekend. Yeah. Let's definitely do that. And and I don't know how much so there's two options. Here. This is one. And right And then this this is the other. So my I mean, I guess, Vinod, what and Howard, what level of what level and type of feedback is useful here? See, I sent it to everyone because like, you guys understand what is useful to the user. Right? What would Mhmm. The user value? Right? Based on that feedback, probably we could cherry pick from each of the design. I'll probably add something more. And decide how the, you know, the first impression of our app should be useful to the user. So is this this is the first page they would receive when they log on?

### You (2025-07-28T22:09:41.374Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:09:41.589Z)

When they log in. Yeah. Meaning, it could be. It could be. Yeah. It's Yeah. I mean, when when just sort of global comment I had was that it just the print is very small. I mean, it will fit on the entire screen right now because you are seeing on

### You (2025-07-28T22:09:57.854Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:09:58.669Z)

seeing it as a image. So it looks smaller. It would be bigger. Would be bigger. Right. But could I mean, is this gonna be on mobile as if they log on in their phone or their handheld device? Yeah. They can use either mobile, but this design is for the laptop or computer. Yeah. It'd be a separate design for mobile. Okay. And then do we think that people are gonna wanna see their whole portfolio upfront, or are they gonna maybe wanna just focus on a

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:25.254Z)

Yeah. Let me

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:28.039Z)

specific investment? And then maybe there's a screen that allows them to toggle to the portfolio.

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:29.944Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:33.439Z)

But if they're focused on one deal, they may wanna just be able to zero in and just, like, do a quick something and then

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:39.854Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:40.659Z)

not look at

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:41.614Z)

Let let let let me comment on that.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:42.209Z)

their whole portfolio. And we'll have the navigation We'll kind of have the navigation for that. I think there's

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:50.284Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:50.499Z)

some deal details here

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:51.664Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:53.549Z)

well. So if they want to jump to one of the space big deal, they can kind of click on these

### You (2025-07-28T22:10:56.444Z)

the node Diane and I were talking this morning, and and

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:10:59.819Z)

particular deals.

### You (2025-07-28T22:11:00.954Z)

couple of thoughts so so, Mark, just to be clear, this is where the users or the clients log in, their first page, not not the website, obviously. But the so so the pipeline

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:11:15.669Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T22:11:16.234Z)

or the list of all their deals should be front and center here because that's where they're going. You'll log in, and then you either continue with work on an existing deal or you create a new deal. But you do wanna have some of these metrics, but even though there's a there's another issue, remember that their pipeline continues to grow and grow. Right? They they they could have deals in their pipeline that they added five years ago. And so when it comes to some of these metrics, we're gonna have to be very, very careful.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:11:57.549Z)

But but just why do they I mean, if they're looking at one deal and they're

### You (2025-07-28T22:11:59.114Z)

Well, you you when you log in to the landing page,

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:12:01.589Z)

on one deal. Why do they care about their whole portfolio?

### You (2025-07-28T22:12:04.084Z)

this is where all of your deals are listed. Right? It

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:12:10.439Z)

Alright. I get that.

### You (2025-07-28T22:12:10.454Z)

Yeah. Yeah. But that that's what I'm saying is, yeah, why would they care? I mean and and you don't want to include your IRR or ROI on a deal that was underwritten five years ago. Now if you're an if you're an asset manager, and you're keeping these deals up to date, that's one thing. But why we have to be careful because we have such a wide range of users that none of this is gonna fit all all of them. Right? So the node one of the things we might wanna think about is a create your own dashboard. Right? We can create widgets. And let them choose what they wanna have. One option. Another thing would be you know, to use some of the data that we have. What are the hot markets? What are the the things we can do there? But but try to keep it as clean as possible. And then they can do whatever they need to do. They wanna go back and work on an old on a deal that's currently being worked on, they can then click on that and go into the AVM which is the POC that I've been working on or can click the button to create a brand new deal whatever they wanna do. Does that make sense?

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:13:29.209Z)

Yeah. But, again, I I think we should again, I I respectfully am Like, again, it just may be too much information. Like, if if you were dealing with someone that has a portfolio of 30 hotels, comprised of five different funds,

### You (2025-07-28T22:13:44.794Z)

Right. No. No. We we're we're in agreement on that. That that's

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:13:46.529Z)

Like, this was maybe too much

### You (2025-07-28T22:13:49.134Z)

kinda what I was trying to express as well. You know? There's just too many too many items on here.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:13:49.499Z)

information. And also word this product, the user journey right, we're going after it initially from a capital markets perspective. So the landing page might wanna look a lot like what deal paths landing page looks like, which is probably if I if I've seen it right, it's more like okay. I have 30 deals in my pipeline. I'm Access Financial. Right? And at the current moment, I'm underwriting 30 active deals. And so my pipeline is the first thing I see is my landing page, and I can kind of check, okay, what's the most you know, who's finished what underwriting, what's the status of all my deals, and then from there, drill down into any particular deal so you can start to get into the the the deal metrics. So almost like the I I kinda think that maybe we should all go study, like, what deal pass landing page looks like or deal cloud because I think the landing page is more like

### You (2025-07-28T22:14:55.214Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:14:56.419Z)

the the pipeline page, which again and then when deals die, they they are no longer actively on your pipeline, but they're still sitting in the background. Right? So that if you ever need to go get it

### You (2025-07-28T22:15:08.504Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:15:09.649Z)

for whatever reason, you can pull your dead deals and see them. Does that make sense? I think what Howard said makes most sense where where the user can sort of format what they want their home page to be. Right? Because if I'm Ellen Brown, for example, and I've got 10 clients and I'm asset managing, you know, 20 hotels for 10 clients, I mean, when she comes up on here,

### You (2025-07-28T22:15:31.644Z)

Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:15:33.229Z)

you know, seeing 20 deals for 10 different clients is not gonna be helpful for her. She just wants to see you know, the canoe in in in Hampton Bays. Which is one of her hotels. Right? And she doesn't wanna see anything else

### You (2025-07-28T22:15:47.374Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:15:47.529Z)

her portfolio. Right? Because on that given hour, all she cares about is that one asset. Mhmm. So I just think that we have to that we have to we we should think about if a user can just decide exactly what they want on this

### You (2025-07-28T22:15:59.164Z)

Yeah. They they they there is a there is a a grouping and a filter button at the top that

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:16:01.919Z)

this first page. Right. Because it's a landing go ahead.

### You (2025-07-28T22:16:04.854Z)

that the node has there. Right? So you could filter some of the data there, but I think what might be nice is you can create specific filters for specific groups. Right? I could create a group a and here's the properties in group a. B, etcetera. So you could control to some extent what is viewed using that type, you know, you if you can create a filter, name it, and save it, It just depends on how much time and effort we wanna push put into this.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:16:41.989Z)

Basically, like like, somebody like

### You (2025-07-28T22:16:43.524Z)

Right off the bat. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:16:44.929Z)

It's a Yeah. We could even you could probably even set, like, if each property is gonna have, like, I mean, at the you could even do it at the time of creation of a deal. Right? It's gonna have a lead you know, acquisitions person, a lead analyst. Then if or in something is gonna be when they when it becomes an owned asset, like a something that goes kinda goes over to asset management, you could have the lead asset manager and an analyst and you could opt to have the system just filter

### You (2025-07-28T22:17:14.174Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:17:16.579Z)

You know, if you you're the user, if I'm Drew Wallace and I log in, it just filters out

### You (2025-07-28T22:17:17.384Z)

Yes. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:17:20.649Z)

everything else and just shows me the stuff that's assigned to me. That's another way to go about it. But I think so I think that know, maybe Mark to some extent, addresses what you're talking about. That way, Ellen could just send it to like, I just wanna see the stuff that's relevant to me, I just filter out everything else by default. Yeah. And, again, I think people are gonna want to be able to just sort of see one hotel without all the other noise. It's just you know Well, they and they will. They they will if they click on anyone. Like, I'm assuming if you click on one of the hotels, it'll take you to that hotel. But if, you know, Ellen has seven or eight hotels, and and I she's gonna have I would assume wanna have those

### You (2025-07-28T22:17:57.194Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:17:58.029Z)

seven or eight hotels listed in some way that she can easily select them. Yeah. My my and my I mean, yeah, my thought is that this these having the deal pipeline like this maybe with a way different you could view it as a map. You could view it as

### You (2025-07-28T22:18:11.914Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:18:14.759Z)

these are pictures. You could view it as a list, whatever it is, the however it is you wanna view it. That's a widget of sorts These are mean, Howard, this is what you're talking about, like, having widgets that a user can kinda opt into

### You (2025-07-28T22:18:25.154Z)

I mean, there there are some products out there where there's there's a page, like, build your own dashboard. Right? And you can choose from the widgets that are already there. So if you want an IRR widget, you just drag it onto the screen. You can even put it you know, where in the road do you want it. You can reorder them. That's definitely not a version one. Right? That's that's gonna be later. But, you know, this is don't get me wrong. This is not a bad dashboard.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:18:49.179Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T22:18:53.304Z)

So if you if you go back down to or up to here, so you know, like those widget cards, you don't want to mix and match different property types. Right? You don't want a motel six with a all inclusive resort included in your IRR calculations or anything else. Right? So I think if we made the filtering easier, or more visible, you know, we can accomplish exactly what we're talking about. It's just a matter, you know, it's how are we gonna do it? What's the best way to to get this set up? Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:19:32.049Z)

Yeah. For the MVP version, probably what Diane was saying

### You (2025-07-28T22:19:35.664Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:19:37.569Z)

the similar to

### You (2025-07-28T22:19:38.724Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:19:39.589Z)

the deal pipeline. Right? So which will basically list out all the deals people have in a tablet format, and then there will be different filters

### You (2025-07-28T22:19:46.804Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:19:48.889Z)

and, you know, they can search the deals, pay apply the filter page on that.

### You (2025-07-28T22:19:50.834Z)

This yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:19:53.259Z)

Once you know, someone clicks on one particular photo. Because I the the users are very you know, they have very different goals. Right? So if if we're dealing with a fund manager, then he or she is gonna be concerned about the IRR and the multiple and their cash on cash. If we're dealing with an asset manager,

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:12.474Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:12.559Z)

he or she may be focused just on actual versus budget and, you know, how the hotels are performing compared to their comp set and

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:17.854Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:19.939Z)

so different users are gonna have different reasons to use this tool.

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:23.734Z)

And and and that's a good point.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:24.959Z)

So, again, I get that this is a

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:25.954Z)

Yeah. I'd

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:27.549Z)

evolving process, but we should think about how

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:30.114Z)

yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:31.439Z)

users can sort of custom create. You know, like, if you go on Expedia, right, you could pick on

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:34.394Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:36.079Z)

five star, four star, or three star hotels, then you could pick on resorts, then you could pick, you know, hotels that have a spa. Then you could pick hotels that have babysitting, and then you could, you know, you get very granular. In terms of how to program your application. And I think ultimately, as we get into future versions, we should just think about how to

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:54.894Z)

Yeah. I think this is a perfect example of

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:20:56.439Z)

scale to that point.

### You (2025-07-28T22:20:59.084Z)

where we need to have the users tell us what they want. You know, we can go to the AVM and version one like like Diane mentioned, the pipeline. Let's keep it simple. Let's not worry about the the metric cards yet. But as we talk to our prospective clients, our clients in all the different personas that we're gonna be dealing with. Let's let's what what do you want? What is important to you to see and go from there? Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:21:28.549Z)

No. That's fine. But, again, I mean, I'm

### You (2025-07-28T22:21:30.104Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:21:31.049Z)

I am a client in theory. Right? Because I I do this.

### You (2025-07-28T22:21:31.674Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:21:35.179Z)

I'm just sort of putting on my lens of of, you know, my user lens.

### You (2025-07-28T22:21:36.104Z)

No. I agree. I yeah. I understand. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:21:39.119Z)

But, but I hear you. But, I mean, maybe what we need to think about is for people who are underwriting, and that could be an acquisition person, it could be a lender, it could be a broker, it could be an appraiser. Right? They they probably need to see more, like, the their pipeline and then drill into their underwriting. But for the asset managers out there, maybe they do have a a different like, it it's a different persona. Right? And so I'm sure when we get to building our our website, we're gonna have drop downs that say you're an you know, your you're an owner or you're an acquisition per you know, acquisition team, you're a lender, you're an appraiser, you're an asset manager, you're portfolio manager. But maybe for the launch, we do have it, like, more for one for, like, in like, underwriting people and then one landing page for more asset managers. Would it be hard to have two Does that does that make sense for the initial

### You (2025-07-28T22:22:34.894Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:22:44.249Z)

we call this a POC or an MVP, whatever we're calling it now, mean, that depends upon what what features are we providing them. Is it just

### You (2025-07-28T22:22:53.074Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:22:53.149Z)

similar

### You (2025-07-28T22:22:54.604Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:22:55.669Z)

I was gonna say it could just be a toggle. Like, if you show the same thing, this like, what you have here, this these are

### You (2025-07-28T22:23:01.674Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:23:01.749Z)

images. You know? What do you call these?

### You (2025-07-28T22:23:03.314Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:23:04.419Z)

Thumbnails of, right, like, each of the properties, which could could easily be a tabular list. Then really, I I think that's at the highest level, that's the dividing line. Right? Like, is something in your pipeline, or is it part of your portfolio? And the users looking at pipeline, or they're gonna look at portfolio, and they may go back and forth. But but know, do you own it or not? Is a very is the high to me, the highest you know, level of dividing line about what what someone's gonna wanna look at as far as the list Yeah. But I I think it's it's even simpler, and I think what Diane said is is kind of what I was thinking. It's like every know, there's gonna be four or five different kinds of users for this as we've all been discussing for the past few months. And I think each of those types of investors are gonna wanna see different kinds of information presented differently. Right? So if I'm a lender, I have a certain number of things that I'm looking for. If I'm an asset manager, I've got 10 things that I wanna see. If I'm an acquisitions person, I've got 10 things that I wanna see. If I'm manager, right, and and we kinda know what those are. But they all have different goals and the different uses for this product. To to the extent possible, I I think what what we should try to do here is to set the framework Like, all of the things that fill into the framework may be slightly different. But trying to have I mean, Howard, correct me if I'm wrong here, but you know, the more different versions of the of something we create, the harder it is to manage. If we have one version of something, that's much easier to manage and scale to different customers and whatnot and and even different user types Right? But you but having the underlying framework and structure is is what we she knows again. So, like, if we were to pick this first one here, the framework is you know, something up here. These portfolio KPIs. Pipeline list and then, you know, and that's it. And then, you know, the pipeline list could be active. It could be portfolio. It could be whatever. The metrics could probably be switched out depending on your user type. To at least have the underlying framework is what we should try to do first. Howard, no. Does that what we say for some of these demos? Is just that this is kind of a macro version of all the things that this product can do. But we would envision in future versions to be able to customize this so that know, the user could actually

### You (2025-07-28T22:25:26.264Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:25:27.579Z)

select what data is most important for them. Right? So we just tell her upfront tomorrow this is just sort of more of a generic version of everything that we can do But that, you know, with future versions, whether it's version four or five or six, whatever it may be,

### You (2025-07-28T22:25:40.664Z)

Yeah. You're exactly right. That's that's

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:25:41.019Z)

you can custom create your own data presentation Is that a fair compromise?

### You (2025-07-28T22:25:45.244Z)

what what we need to do.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:25:46.989Z)

Yeah. But maybe we should just offer that up tomorrow as part of your you know, just so that she doesn't have to ask

### You (2025-07-28T22:25:53.104Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:25:55.019Z)

you know, because I I'm sure that'll be running through her her head. Yeah. And I work for tomorrow. For and for for settling because I the node I'm guessing, needs to or maybe doesn't need to need to have something to to finalize. At this point, or is it can his Yeah. Was just thinking probably I'll go with what Diane was saying. A deal pipeline page. And then if you say that it is very important to kind of show the different things for different users, If you could send me, like, what is important for these different kind of users,

### You (2025-07-28T22:26:26.174Z)

Yeah. For node, one thing I think we

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:26:29.579Z)

probably I can think through and then see, you know, what could be designed.

### You (2025-07-28T22:26:32.424Z)

we need to have in this type of a layout is the ability to for the chew users to choose between a card layout or a table layout. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:26:44.679Z)

Yeah. Yep. Yep. That's

### You (2025-07-28T22:26:48.384Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That's yeah. That's that's a pretty basic

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:26:49.589Z)

oh, yeah. That we can definitely do, and that's

### You (2025-07-28T22:26:51.764Z)

functionality. So even if we had something like that to show

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:26:52.679Z)

definitely useful. So

### You (2025-07-28T22:26:56.194Z)

know, that we're taking into account these different scenarios that you can do this I mean, it'll it'll show the users that we're definitely putting the effort into

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:27:08.419Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I just something. I'm so glad. No. Go ahead, Bernard. No. I was just saying, I think Mark kind of was just pointing out that how it is important for different users. If Mark, if you could, you know, probably summarize that in an email, that, you know, I might pick that in fix that up in the future as well. Not just in the MVP version, but that will be somewhere for use sometime down the line.

### You (2025-07-28T22:27:32.854Z)

Yeah. And and to sorry. Go ahead, Mark.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:27:36.939Z)

Alright. I I kind of the other No. I said, like, I'll try to put together a matrix

### You (2025-07-28T22:27:42.324Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:27:43.589Z)

of different types of users and what I think that they may wanna see.

### You (2025-07-28T22:27:44.234Z)

Yeah. Well, we've got the persona list. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:27:46.739Z)

Yeah. That would be great. Thank you. Sure.

### You (2025-07-28T22:27:47.394Z)

yeah, we've got the list of users. Let's yeah. I I think we can probably use that as well. It should actually be part of that documentation. And to Drew's point, any way that we want to filter or group these properties, we will need to include that in the property details modal. Right? There's already a drop down list that you choose whether it's select service, you know, convention, resort, whatever. There's other things that we'll need to do as well. In there. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:24.349Z)

And Drew made another really good point, which is at the highest, highest, highest level before we even get into the personas. The big difference is, are you underwriting it?

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:34.474Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:36.569Z)

Or do you own it? Right? Are you underwriting it and has it closed and now you own it? Or maybe for

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:37.974Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:42.589Z)

certain groups, you already own it. But that just that is probably the very, very highest level, like, a distinction that

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:49.784Z)

Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:50.039Z)

somehow should get captured, in the data so that it can be filtered.

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:52.024Z)

right. And the only way we can do that is if that field exists.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:55.119Z)

Based on yep.

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:55.704Z)

In the deal itself. And so we have to figure out, you know, what

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:28:56.329Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T22:28:59.854Z)

pop what are the potential combinations and then where would that be within the AVM Some of it most likely will just be right in the property details. When they fill that in. We can have drop down lists,

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:12.359Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:15.184Z)

Go from there. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:19.089Z)

Yes. Also, we are onboarding the user on the app, I think we should

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:20.944Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:24.059Z)

kind of give give them an option to select whether they are underwrite or

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:24.924Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:27.939Z)

owner, broker.

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:28.114Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:30.109Z)

So, you know, we'll have the user information. And based on that, we can filter out certain

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:31.944Z)

the node let's let's think about this because remember at red eye

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:34.989Z)

information.

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:35.684Z)

we tried to incorporate when in the user level, you know, when we were creating a user, you'd get their name, email address, then we also had a drop down list for role. And so we had

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:29:50.229Z)

You're right.

### You (2025-07-28T22:29:50.944Z)

CEO, president, asset manager, business analyst, you know, all the different roles that we thought we could. And against my vehement objections, they also included other. Guess which was the most popular role. Right? Nobody wanted to tell what they did, so everybody was

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:30:12.609Z)

Mhmm. That makes

### You (2025-07-28T22:30:15.314Z)

other. But, yeah, I mean, if we did we we could do something like that. Just

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:30:18.349Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T22:30:19.264Z)

I'm I'm begging right now in advance. Do not include other. But but, yeah, that's that's the way we could probably do it is at the user level that they would have their particular role. And so that when they log in, they don't have to choose anything. They don't have to make a choice. It's already made for them.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:30:44.249Z)

And I'll mention this as we're kind of talking through this DealPath does have a lot of videos on YouTube as well. So So it can be helpful to, like, just watch a two minute video of what their

### You (2025-07-28T22:30:52.954Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:30:57.419Z)

landing page looks like and their filter. Not that we wanna duplicate it exactly, but they've all we're kind of following a yellow brick road here. Right? And they've already done a lot of good work on how to present it and how to filter it. So we can get a lot of ideas as a as a team. And then, you know, Howard, you, and Vinod can work

### You (2025-07-28T22:31:14.694Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:31:16.719Z)

through how to document it and then how to build it out. It's good. Okay. One other question. In terms of our website and landing page, do we have a plan for that? So right now, we do have one website which is run up and running. I don't know whether you have had a chance to look at that, but I can send the URL here. When I was on call? Same. Investai.com. Oh, because I just tried that. I couldn't find it. Alright. Here. I'll send you that link here in the meeting chat. So this is running on code ID and, you know, it's kind of using some template. Planning to move that to our infrastructure sometime soon.

### You (2025-07-28T22:32:05.294Z)

So, Diane,

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:32:06.129Z)

### You (2025-07-28T22:32:42.184Z)

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:32:45.699Z)

website. So if you have any ideas, please. Send them across.

### You (2025-07-28T22:32:53.414Z)

two aliases under Diane's account, one called sales@investai.com, and another one info@InvestAI.com. So if anybody sends an email to either those email addresses, it'll end up in Diane's inbox.

### Guest (2025-07-28T22:33:14.329Z)
