# Transcript for: Book a Meeting with Jean (Howard Berends)

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:02:16.433Z)

Hi. Everyone.

### You (2026-01-27T18:02:17.074Z)

How are you?

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:02:19.553Z)

Doing very good. On you.

### You (2026-01-27T18:02:20.834Z)

Doing? My best to stay warm.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:02:27.553Z)

Must be pretty cold on your side.

### You (2026-01-27T18:02:31.714Z)

This has actually been one of the hardest winters we've had in a lot. We. Were dining negative 20. A couple days ago. And single digits since. But when you go outside and it's minus 20, and then today you go outside and it's plus 50, and it actually feels kind of warm.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:02:59.233Z)

It's almost too hot.

### You (2026-01-27T18:02:59.794Z)

Yeah. So.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:03:04.433Z)

Yeah. Good. We didn't have the storm. So good on my side. Thanks. For the note that you sent me to you had with the ex CFO of Belt Partners.

### You (2026-01-27T18:03:27.794Z)

Good feedback there.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:03:30.353Z)

Yeah. Obviously. Of course. Not surprising to me because that's the kind of things I heard from.

### You (2026-01-27T18:03:36.754Z)

's.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:03:42.433Z)

Different people having similar position, different size of property management. So this one values by one of the largest. 20, top 10 or top 20? As the largest property manager in the US it's interesting to see that. The same problem is really across the board. So it goes from thousand dollars all the way. To million dollars, probably. And then whenever. I would still expect that the large one, they have some kind of solution, which actually they do. But in that example, it's really something that was custom made and a mix of different solutions. A good feedback. It's a good surprise that it was not surprising.

### You (2026-01-27T18:04:48.274Z)

Well, I'm not going to lie. I wasn't quite sure. What the prospects were with the large companies. I always felt comfortable with the small and mid sized companies and thinking that, yeah, I think that's a good opportunity. But to hear his comments about those Yari and Real Page and how dissatisfied they were. I don't know if the words captured. He had mentioned that he was kind of working with some other CFOs. And trying to see what they've been doing. So I don't think he was speaking just on his own. I think he was really kind of summing up some of the conversations that he was having with some other people that he's worked with. Some of his peers, so that was very encouraging.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:05:42.753Z)

Okay? Yeah. The objective. It's a good surprise that it's not surprising, but the objective. Was, but primary objective was mostly for you to hear from. People feel the pain, that it's a real pain, so you can really understand. And better measure. What we want to do or the solution that we want to build. And it's been evolving. Quite a lot over the past two years that since I had that kind of discussion with property manager and financial people in property management company for almost five years since I started working with property manager. So I was really providing payment services. But I was always curious about okay. But the first thing I wanted to understand, in fact, was. How do you measure the value or the benefit of. Payment digitization because five years ago 70% of payment were still check. It's been evolving quite a lot. But still the data I don't know, but it's really around maybe 30 to 30% of people who are still getting a check every month to pay their rent. But we trying to understand how property manager we are measuring the value of having that resident paying via digital options or ACH credit debit card. And the best way to measure that is, of course, the impact on your cash flow. Because you expect that if you are paid with sch, then you get paid on your account and you receive the payment today, or if it's same day ch or the day after. But then we need to check. Then it takes time. Then check might be insufficient fund. So that's the genesis of my discussion here with property manager. Measure the value and there is nothing better than the impact on the cash flow. And then it led to wild. But by the way, do we have. How do you do that? Do you have any automation? I heard the same kind of feedback about all the top five pms, the MRI and so on about the same problem that they don't really have a solution that is well designed for managing the cash. So this is the idea of the problem that I have made here for quite a long time and evolve in terms of how to desire to solve the problem all the way to now, where I think it's more mature. Well, for me. It's a combination of the time now, really, to focus on that. I think AI. Help as well, to see that we can approach that in more innovative way. And not just building automation, but going one step beyond. And this is where there is actually a lot of unknown as well, is where AI is going to take us or how fast it's going to take us. That's been a no. It's a mix of. It's a very exciting time, but. It's a time where we have much less visibility when we build technology. And in the sense that what we build now, we don't know if it's not going to be obsolete in six months. Before. When we build technology, you have visibility that, okay, there is nothing that there is no revolution or nothing that's going to change dramatically the way we build technology and people leverage technology over the next year, two years, three years, even more than that, now it's completely different. So that's where the biggest opportunities, really one of the biggest uncertainty. But what we meant is still the problem. The problem that I heard five years ago is still there. And there is no one who tackled that problem. Even though there are a lot of treasury management platform on the market, there is no treasury management platform that is really addressing that problem. For property manager, it has to be.

### You (2026-01-27T18:10:40.754Z)

Cat.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:10:46.593Z)

So that's where we are now and why we want to continue that venture with my tour Circle funder. I don't know if you have any question, by the way, at this stage.

### You (2026-01-27T18:11:02.914Z)

No, I think a couple things. The conversation with what Steve went really well. I think we hit it off. I don't know what kind of feedback you got, but I was really impressed. And as far as the AI. Portion is, I think. It'll definitely help build the tool. Faster. Even with the POC out there quicker and start getting tests. But where I see AI fit into this puzzle? Is in the actual analysis portion of. A particular company's cash position. You're still going to need integrations. So you can't use API to estimate. Anything. You still have to have that one to one integration with the financials. As well as the property operating. Information. Now, you could use AI to extrapolate forward, perhaps some of that operating information, seasonality, what else is happening in the market? Anything that they should be aware of. But like the other company that I was helping out, where AI Was really primarily. For once they ingest all of this hotel investment in underwriting data. The question becomes, how can I increase my roi? Or what do I need to tweak in order to. Meet my investment criteria. Spreadsheet or come in and change this assumption or change that. Whereas AI has the ability to look at the big picture and say, well, yeah, we can tweak this or this, that, and it'll come up with suggestions. And I see the same thing happening here. So if I'm your controller or the cfo, and I've got all of these different data points. In front of me. Than what I see AI helping. Is. Ask the question. I need X dollars on the list, particular date. How can I? Make it happen. And that's something where AI can come in as well. It's obviously not the only case, but. Using AI as a tool. Is really. Where it's at. There's been a lot of. People pushing back. That AI is. All intelligent, all knowing thing that everybody thinks it is. It's just another tool of the toolbox. And I think that's probably in this particular situation. Where? The value will really come is. To. Be able. AI doesn't really. Good job. Of surfacing things that you don't catch right away. In capturing edge cases, I found that it just comes up with things. I never thought about that. And even as a product ranger, when I'm creating PRDs and requirement documents and it comes up with these edge cases, it's like, wow, nobody's thought about that. And that's really good. And I think that's really kind of what we need to only control the sun. That type of situation.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:14:48.993Z)

Yeah, I completely agree. That's where two different aspect with the eye, it's the AI. How do we leverage AI as a technology embedded in a platform? That's what is exposed and visible to the customer. And there is AI as a tool. As a development tool. So that's more internal. That helps to develop faster technology. Where we. When I was trying to do some estimate almost two years ago, about. Okay, if we were to develop a platform and this cup was slightly different, was a bit larger, actually. Larger and to some extent because I was considering. Payment as well. Collecting payment, but not as deep in term of. Cash flow management. But, yeah, my estimate was we need a team of 15 people. Or maybe to start was a bit less, was seven to eight people for six months to build mvp. Now we operate down to two people for two months and we pray. So that's where also AI is a game changer. Lisa, I think we like your profile. We are meeting. Your motivations. I think it's interesting. We are meeting. We have our first off site with the rest of. Co founders and some of the advisor who's going to join us. We're going to spend a couple of days altogether, really as the kickoff official kickoff. And we're going to discuss about different people that we've been meeting. I think we're going to discuss two things. The timing. And. The personality of the profile of the candidate that we have. So that's going to happen. We are meeting on over the weekend, actually. So I'll probably give you an update. Early next week. On next step, if that's okay with you. Okay, good. Any other questions? Point to one of these. Guests.

### You (2026-01-27T18:17:49.394Z)

No, I can't think of anything. I'm pulling up my notes. From my call with Steve. I think we're all around the same page. I didn't see any heads shaking. Yes or no? I don't really think I have any questions from that call. I think I found pretty clear on what your expectations are, so I guess. Waiting here from them next week.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:18:21.233Z)

Okay, cool. Well, thanks again. We'll touch. We'll talk soon.

### You (2026-01-27T18:18:27.314Z)

Okay? All right.

### Guest (2026-01-27T18:18:29.553Z)

Stay warm.

### You (2026-01-27T18:18:30.194Z)

Yeah, you too. We'll see. You.
