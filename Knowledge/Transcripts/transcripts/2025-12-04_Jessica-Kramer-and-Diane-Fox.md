# Transcript for: Jessica Kramer and Diane Fox

### Guest (2025-12-04T16:32:28.375Z)

To tell me last night. But my sister calls me. Back. Up.

### You (2025-12-04T16:32:49.905Z)

Good morning. How are you? Yeah. My apologies. I'm not used to zoom. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. I'm going to continue as the product guy. In my background, actually is also in real estate, analytics, business intelligence. So I'm also the data guy. There's not really. A tremendous impact in terms of the data withdrew, leaving. What Drew brought is he's from the asset management side. So he provided valuable input on the valuation model, but he was also more instrumental in testing qa. In fact, I've always described that Mark and Drew were more consultants than they were. Active founders. Yeah. Let me tell you how much as a product manager, that rubbed me the wrong way. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, no problem. Yeah. Just a couple other things to add to what we were talking about before. In terms of my role, Diane has an awful lot. Going on now? Focusing on fundraising and some of these other things. So it's going to be kind of more or less a co leadership, where I'm going to obviously be overseeing product, but also helping out to whatever extent I can, just in the upcoming operations. Yeah. We're not going to be staying in our lanes by any means. And also one thing I think Diane may have missed when she was talking about their friends and family, this gentleman also specializes now in ESOP setting up and maintaining. So that'd be helpful with the cap tables and setting that information up going forward. But as far as the development that we have so far, The proof of concept that I put together was very general. Kind of a mix of what a broker or an investor or a lender may want to see, but didn't really fit any one of those Personas perfectly. We've had some very good. Yeah. So we've had a number of very positive conversations with some contacts of Diane so that are on the lender and lender servicing group. And we have decided we want to focus on that. First, primarily because their underwriting doesn't get into the minutia that the broker and the investor does. Right. So, like food and beverage. They just look at food and beverage in total. They don't break it down into any of those subcategories or anything. And also just the process that they use is probably, I would say, a little bit easier and quicker. They would turn it around faster than somebody who has really got to dive into the minutia. So we were making some minor modifications to the model to accommodate that. So, for example, in the proof of concept, we had metric cards at the top of the screen. That included irr roi, cash on cash, returns. Metrics that the lenders don't pay attention to. They want the debt service coverage ratio, the yield, and all these different matrix. So we just simply have to swap out the formulas and change those cards. Very simple. As well as the setting up of a deal, the modal where you input the property, name, address, all this other stuff, we also want to make that kind of a one stop process. So instead of just setting up the deal with name and address, And then having to input certain assumptions in different places in the model. We want it all consolidated. So they'll be inputting what is the loan balance. What is the required debt service on there? What are the parameters, the caveats, the hurdles, whatever that a lender might be looking at, they just put it in there. And then they can modify it if they need to, but the idea is to just get that going so. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And this. Is. So this is also setting the stage for the next step, whereby right now it's manual. You know, you have to input a lot of that information. But AI is very good. At extracting certain information from documents. So the goal is let them go ahead and input the name and address, then upload the loan documents and extract the debt service requirements. All that other words. For them. So we'd see. Yeah, yeah. We could do the same thing for the brokers and lenders. So right now, this is where we're starting. This will be our lodging pad. So we've gotten a lot of that work done. We are very close just to finishing up that input modal and everything else. We're having very good success with extracting the data from the financial statements. And the only other. The other modification that we need to make for the lenders is they want to look at that information. Either on a monthly or a quarterly basis. Investor or broker model kind of looks at the historical data on an annual basis. So, you know, as long as we can upload a financial statement and extract a column that says 2024 annual or 2025 year to date, We just have to input the logic to look for months. 2025, January, 2025, February. Right. So, you know, it's not that we have to reinvent anything, it's just that we have to fine tune it for that. So I would say, you know, early in Q1 January, you know, maybe early February time frame, depending on, you know, how much work we can get done over the holidays. You know, we'll be ready to start doing some beta testing. With that.

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:09:06.575Z)

Right? It's. It's like that's the beginning of the sale, but at the phase you're at, it's going to make more sense to do the MVP. I kind of have a hard stop that started 10 minutes ago. We should find some more time, obviously. I'm in Paris in the first half of next week, but I have some time on Thursday and Friday. I would recommend maybe trying to find some time on my calendar Friday because I might be a little like jet lag, you know, bonkers on Thursday. But maybe we can just pick this up next week, and that'll give you a chance to kind of talk through what we talked about, and we can jump in from there. That would be great. The only thing is, maybe we could look at Tuesday or Thursday, that following week, if you're free. Yep. If that's a possibility just because of my calendar. But yes, if we could do that. And then we'll come Tuesday and Thursday afternoon after 2pm Both look open in that week of the 15th. So happy to do it then. Okay. Thank you. This was wonderful. We look forward to. We really do want to work with you, and we look forward to our next conversation. Awesome. Thank you.

### You (2025-12-04T17:10:19.695Z)

Jessica, could I ask a really quick question before we drop?

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:10:20.095Z)

Thank you. Sure. Of course. Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-12-04T17:10:24.095Z)

Okay. When you were talking about your services, I think we were talking or focusing on the advisory services. But would that also include advising just. On. The startup portion of the project. We've got very deep knowledge on hospitality, industry and product management.

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:10:44.975Z)

Yeah, of course.

### You (2025-12-04T17:10:47.215Z)

But I don't know the first thing about a startup. Right, so. Dotting I's and crossing T's. Yeah. Okay. All right.

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:10:48.095Z)

No, of course. I. Mean, that time is yours, Howard. Like, I. I mean, you know. You know, kind of like what my background is and what my skill set is. It's building startups, growing startups, getting investment in startups and hospitality. So, you know, I'm happy to play across all of those and connecting people, frankly, into, you know, the ecosystem that I've been building for many years. So, like, anything in that range, you know, and then some, you know, you need Paris restaurants. I got them, but I doubt you'll want to use your time that way.

### You (2025-12-04T17:11:05.775Z)

Okay? All right. Perfect. Okay? Yeah. That's negotiable. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. I'll let you get going.

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:11:28.255Z)

I mean, you know, those are. Those are what you'll do with the 24 7, you know, tech access to me.

### You (2025-12-04T17:11:33.135Z)

Yeah. There we go. Okay. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-12-04T17:11:35.935Z)

All right. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Bye.

### You (2025-12-04T17:11:38.975Z)

All right.
