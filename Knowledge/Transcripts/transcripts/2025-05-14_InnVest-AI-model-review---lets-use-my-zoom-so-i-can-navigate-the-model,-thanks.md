### You (2025-05-14T21:04:56.598Z)

How's everybody else? This is kind of how we look at deals. This is, our summary page.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:04:57.474Z)

Okay. Alright. Hey. Hey, Howard. How are doing?

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:00.888Z)

So just starting, like, in the top, like, just call it real c seven Right? So we enter, you know, tell me, just the basic information about the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:04.264Z)

Alright. So so this is kind of how we look at deal. This is, our summary page.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:09.488Z)

Then you're open right in the bed.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:10.194Z)

So just starting, like, in the top, like, let's call it row

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:11.478Z)

You know, talk about the capital

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:13.214Z)

c seven.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:14.278Z)

stack. Right? So typically,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:15.214Z)

Right? So we enter, you know, tell name and just the basic information about the asset.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:16.288Z)

and it just if I'm getting too granular, just stop me. But, you know, typically,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:19.174Z)

The year to open, renovate, and then, you know, talk about

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:20.728Z)

know, we look at how these deals will be capitalized.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:22.724Z)

you know, the capital stack

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:23.228Z)

So know, as as the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:24.714Z)

Right? So, typically,

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:24.988Z)

you know, generally, it's a GPLP structure, down partner with a partner.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:26.304Z)

and just if I'm getting too granular, just stop me. But, you know, typically,

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:28.608Z)

So there would be 40% equity

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:30.444Z)

you know, we look at how

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:31.518Z)

60% debt.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:31.964Z)

these deals will be capitalized. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:32.588Z)

And of that 40% equity,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:33.824Z)

you know, as the

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:34.608Z)

you know, we would generally put it

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:35.194Z)

you know, it's generally a GPLP structure, general partner, limited partner.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:36.308Z)

you know, 20% at the LP partner for the 80%. So this is kind of just summarizing

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:38.754Z)

So there would be 40% equity, 60% debt.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:41.918Z)

the proposed deal of capitalization

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:42.774Z)

And of that 40% equity,

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:44.088Z)

When the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:44.774Z)

you know, we would generally put in, you know, 20% and look to the LP partner for the 80%. So this is kind of just summarizing

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:46.868Z)

we get into how the deal is

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:52.114Z)

the proposed deal capitalization.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:52.388Z)

60% of total cost

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:54.384Z)

Right? Then we get into how the deal is

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:56.688Z)

The direct

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:05:58.364Z)

we're gonna structure the acquisition loan.

### You (2025-05-14T21:05:58.938Z)

And then you know, the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:00.494Z)

So, typically, the loan would be at 60% of

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:02.288Z)

the tip of You know, the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:03.774Z)

total cost.

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:04.058Z)

hotels

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:05.474Z)

You know, the rate, the the terms of the loan And then know, this is another important part of it. Typically, you know, the hotels that we buy have some kind of turnaround store So there'd be a reef you know, you have an acquisition loan,

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:16.348Z)

the refinance terms here.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:18.794Z)

and then two to three years after we own it, there would be a refinancing. So we would also kind of summarize the refinance terms here.

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:23.088Z)

You know, in sort of the the end. Step Yeah. Sort of right. Call. Closing cost, And then there would be schedules

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:31.234Z)

You know, here we summarize, you know, in in sort of

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:32.658Z)

subschedules for each of these items.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:34.474Z)

the the m seven, the actual sort of purchase price, the renovation cost,

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:36.658Z)

And typically with a hotels, we look at

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:40.134Z)

closing cost, and then there would be schedules, subschedules for each of these items. And then typically, with hotels, we look at it on a gross

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:47.378Z)

analysis you know, both historic and

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:49.614Z)

and then we look at it on a price per key.

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:51.338Z)

well as forward looking.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:51.864Z)

Which is an important way to look at these things.

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:52.388Z)

And, you know, deal

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:54.464Z)

Then we have our sort of cap rate

### You (2025-05-14T21:06:57.018Z)

you know, what the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:06:57.734Z)

analysis you know, both historic as well as forward looking.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:00.878Z)

we have to Quick questions for that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:02.654Z)

Then here in deal notes, we would just put, like, a little summary of of

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:06.588Z)

Money

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:07.094Z)

you know, what what the opportunity is.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:08.108Z)

by the order. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:09.484Z)

Is this supposed to be like a interrupting you.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:10.428Z)

There is spent this much to renovate.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:12.534Z)

Quick question. So that renovation cost

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:12.788Z)

The hotel while buying or It

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:14.994Z)

is, like, the money required while buying the

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:16.668Z)

required.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:19.344Z)

hotel. Like, they only spent this much renovate the hotel while buying? Or Yes. So typically, you would buy the in this case, we're buying the hotel for 19,000,000. Then we're putting another 1.2 in you know, to fix up the guest rooms, to fix up the lobby. You know, just to improve the overall condition of the assets so that we can

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:36.078Z)

You know, through closing you

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:38.814Z)

project a higher ADR or or rate.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:39.198Z)

pay reserve.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:41.904Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. Please continue.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:44.758Z)

Keep fit. That

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:46.774Z)

You know, then there are closing costs and and and interest reserves to carry the hotel.

### You (2025-05-14T21:07:47.928Z)

see. You know, some of are paid. Then

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:07:51.744Z)

So these are all kind of this is like a these are all the kind of key points that investors would wanna see. Know, summarized on one page? Then on on reverse

### You (2025-05-14T21:08:00.588Z)

Yeah. But it it there. Like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:08:04.574Z)

Hey, Mark. Real quick.

### You (2025-05-14T21:08:04.878Z)

fire code is, like, a

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:08:05.594Z)

Do you guys have, sub schedule for renovation cost? So, like Yeah. Yeah. But is that number there like, a hard coded, like, a assumption upfront? Or okay. It looks like it's In in this case, it's hard coded, but, typically, it wouldn't be. I don't know why it is on this version. But, typically, this renovation box would have you see these tabs on the bottom?

### You (2025-05-14T21:08:27.158Z)

might too

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:08:29.934Z)

Each of these is, a sub tab, so we would have a

### You (2025-05-14T21:08:30.468Z)

thousand. Guestrooms.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:08:32.614Z)

tab called renovation cost. And then we would show line by line where this million 2 was being allocated. So maybe it's you know, 600,000 guest rooms, 200,000 for lobby, 200,000 for miscellaneous mechanical engineering plumbing. That kind of thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So we so that's a good so each of these points would have a subpage. With the detail. And then, you know, here, the reversion refers to the when the asset

### You (2025-05-14T21:08:59.128Z)

Was immediate

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:03.454Z)

when the hotel gets sold, generally five years from

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:04.408Z)

What's, like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:06.304Z)

acquisition. In this case, it was a ten year hold. Because there were some unique circumstances.

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:08.828Z)

how much closing cost

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:11.014Z)

So we're summarizing you know, these are kind of the key

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:11.328Z)

So it's 1.5. Which is we have a subschedule

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:13.864Z)

data points, like exit cap rate,

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:15.188Z)

that summarizes like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:16.434Z)

hold period,

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:16.778Z)

what the actual causes are

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:17.494Z)

sale price per key,

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:18.278Z)

close for the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:19.444Z)

how much closing costs. So this 1.5 which to Drew's point, would have a subschedule.

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:20.358Z)

case. You know, you have to for

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:25.714Z)

That summarizes, like, what the actual costs are to close on the loan,

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:28.508Z)

Mark, quick question for you.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:29.824Z)

the acquisition in this case? You know, then you have a debt schedule.

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:32.348Z)

You've got a couple of sections there that are just solid black.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:34.374Z)

So each of these line items have their own

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:35.938Z)

Is there something that's usually there that's not

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:36.474Z)

sort of tab below. Or should.

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:38.578Z)

in this particular model, or is that just a filler? Yeah. I guess it's a really pillar. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:52.544Z)

Yeah. I mean, these are I I guess that it's really a filler. I mean, based on the nuances of the deal,

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:57.658Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:09:58.694Z)

are kinda like placeholders that we wanted to add some comments.

### You (2025-05-14T21:09:58.858Z)

So that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:10:02.414Z)

Because when we're speaking with investors, this would typically be the page

### You (2025-05-14T21:10:02.458Z)

yep. Question about return. So you could say we have the iron ore.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:10:05.864Z)

that we spend the majority of our time on. So then there was a question about returns. So here you could see we talk about the IRR. The equity multiple, know, the gross multiple, This was a question that came up the other day. So these are IRRs. And these are equity multiples. So you put in a hundred dollars, you, you know, you get 200 back, that would be

### You (2025-05-14T21:10:28.828Z)

Here. A snapshot of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:10:31.234Z)

two x

### You (2025-05-14T21:10:32.578Z)

going

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:10:33.204Z)

These are the hurdle rates for the promotes.

### You (2025-05-14T21:10:34.078Z)

forward. So let's get to ten year deals.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:10:36.754Z)

And then down here, we typically have a snapshot of performance going forward. So in this case, it's a ten year deal. So we're showing kind of just at a high level You know, we're seeing how we're ramping up occupancy and rate. And how the revenue increases. This is not a full statement. This is more of a summary statement.

### You (2025-05-14T21:11:02.678Z)

Here. Yeah. Flow.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:11:05.434Z)

And the key is down here. We get to a cash on cash yield. Then you could see down here kind of how the cash flow would be allocated. Between in this case, there's a cash flow prep and then there's

### You (2025-05-14T21:11:24.248Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:11:24.824Z)

the various cash flows that are paid out

### You (2025-05-14T21:11:28.218Z)

pretty

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:11:29.244Z)

and this

### You (2025-05-14T21:11:29.328Z)

good sign. But very

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:11:30.654Z)

would be the ultimate deal IRR

### You (2025-05-14T21:11:32.798Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:11:36.334Z)

So, I mean, to me, this is a pretty concise but very user friendly summary page. Is this consistent with what you guys have seen? Yeah. Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. And I could I could send this around after the call if you guys wanna you know, play with it. Yeah. That would be great. Happy to share. Yeah. This part, a lot of it is would probably be the same for any

### You (2025-05-14T21:12:03.988Z)

point. You know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:12:06.034Z)

any real estate asset. Right? It doesn't like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:12:09.898Z)

Well, you you yeah. Even in that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:12:10.094Z)

almost nothing on here is hotel Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a fair point.

### You (2025-05-14T21:12:12.958Z)

even in that you know, especially, you know, like multifamily, we look at it on a per unit basis. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:12:15.694Z)

You know, other than the kind of the per key version. But, yeah, I mean, this is pretty standard.

### You (2025-05-14T21:12:19.768Z)

So we take our total divided by the number of units. This is basically doing the same thing. With the number of keys. Now, let me ask you this also. Are the number of keys always the same as the number of rooms? In other words, are they just interchangeable terms or is there actually a difference between rooms and keys? So have this week. Sweet. Yeah. Suites have lots.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:12:49.754Z)

Well, that that's a source of great debate. Yeah. So, you know, typically, like, if you have a suite, one bedroom suite,

### You (2025-05-14T21:12:58.458Z)

So so

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:12:58.954Z)

with a lock sometimes suites have lock offs.

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:01.698Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:02.034Z)

So if you go into the living room or parlor of a suite, there may be a couch, but in in last resort, that couch could be turned into a bed.

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:06.388Z)

So foyer

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:09.054Z)

So some owners would actually count that as two keys

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:10.128Z)

you can sell

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:13.364Z)

because you could actually sell the parlor and lock off the room.

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:13.698Z)

So that one.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:16.924Z)

Sometimes there's a foyer and there are two bedrooms, so you could actually sell it as one key or as two keys. So you're not that black and white.

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:28.608Z)

Somebody.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:29.274Z)

Well, it's but it's usually, like, I mean, that number is usually determined at some point by somebody and then I feel like rarely changes or or at least at this level of

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:42.348Z)

Yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:42.714Z)

of the of the deal. I mean,

### You (2025-05-14T21:13:45.388Z)

each bit. Is a

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:13:47.484Z)

or I don't know. Maybe I guess it does. Maybe it changes here more than any other Yeah. I mean, typically, a good rule of thumb, Howard, is, like, each bed is a key.

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:00.868Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:01.384Z)

Each bed. Right. Obviously, if you have a double bedded room, that's still one key. But if you have, like, a

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:01.638Z)

So Yeah. So Vinod, that sounds to me like it'd be

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:05.804Z)

a bedroom and then you have a parlor, a living room,

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:07.628Z)

the same as student housing. Right? Remember in student housing,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:09.004Z)

but that living room has a Murphy bed or a couch bed,

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:11.938Z)

they rent by the bed.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:13.024Z)

then it could be theoretically split into two keys.

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:13.368Z)

Not by the unit. So sounds to me like keys is the same thing as bed. And not room? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:22.134Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:28.008Z)

Well yeah. But what yeah. What we're what I'm talking about is when you have two students in a room,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:29.584Z)

Well, but in student housing, you may have, like, two occupants in one room.

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:33.258Z)

that's it that's called you know, it it would still be called two beds.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:14:33.554Z)

In hotels, you don't do that because that gets a little you know, we don't do that. We don't go that extreme.

### You (2025-05-14T21:14:37.848Z)

It might be one bedroom, but you're actually signing a lease with each of those students. So yeah, I I mean, I'm I'm just trying to to to frame this in a way that Vinod and I are can kind of use what we've done in the past and relate Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:05.544Z)

Yeah. But I I guess with hotels, like, each key would have its own

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:07.648Z)

That comes off that Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:09.974Z)

on the door. That's another way to think about it. Whereas in housing, you may have, like, one locked door and two students sharing a suite, in hotels. Each room needs to have its own bed and its own locked door.

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:19.948Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:21.314Z)

Yeah. I think each I think of key as, like, yeah, any door that can lock and be sold, you know, that's

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:25.138Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:27.934Z)

count all those up. And that's that's how much you end up with.

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:32.928Z)

These assumptions

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:33.454Z)

But those are really little tweaks that we could adjust over time.

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:34.228Z)

about So example think the estimate output is

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:39.544Z)

But I think the key here is to have these subtabs underneath

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:42.308Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:43.204Z)

that tie to these assumptions above. So, like, for example, like, the STR output, this is a very important page where

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:49.458Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:15:51.274Z)

you kind of list how your competition is performing. And then you do a penetration analysis to show how effective you think your hotel could be vis a vis the competition?

### You (2025-05-14T21:15:59.688Z)

What the potential of an asset

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:01.074Z)

This is a page that, you know, hotel people spend a lot of time scrutinizing, and and, typically, there could be multiple different sets

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:06.198Z)

how we

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:08.274Z)

to benchmark against because this kind of shows you what the potential of the asset could be. So this is an important area to really think about in how we present. So you can see here, like, on top, it's subject property.

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:24.788Z)

multiple. Sets. That your benchmark

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:28.134Z)

And then we show occupancy rate and RevPAR, and then we show competitive set.

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:30.378Z)

K. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:32.104Z)

Below.

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:33.398Z)

My question

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:33.694Z)

And then you wanna list, like, who's in the set, and there could be multiple sets that you're benchmarking against.

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:37.518Z)

last can I be? Sure.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:43.504Z)

Yeah. Sorry, Mark. My my question

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:44.988Z)

Tell it's up

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:45.854Z)

probably be very basic for you, what I'll is the last

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:46.068Z)

except percent and your

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:48.874Z)

What does occupancy

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:49.768Z)

status also at 70% of your

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:51.274Z)

penetration mean?

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:51.528Z)

see that you're 30% penetration

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:54.394Z)

So if your hotel is operating at 70% occupancy,

### You (2025-05-14T21:16:58.508Z)

Exactly. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:16:59.724Z)

and your competitive set is also at 70% occupancy, then you're at a % penetration against your comp set.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:02.538Z)

Over health that or subject property of the market it's of whatever

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:06.674Z)

I thought you're in that. It's like in a dice. Exactly. Yeah. The subject property overcomes that

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:13.708Z)

to

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:14.784Z)

or subject property over market. It's

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:16.258Z)

there they're

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:16.964Z)

subject property over whatever it is you're indexing against.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:19.758Z)

this case.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:19.924Z)

And whatever metric you're so you're gonna ask

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:20.238Z)

Different.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:22.414Z)

occupancy index, ADR index, RevPAR index,

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:24.128Z)

Thank you. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:27.084Z)

You know, the there is index and penetration or you are interchangeable in this case.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:30.628Z)

sixty four. And the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:32.084Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:33.458Z)

see if he three. See,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:34.754Z)

Okay. Thank you.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:37.268Z)

6%. Penetrated

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:38.054Z)

So for example, Vinod here, the the occupancy for the subject property is 64. And the competitive set occupancy is 83.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:39.468Z)

Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's interesting. I would good question, Vinod. I wasn't aware of that either.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:46.274Z)

Yeah. So the hotel is at a 76% penetration.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:46.718Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:51.204Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-05-14T21:17:57.848Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:17:58.304Z)

So that's how how people get comfortable that where the upside of their asset, they compare themselves to. To the others.

### You (2025-05-14T21:18:06.628Z)

over five penetration.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:18:08.394Z)

So when you're doing a projection, you may say that over the next

### You (2025-05-14T21:18:09.108Z)

To a hundred of his escape. Six. Tonight. Six.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:18:12.914Z)

five years, you wanna achieve a 10% penetration

### You (2025-05-14T21:18:14.528Z)

And more

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:18:16.824Z)

Right? So you would show over a five year period going from 76 to a hundred, or in this case, we're going from 76 to 96. Yeah. And

### You (2025-05-14T21:18:25.818Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:18:26.904Z)

Mark, from the we've Howard, Vinod, and I have talked about, like, the user journey a couple of times. And was part of what I I put in, like, kind of, like, the the like, the order of that that users would do things. In one of the things that Howard put together a while ago. And in this case, just to just to, like, bring that back up, putting in the deal attributes like the property name, address, number of keys, that sort of thing. Right? It's that that's you know, easily it's the first thing that anybody's gonna do. The next thing that they're gonna do

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:05.488Z)

That sort of thing. What what

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:07.734Z)

I can't remember what it was that I if I said it was, like, putting in your financing and act

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:09.438Z)

What

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:12.494Z)

acquisition terms, think it was putting, like, financing acquisitions terms sort of thing. Loan, maybe loan terms, And then

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:20.858Z)

it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:21.904Z)

the

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:22.648Z)

Benchmarking

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:23.474Z)

the next thing

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:24.038Z)

is like your company?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:25.204Z)

was your CapEx of, like, you know, putting your CapEx amounts And then the next thing was, like, your cost that

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:30.658Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:34.164Z)

benchmarking, you know, selecting your comp set. And then and and doing your your penetration analysis. Do you agree with that?

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:39.568Z)

See how the hotel.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:41.634Z)

Yeah. I mean, I I think we could sort of debate the order, but those

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:43.178Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:44.834Z)

are all very important things. I I would add also

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:45.038Z)

you know, six year of historic data.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:47.054Z)

this historical analysis

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:48.968Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:49.084Z)

you know, because acquisitions people like to see how the the

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:49.638Z)

you know, not to try but typically, in the act

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:52.454Z)

hotel has performed in the past as well.

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:53.458Z)

year,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:54.874Z)

So here, you know, we looked at know, six years of historical data.

### You (2025-05-14T21:19:56.718Z)

So, for example, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:19:58.704Z)

And

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:00.638Z)

you know, you'd want to know tag all the time before.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:01.274Z)

know, not to drive you too crazy, but, typically, in the acquisition year,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:05.258Z)

Every

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:05.624Z)

you do what's called, like, a trailing twelve.

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:07.458Z)

you'll get monthly hours

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:09.044Z)

So for example,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:09.508Z)

So you wanna

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:10.264Z)

you know, if you're buying a hotel in June,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:10.778Z)

this 12 column here. So each month,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:12.324Z)

you know, you'd wanna look at the hotel how the hotel performed in the prior twelve months and then

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:13.008Z)

to talk. You can update performance. And all. Time. You'll

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:17.004Z)

every month, you'll wanna update

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:18.368Z)

to pair. Current

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:19.064Z)

You'll get monthly numbers,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:19.938Z)

foreign to

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:21.104Z)

So you wanna have this trailing 12 column here so that each month

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:22.198Z)

what? Respond to to Well,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:25.284Z)

you can update performance. And then oftentimes,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:26.238Z)

So it just gets a little bit

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:28.374Z)

you'll wanna compare

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:29.148Z)

technical. But that's

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:30.584Z)

current performance by month,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:32.088Z)

key. Ways to look at our

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:32.694Z)

to budget Right? So you wanna do an actual budget for the year of acquisition as well?

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:35.198Z)

you're looking at the sales

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:37.884Z)

So it gets a little bit

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:39.958Z)

And they

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:40.544Z)

technical, but but that's those are also

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:41.808Z)

one

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:43.584Z)

key ways to look at hotels. So, for example, if you're looking at buying a hotel in 02/2025,

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:44.668Z)

to the performance. See how hotels trended So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:48.884Z)

the seller would give you a budget by month

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:51.208Z)

these are all the columns that I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:51.524Z)

And then each month, you would get actual numbers. You'd wanna compare the budget

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:53.658Z)

typically acquisition people wanna consider as part of that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:20:56.244Z)

to the actual performance to see how the hotel is trending.

### You (2025-05-14T21:20:56.578Z)

Initial underwriting rules. Was saying. Yeah. And we we just sort of talk about it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:21:01.004Z)

So, you know, these are all columns that that

### You (2025-05-14T21:21:02.298Z)

For half year

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:21:05.154Z)

typically acquisition people would wanna consider as part of that

### You (2025-05-14T21:21:06.398Z)

you know, between now and

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:21:08.104Z)

initial underwriting, as Drew was was saying. And we and we did sort of talk about how for past years, it it's really, all your you know, if you're if it's

### You (2025-05-14T21:21:13.978Z)

gonna be or the current

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:21:18.794Z)

2025 now, right, Past year 2024, '23, '22, '21, it's just it's always gonna be actuals for the for the current year, it could be a forecast a t 12, or a budget. So a user might wanna look at one you know, they might select. You know, I I I wanna use the budget as the current year. I wanna use the t 12 as the target year. I wanna use forecast. So that would be kind of an option.

### You (2025-05-14T21:21:56.208Z)

that is completed some other But it just gives you a sense of how people

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:00.964Z)

Yeah. So I I can send this around. You guys, you know, complain about it. This

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:02.408Z)

deals.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:05.684Z)

analysis is not

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:06.138Z)

To the free cash flow. Statement showing

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:07.964Z)

as complete as some other ones are, but but it'll just give you a sense of how

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:09.038Z)

the impact of debt

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:11.754Z)

people generally look at these these deals. Yeah. This is a cash flow

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:17.828Z)

this. Yeah. I I like to see

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:19.354Z)

statement showing the impact of debt.

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:21.088Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:21.944Z)

So there's lots of different ways to,

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:25.888Z)

The cash flows K.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:27.784Z)

kinda look at this.

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:28.248Z)

It's good to know what the life of work.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:30.044Z)

This is the promote this is the promotes page. This is a very important page.

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:32.298Z)

Analysis

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:34.644Z)

To show how the different partners receive cash flows. It's good to know is there, like, a waterfall analysis Vinod, do you understand how that works?

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:51.618Z)

60%.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:52.664Z)

Not completely, but

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:54.588Z)

Typically GP

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:54.964Z)

So, typically, if you're buying a hotel,

### You (2025-05-14T21:22:55.718Z)

put it The LP would

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:22:57.494Z)

you know, you may give you know, there's

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:00.168Z)

Make off the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:00.224Z)

equity and debt. Right? So the equity is 60% 40%. The debt is 60%.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:01.238Z)

timeshare. So the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:04.394Z)

Of that forty, you know, typically, GP would put in 10 to 20% the LP would put in the difference, and the LP may oftentimes get what's called a preferred return.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:12.048Z)

Vinod gets disproportionate amount of the cash flows, accomplishing dental weight.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:15.104Z)

Mhmm. Maybe the LP is getting, like, the first 8% on their investment.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:16.468Z)

And give the, you know, fee the first 8%. Okay. So that's typically

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:19.704Z)

Okay. And then after the LP gets 8%, the GP

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:20.948Z)

know, know, very high level. So this is kind of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:24.394Z)

may get a disproportionate amount of the cash flows to compensate them for waiting.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:26.728Z)

how it works. Forward. For a year.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:28.594Z)

And giving the LP the first 8% Okay. That's typically known as a waterfall

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:30.208Z)

Yeah. Vinod, it's it's actually if you think about it, there's differ different

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:33.914Z)

a in a very high level. So this is kind of

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:34.128Z)

levels of investors.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:36.174Z)

summarizing how the waterfall would work per year.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:36.498Z)

Right? Yeah. So one particular investor might be taking more risk. So they're

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:41.134Z)

Awesome. Thank you.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:44.278Z)

they're the ones that get the first cut. You know?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:23:45.874Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:23:46.988Z)

So yeah. You know, typically, you know, this isn't just one person who is buying the property. Right? Just like in multifamily, where we have the the the partnerships that joined them. When Red IQ our waterfall was in in the Excel model, valuation IQ. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:24:08.884Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-14T21:24:08.988Z)

we'll want to have something like this that we can include in in the online valuation model here. And so I I I can I can put that together in terms of the calculations and everything? Sounds good. Sounds good. Yeah. Thank you. So can kinda see how the numbers work.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:24:34.744Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. Thank you for explaining that, Mark. And you can see there are formulas in these cells. So you could kinda see how the numbers work. Cool.

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:02.648Z)

History,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:04.074Z)

What else would be helpful?

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:04.328Z)

operating statement history,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:05.454Z)

Tanner, is it possible to just briefly go through each tab? Like, what is import?

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:10.848Z)

college or kids in this model. Have you tried

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:13.014Z)

Operation, history,

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:13.788Z)

more? Things completed.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:15.834Z)

operating statement history, or

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:16.178Z)

I just want is more

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:18.714Z)

Yeah. So these are really just these are more not all these these

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:19.058Z)

like comparing. The store performance. To the projection of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:22.544Z)

columns are used in this model. I could try to find a model that has more

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:24.428Z)

This is kind of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:26.144Z)

things completed.

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:26.188Z)

start to look at some of the Smith Traveler star, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:28.184Z)

But this one, is more like comparing the historical performance to the

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:31.028Z)

know, the part of both In this case, a lot of the data

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:33.564Z)

projection going forward. This is kind of

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:37.308Z)

the start. Report.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:38.274Z)

starting to look at some of the Smith Travel or STAR data.

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:39.928Z)

So the node, what I'm seeing here is this has got most

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:41.514Z)

You know, this is an input of of

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:43.758Z)

of the same information that we have in the other

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:44.244Z)

in this case, a lot of the data, again, that came from the

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:46.308Z)

sample that we've been looking at. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:49.214Z)

the star report

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:49.358Z)

Might be laid out a little bit

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:25:50.334Z)

Gotcha.

### You (2025-05-14T21:25:50.738Z)

differently, but what we don't have is all that star information. So that'll be extremely valuable if we can get our hands on this model so we can take a look at that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:00.354Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:01.348Z)

And I don't believe the the the sample that we have has a distribution waterfall, so that'll be very helpful as well. Extras Okay. And as far as that STR that one. For So we'll have to pull that data

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:26.114Z)

Cool. So we'll be adding these extras to our existing model then?

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:30.898Z)

but, again, like, I I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:32.124Z)

Okay. And as far as that

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:33.458Z)

think I said

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:34.214Z)

STR data one goes,

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:34.668Z)

you a back help like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:36.094Z)

we'll have to pull that data from somewhere. So I'm always thinking of where to get the data from, but

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:36.368Z)

sample data And and then that PR

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:41.064Z)

Well, the SDR data is

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:41.438Z)

reports. Very good cutter

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:42.874Z)

that's, again, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:43.848Z)

very consistent

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:43.914Z)

I I

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:44.838Z)

consistent,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:45.404Z)

think I

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:45.608Z)

only

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:46.184Z)

spent

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:46.398Z)

included

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:46.574Z)

you about some, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:47.288Z)

as part of it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:48.364Z)

sample data Yeah. You did. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:49.558Z)

The broker. Like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:50.794Z)

Yeah. And

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:50.898Z)

you know, do

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:51.894Z)

and then STR reports

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:52.468Z)

like, a a deal package. Right? See what we're gonna get.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:54.024Z)

are very cookie cutter, very consistent,

### You (2025-05-14T21:26:56.048Z)

That data from the equity of our report. Did you have an example of the star report?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:26:57.194Z)

and always included as part of a a

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:00.718Z)

I mean, would that be nobody's someone around?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:01.464Z)

broker, like, you know, do

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:04.198Z)

I probably do have one time and through a period.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:04.384Z)

like, a a deal package. Right? Like so you're always gonna get

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:07.288Z)

But, yeah, it's difficult to also share with

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:07.984Z)

that data from the FTR report.

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:09.778Z)

What we have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:10.294Z)

Did you have an example of a star report?

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:10.908Z)

one more option.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:12.684Z)

Mean, would that be you want me to send one around?

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:13.168Z)

And two, otherwise.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:14.634Z)

I think we do have one that

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:15.078Z)

I was thinking So when the user is uploading, so we get that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:18.084Z)

Drew shared.

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:19.238Z)

But when we

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:19.654Z)

But, yeah, if you could also share with

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:20.128Z)

pulling from the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:21.784Z)

probably have one more option.

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:22.968Z)

portal will be there.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:23.574Z)

But, Drew, why why I was thinking

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:24.538Z)

Do we have that data as well?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:27.684Z)

thinking so when the user is uploading, so we get that.

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:30.958Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:31.144Z)

But when we are pulling from BI system, your total BI

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:31.808Z)

I think that that's how I think that's how CR. Of course. As well. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:36.524Z)

we have that data as well?

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:36.818Z)

I think it's hard get having data now to work with

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:43.144Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I can get I can get you SDR data from our system as well. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:43.848Z)

Like, use what I'm providing you know, I think

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:48.724Z)

I think far just as far as, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:50.088Z)

whether part of the MVP

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:51.294Z)

yeah, like, having data now to work with,

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:52.098Z)

or or shortly thereafter,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:54.574Z)

Mhmm. Like, use what I am providing.

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:54.608Z)

we'll set we'll set up a process to pull data from an SDR report.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:27:58.924Z)

You know,

### You (2025-05-14T21:27:59.668Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:00.134Z)

I I think whether it's part of the MVP

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:01.628Z)

Cool. And and it language takes

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:04.044Z)

or or shortly thereafter. We'll set you'll we'll set up a process to pull data from an STR report.

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:07.138Z)

they if there is an opportunity to make that, you know, our system is pulling

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:14.454Z)

Cool. And and in in which case, add users

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:17.548Z)

if

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:18.414Z)

open a new deal, put in the information, of the first things they'll do Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:23.258Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:24.334Z)

you'll check to see if if there's historical data in our system and pull it if there is. If not, they'll have to load STR reports.

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:27.818Z)

that from the model. Because right now, we're just getting

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:31.804Z)

And and

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:31.908Z)

the data from

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:32.744Z)

and historical DNL and whatnot.

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:32.878Z)

portal. Yeah. When we have that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:34.864Z)

Yeah. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:35.438Z)

capability and product, we could

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:35.884Z)

so, Howard, till we have that STL one, I think we can exclude that from the model.

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:37.608Z)

have that. Tab as well. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:28:40.674Z)

Because you know, right now, we are just getting the data from portal BIS. When we have that capability, then probably we could add that tab as well.

### You (2025-05-14T21:28:50.668Z)

I to you the ones that are kind of the core for that are most critical to look at. To be able to

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:00.094Z)

Yeah. I mean Did you want it

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:00.268Z)

see it on time.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:01.304Z)

talk about Mark? I

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:01.368Z)

If you kinda have some of them here, and you have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:03.034Z)

mentioned some metrics

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:04.668Z)

you know, higher

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:04.704Z)

think Diane did too, the ones that are kind of the four or five or six that are most critical to look at. To be able to see at all times. And you kinda have some of them here. Right? You have

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:15.058Z)

if we have the different with different classes of adventurers. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:17.134Z)

I mean, IRR,

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:18.728Z)

you know, we have the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:19.814Z)

multiple on equity or multiple

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:19.878Z)

is the LP investor. This is the GP investor. This is the gross return

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:23.464Z)

an Yeah. I mean, this is IRR and the equity multiple.

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:24.828Z)

for the deal. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:25.774Z)

And, you know, we have the different IRRs for different classes of investors. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:26.168Z)

So, again, the warrants that show the three levels of returns

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:30.634Z)

you know, we have the this is the LP investor. This is the GP investor. This is the gross return for the deal itself.

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:37.068Z)

And then, yeah, we show the the cash and cash

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:39.184Z)

I think it's important to show the three levels of

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:40.888Z)

and then they have leverage

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:41.794Z)

returns.

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:42.528Z)

cash and cash as well. So that's what I'll start in a grow this. Week. This this will be up to the same box.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:49.374Z)

And then down here, we show the the cash on cash and then the unlevered cash on cash as well.

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:55.528Z)

So so

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:56.004Z)

So those are also I mean, in a perfect world, this

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:58.238Z)

then I'll

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:29:58.704Z)

this this and this would be all in the same box.

### You (2025-05-14T21:29:58.888Z)

finger back. This. So they can't pick can't you know, basically, how much return the investor gets each year of the investor And then is sort of the summary of the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:08.014Z)

So so, Vinod, this is for your benefits

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:08.418Z)

entire

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:11.424Z)

So the cash on cash would be, you know, basically how much

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:11.708Z)

Howard, one thing So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:13.894Z)

return the investor gets each year of the investment.

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:14.488Z)

if we if you're thinking about you know, you're just having some kind of panels showing

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:17.064Z)

And then the IRR and the multiple is sort of a summary of the entire length of the investment.

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:19.528Z)

specific metrics like, this is all at all

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:22.924Z)

Okay. Howard,

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:24.138Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:24.904Z)

one thing

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:25.048Z)

and can

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:25.804Z)

so

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:25.848Z)

the user

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:26.464Z)

if we

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:26.608Z)

see.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:27.014Z)

you're thinking about

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:27.098Z)

Them and

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:28.144Z)

you know, you mentioned having up some kind of panel that's showing

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:29.308Z)

how they change. Input. In their assumption. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:32.144Z)

specific metrics. If it's visible at all times, and and can the user can see them and and see how they change as they change their inputs and their assumptions.

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:43.848Z)

For

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:46.014Z)

Yeah. Originally, I I was thinking that would be one number,

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:46.868Z)

Although, see,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:49.604Z)

for you know, you'd have one IRR. You'd have one MO, you know, multiple on invested capital and one or

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:53.248Z)

like, there's so big so much more than multifamily office. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:56.144Z)

know, number free. The other metrics.

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:57.658Z)

You know, as as performance.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:30:58.904Z)

Although,

### You (2025-05-14T21:30:59.788Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:00.094Z)

seeing this

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:00.858Z)

The

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:01.034Z)

kind of reminds me that

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:01.588Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:02.224Z)

because hotels

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:02.278Z)

like, you know, or your

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:04.144Z)

like, they're so they fluctuate so much more than multifamily or office,

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:05.358Z)

know, of your trouble.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:09.084Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:09.258Z)

A lot.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:09.744Z)

you know, as far as far as performance.

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:10.628Z)

Yeah. Right? If it was positive,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:12.554Z)

The the your IRR or your, you know, multiple your return multiple or your

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:19.628Z)

21,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:19.794Z)

cash on cash can change a lot from year to year.

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:20.968Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:22.534Z)

Right?

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:22.608Z)

Almost almost Like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:24.364Z)

It was possible I mean, to to Drew, to your point, I mean, here, it's 5.1, 6.5, 8.9.

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:25.398Z)

the users selected you know, ten years ago. Period.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:29.484Z)

9.2. It shoots up to 19.

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:29.628Z)

It's it's

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:31.824Z)

21, Yeah. It's like one of the one of the like, so in this in this case, like, user selected

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:37.638Z)

feel like, oh, wow. Like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:38.694Z)

you know, ten years as the whole period. However, it's it's

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:42.258Z)

but

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:42.664Z)

this my last company one of my last companies did this too. Right? It's like you select the whole period

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:45.798Z)

return. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:46.864Z)

but then you would also look at it every year, and you might feel like, oh, wow. Like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:48.508Z)

If it were possible to have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:50.794Z)

I selected to hold it for five years or six years or ten years, but

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:53.378Z)

people.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:54.484Z)

if I could sell it in year four,

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:56.108Z)

Some

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:56.704Z)

I'm gonna get the biggest return.

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:57.148Z)

like you know, the four or five key metrics

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:58.414Z)

For

### You (2025-05-14T21:31:59.128Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:31:59.134Z)

IRR or whatever. So it were possible to have

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:01.498Z)

For weird.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:02.984Z)

you know, year one through ten like, you probably could only have to do on top or just do it on the side. But, like, something that shows, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:07.728Z)

You know, which year.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:09.464Z)

you know, the four or five key metrics and

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:11.348Z)

For each metric

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:12.364Z)

for the for the years one, two, three,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:12.518Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:14.784Z)

know, all the way through 10, like, by year, I don't know if that's possible, but it could maybe highlight, you know, which years are highest for each metrics. It might be interest that might be an interesting way to see, like, oh, as as I'm changing these things,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:28.658Z)

You know, a big part of the hotel.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:30.144Z)

how is it changing the

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:30.858Z)

Investment.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:31.704Z)

not just the total IRR for the year I selected,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:31.708Z)

In is through leverage. Or debt. So typically, would

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:34.644Z)

you know, the I IRR for any given year.

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:35.498Z)

an acquisition loan. You know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:37.024Z)

Or or calendar year. Just to just to add to Drew's comment,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:37.378Z)

day we buy the hotel. But then we do a refinance.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:40.714Z)

you know, a big part of the hotel

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:42.128Z)

To so that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:43.044Z)

investing is is through leverage or debt.

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:45.338Z)

out. Video.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:45.704Z)

So, typically, we would have an acquisition loan

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:46.208Z)

To part of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:48.594Z)

you know, the day we buy the hotel,

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:49.948Z)

return. It's such fluctuation.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:50.534Z)

but then we would do a refinancing in the second or third year of ownership.

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:51.788Z)

You know, for example, was me. Through nothing too.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:54.104Z)

To so that

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:54.358Z)

Tonight. You know, part of that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:55.614Z)

ownership could pull more of their money out of the deal.

### You (2025-05-14T21:32:58.088Z)

the investment get back around the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:32:58.294Z)

As early as they can. So that's part of the reason why the cash and cash returns have such fluctuation.

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:01.868Z)

So you know, just point

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:03.734Z)

You know, for example, it goes from eight to nine to

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:04.778Z)

to Catherine. And the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:06.394Z)

to 19. You know, part of that is because this is the refinancing

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:09.568Z)

to the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:10.144Z)

The investors get back a lot of the money they originally put in the deal.

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:12.198Z)

which was summarized here

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:13.364Z)

So, you know, to Drew's point, it's important to show these cash on cash and

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:15.548Z)

We have this box. Yeah. That's right.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:18.154Z)

and the, unlevered returns

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:19.988Z)

A debate we have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:20.614Z)

per year in addition to the

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:20.948Z)

the whole time, but

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:22.254Z)

cumulative returns

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:23.378Z)

this up to here is

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:24.264Z)

which are summarized here. This these cash and cash returns

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:24.608Z)

one summarize. Investor return.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:27.644Z)

really should be part of this box. I I well, it's a debate we have internally all the time, but right way to do it would be to move this up to here. So there's one box that really summarizes all the investor returns. Or well, Mark, what I was saying is you could take IRR and those other metrics and put them down with with the cash on cash and show them by year. Yeah. Well, typically typically, you wouldn't look at IRR

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:51.788Z)

It's too like a

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:53.324Z)

by year. I I haven't really seen that

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:53.618Z)

piece decision. So you know, it's not like can just decide

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:56.034Z)

What I let me see if I can find my old model. Yeah. And and part of the reason, Drew, is that

### You (2025-05-14T21:33:57.438Z)

exit. The investment. So True. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:33:59.974Z)

you know, the investors don't really get to pick and choose when the asset's sold.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:01.978Z)

You got

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:04.044Z)

It's typically like a GP decision. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:04.138Z)

plus years.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:06.964Z)

you know, it's not like you can just decide when you wanna exit the investment. So True. Yeah. Is that a I think as far as, like, deciding what year to sell.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:14.528Z)

We expect a year by the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:17.174Z)

Yeah. I don't think that But but, typically, when when when an investor goes into a deal, they're basically buying an acquisition thesis. And the thesis is that we're buying this today.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:25.878Z)

you know, help determine what

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:26.874Z)

We're gonna spend the year renovating it. We're gonna spend four years operating. And then year five, we're gonna sell it.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:27.658Z)

sales should occur. So that would be just that seen that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:31.294Z)

So that's kind of

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:31.558Z)

But it's too good again. Yeah. I think I have I have a model that shows it that way.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:32.764Z)

part of the for but to your point, Drew, may be helped

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:36.568Z)

If I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:37.244Z)

to to, you know, help determine when

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:38.488Z)

find it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:39.354Z)

that sale should occur. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:40.758Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:41.054Z)

that could be interesting, although I've just I've never seen that done before, but it's a good idea.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:42.368Z)

We can always customize that. We get

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:44.654Z)

Yeah. I think I have I have a model that shows it that way.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:46.408Z)

So I think you are always throw key metrics on a

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:50.014Z)

If I can find it. Yeah. I'm in we can always customize that on the application level.

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:56.948Z)

important. To show this refinance

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:34:58.214Z)

So on the UI, we can

### You (2025-05-14T21:34:58.668Z)

because that that's a big part of how

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:00.914Z)

you know, always show the key metrics on the

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:01.528Z)

many investors get there. Returns

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:04.124Z)

top as Drew was

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:04.638Z)

through that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:05.674Z)

saying earlier.

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:07.218Z)

Decreasing debt.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:08.114Z)

But I do think it's important to show this refinance because that that's a big part of how many investors get there. Returns, you know, through that increase in debt.

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:22.758Z)

K. This.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:36.614Z)

Cool. And then, Howard, I was wondering

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:36.708Z)

That is in a bit you know.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:40.804Z)

this

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:41.338Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:41.914Z)

logic like cash on cash increasing, say, in your

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:41.958Z)

That's in fact. Yeah. Yeah. I I I there are some there are some things in this model that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:46.554Z)

2029. That is inbuilt

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:48.998Z)

weren't in the other one, so we'll have to take a look at it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:50.714Z)

in our model, or are we gonna have the logic with

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:51.418Z)

But it's it's all math. You know, the inputs,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:53.514Z)

that's inbuilt?

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:54.578Z)

that I see here are pretty much the same inputs that we have.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:35:56.714Z)

Got it. As mhmm.

### You (2025-05-14T21:35:58.158Z)

Yeah. There's just a simple calculation. In this this for? Sync the economy.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:06.394Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:06.938Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:08.524Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:09.888Z)

color here

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:11.524Z)

So

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:12.058Z)

is happening right

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:12.274Z)

in this case,

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:13.378Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:14.014Z)

all we have is this data for

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:15.588Z)

So, you know, I mean, this is exactly I know

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:16.944Z)

say, the current year

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:18.148Z)

how much work you did in ValuationIQ. Are you

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:19.144Z)

and then probably other financial data. And based on that, the calculation

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:21.328Z)

did you work in ValuationIQ at all?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:22.914Z)

is happening. Right?

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:24.718Z)

Okay. Alright. So that was, you know, the Excel model. This is is almost identical to this. So know, what what we had there

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:34.664Z)

Yeah. No. Not on my list, mate.

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:34.908Z)

we're basically what we're looking to do is to take Excel and bring it into non online app.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:36:39.734Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-14T21:36:41.608Z)

You know? So all of your since, you know, we're gonna have to have a lot of dynamic information here. Right? So if they only want a five year hold, we are gonna be five columns. Right? So we're there's gonna have to be some inputs that are based that'll that'll show what is displayed on the screen. But, yeah, we can we can do this year over year calculation. You know, it's all fairly standard commercial real estate underwriting metrics. Few different things. But yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's like, will it just logical things if we

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:20.994Z)

So

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:23.788Z)

probably

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:24.214Z)

And as far as I know, we don't need that.

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:24.278Z)

expect the sync. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:26.734Z)

To keep like, store that in database or anything. But that

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:26.778Z)

Yeah. And and this is why I thought, you know, we may wanna pre calculate

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:31.084Z)

It will be just

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:31.098Z)

some of these things.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:32.034Z)

logical based if we need to show it somewhere else.

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:33.788Z)

Cause you can see this is an awful lot of information, right? We don't want to have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:37:35.504Z)

Can probably extract the same logic.

### You (2025-05-14T21:37:38.458Z)

15 tabs showing across the screen. But we do wanna have you know, maybe we have a drop down where they can check what tabs do I want to see or or some type of a navigation before they can go through here. And that's what I'm working on right now. So so yeah. I mean, it's it's it's not it's not rocket science. It's just a maker

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:03.894Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:04.068Z)

getting it done. Right? So yeah. Yep. For so much. Other day with that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:13.974Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:14.968Z)

benefit.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:18.294Z)

Yeah. I think the way, Howard, you had it that you were showing us the other day with that of that panel is

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:22.908Z)

Yeah. Yeah. In fact, I've I've actually got it open here in front of me. I mean, I can

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:24.734Z)

you know, it it replicates the kind of the feel of tabs in Excel. Right? So it

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:29.678Z)

kinda show you where I'm

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:30.074Z)

it's the there's a flow to it, but it's also easier.

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:31.278Z)

going.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:32.744Z)

Easy to jump. Like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:32.758Z)

With this. But

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:33.924Z)

between the different sections.

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:37.808Z)

Not until Vinod, did you have any more questions or, Drew, anything you wanted to add?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:45.754Z)

You wanna you wanna screen share? You wanna think of the screen?

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:47.908Z)

Yeah. Model. Right? From here. You know, have some question. But for now, I think I'm Do you wanna have question? A phone call actually, but

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:38:57.714Z)

No. I I don't think so. As long as you got out of this what you needed.

### You (2025-05-14T21:38:58.638Z)

for Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:39:00.804Z)

Yeah. I think I'm good. I'll I'll have a look at this model, and I probably

### You (2025-05-14T21:39:02.038Z)

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, if if you want, I can go ahead and show you.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:39:05.744Z)

can have some questions. But for now, I think I'm It's been over. If you if you wanna have a follow-up call after you play with the model, I'm happy

### You (2025-05-14T21:39:08.088Z)

You. Just it'll take a couple minutes because it's not I'm not that far along here. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:39:11.274Z)

happy to jump on the phone with you. Great. Thank you very much.

### You (2025-05-14T21:39:14.438Z)

let me see if I want to okay. There we go. Share. Here. Alright. Are you able to see the PowerPoint? Okay. Is it is it large enough on the screen? Yeah. Okay. Alright. So this is kinda what I'm thinking of. And this is different. Vinod's been working on some navigation thing there. So we're kind of incorporating it. I added

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:39:51.704Z)

Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:39:55.688Z)

the logo he put on, but, this is what I showed the other day when you could click on the property details and then this modal pops up and you can put in the property name and everything else here, I we added census ID. We've got some other stuff that we wanna bring in here. So, yeah, this is where you could go then, you know, if you click on the investment assumptions, this expands, and you got the other choices down here. So, you know, you can input your acquisition, financing, disposition. And so what I wanna get away from is that 14 page carousel where you click on next, you click on next, it will happen here, but I also want to have the pages themselves, which today they are not links, but they they will be so. If I want to put in my property details, and then jump to know, maybe my CapEx or my expenses. Right? I all you have to do is click on the main category here and get there. This is what I was thinking about in terms of having some type of metrics. You know, we can choose, and it could be page specific. Right? May want to have one or two maybe that's visible on every screen. But, you know, here I am in I'm in my investment assumptions page. So I could have some metrics up here that are to those assumptions. Right? So which can then show what if I change some of those acquisitions or financing assumptions then you can watch everything up here. But, you know, if I'm down working in the market assumptions, I'm not really concerned about the financing type KPIs. Right? So that's kind of what I'm talking about there. If I jump to a different screen, which I haven't done yet, we could end up with different metrics. And it could be a card with a single metric like the what's showing in the green. Could also be the the hold period, like Drew, what you were talking about a few minutes ago where you know, you might want to have that whole hold period cash on cash return visible here. And as I make it change to an assumption, you know, maybe that's gonna change one of the years. Right? And you can see it happen in real time once you make that change. So the whole idea here is to keep this left navigation screen as clean as possible but make it easy to go wherever you wanna go. And so, you know, today, I I just added a couple things while we were talking here because I don't have a summary page on here. This was designed just for the inputs, but we'll have to have a summary. You know, we can add a waterfall. So you can click on these, go wherever you want to, and not have to go through that linear 14 step because I might wanna skip step seven through 10, right, and jump to 11. The way that we had it lined up before where you're kinda clicking next, next, next, really kind of prohibits us from doing that. So that was kind of Yeah. Yeah. So I think in the market data, well, this was this was not the star data. Right? This is so this this market

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:43:20.804Z)

So where where would the market data go? Like, the star data, would that go in market?

### You (2025-05-14T21:43:23.848Z)

penetration analysis. Okay. Yeah. So so yeah. And and this is just rough version one. Let's call it version zero. Right? So, yeah, we can we can do whatever we want

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:43:34.924Z)

Penetration. It's in penetration analysis. Okay.

### You (2025-05-14T21:43:37.438Z)

on here. In future versions, one other thing that I was thinking about is making this more role based as well. So a an asset manager or a lender may wanna have a little bit of a different view than a broker. Or an investor. Right? So when when the user logs in, when we onboard them, right, we're gonna know, are you a broker? Are you an investor? What are you? And then we'll have that information in the background so they'll know that when Howard logs in as an investor, he's going to have this information. When Vinod logs in as a asset manager, you know, he'll have different things available as well. So So what would happen, like this? Like, new program. You may not this stuff. So is there a couple of up feature? Well, like, maybe if you want to

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:36.714Z)

Well, also, Howard, like, what would happen, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:38.138Z)

make sure

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:40.754Z)

there may be, like, if you're forwarding this analysis to your appraiser,

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:42.928Z)

Yeah. So after your limit, information

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:44.974Z)

you may not want them to see all this stuff. So is there kind of like a lockout feature?

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:45.688Z)

flow? You wouldn't send them the actual model.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:49.574Z)

Like, may maybe you don't want the appraiser to see the capital budget

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:49.748Z)

I mean, we'll we'll have to differentiate between model sharing

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:53.134Z)

Maybe you don't want your lender to see their promote structure.

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:53.438Z)

in which case, you're just basically add giving

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:56.184Z)

So how could you limit

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:56.768Z)

permission for somebody to access this.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:44:58.034Z)

information flow

### You (2025-05-14T21:44:59.858Z)

Which means you know? And then we can set permission levels. Can they view it? Only, or can they change things? But when you're sending things out, that would be more of a report. Right? So that's something I need to add here. So yeah, I'll go down here and And what we talked about? How with some way you know, generate work, button. You would Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:30.234Z)

And what we talked about, Howard, to do that was

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:30.498Z)

You know, I want in know, I wanna add include

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:35.054Z)

basically the if you if there's a somewhere there's a, you know, like, a generate report or generate

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:36.638Z)

the three sections and not Yes. Yeah. So right now,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:40.964Z)

export button

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:41.908Z)

it's one interface

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:42.154Z)

you would then be able to pick

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:42.928Z)

one of that.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:43.904Z)

you know, I wanna in you know, I wanna

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:43.988Z)

I can accommodate any Right.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:46.774Z)

include in this report I'm generating. I wanna include

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:48.068Z)

Like, like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:49.984Z)

these three sections and not these three sections. Right?

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:51.628Z)

type of work.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:53.574Z)

So right. It's that way it's it's one interface, one process, but it can accommodate any

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:54.378Z)

But Exactly. Would investment return fall under?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:45:58.574Z)

any potential

### You (2025-05-14T21:45:59.028Z)

Right now, it's under investment assumptions, but

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:01.374Z)

like, like, any any potential, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:03.328Z)

Yeah. We we we look at that for

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:05.104Z)

type of report you wanna create versus

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:05.898Z)

returns just because that's obviously

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:07.134Z)

user. But, like, to to Mark's point. And and, Howard, where would you where would investment returns fall under? Like, in which tab?

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:09.228Z)

in returns, you'd want go up like matrix. So you know, you make 20,000,100 and returns. We did.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:16.594Z)

Yeah. So you may wanna have a separate tab for returns just because that's obviously a big

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:18.258Z)

You know, if you have 60%, like, versus 70% leverage,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:21.404Z)

because typically in returns,

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:22.128Z)

Yeah. Have it return

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:23.584Z)

you'd wanna develop, a matrix. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:24.228Z)

Good. Have to spend 20,000,000 versus 25,000,000,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:26.094Z)

if you pay 20,000,000, what are the returns? If you pay 25,000,000, what are the returns?

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:27.848Z)

in capital improvements. So so there's lots of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:30.264Z)

And then you may wanna put in

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:30.618Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:31.844Z)

you know, if you have 60% leverage versus 70% leverage,

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:34.178Z)

to kind of serve

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:35.544Z)

how does that impact returns?

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:35.598Z)

formula is for the acquisition. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:37.564Z)

You know, if you spend 20,000,000 versus 25,000,000 on capital improvements, there's there's lots of variables

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:37.828Z)

So there's a couple things we could do with that. Maybe a combination of them. So I would say

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:43.574Z)

that ultimately the investor wants to play with

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:44.788Z)

as part of the summary tab,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:46:46.994Z)

to kinda determine what the right formula is for the acquisition.

### You (2025-05-14T21:46:47.628Z)

just like you had a like, what, maybe a dozen different sections on that Excel page for the summary, those could be subsections under here just like, you know, under the investment assumptions, we have three different areas I go down here to the expense page, you know, we've got you know, six or seven different sections there. So we could do the same thing with the summary as well. But, also, some of those metrics or some of those summary items, you you know, talking about your returns, maybe that is one of the metrics that we show on every page. Right? Yeah. You know, wanna do a sensitivity. Yeah. To see what change. Variables. Right. Thing about expenses is that you know, some expenses are formulaic. We've just broken it by two, three, 45%.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:39.314Z)

Yeah. But but, again, the returns are typically you know, you wanna do a sensitivity

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:40.418Z)

A year. Yeah. But then, you know, things like taxes and insurance,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:43.474Z)

to see what changing variables

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:43.548Z)

often require a deeper dive. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:45.894Z)

will do. Another thing on expenses is that

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:46.098Z)

So you wanna you know, benchmark.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:48.994Z)

you know, some expenses are formulaic where you're just growing them by two, three,

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:49.158Z)

Prob is what I mean. So we've been able to set up to have

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:52.824Z)

four, 5% a year.

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:53.188Z)

what detail. Pages

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:54.254Z)

But then, you know, things like taxes and insurance,

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:55.168Z)

for types of expenses.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:56.914Z)

often require a deeper dive

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:57.748Z)

That have Yes. Focused more

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:47:59.114Z)

So you wanna

### You (2025-05-14T21:47:59.848Z)

Yeah. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:00.954Z)

know, benchmark against comparable properties. You wanna be able to do a calculation. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:01.508Z)

You know. Next person. Increase. Taxes or, like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:04.634Z)

we may wanna set up to have more detailed

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:04.908Z)

big deal. Really wanna scrutinize that. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:07.464Z)

pages

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:07.958Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:08.494Z)

for the

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:08.648Z)

That looks nice

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:09.854Z)

types of expenses that investors typically focus more on.

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:10.848Z)

from a analytical perspective. Yeah. No. You're right.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:13.464Z)

Right? Like, a and g is, you know,

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:13.908Z)

There's there's different ways of of setting that up. So

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:15.424Z)

x percent of your increase. Taxes are, like, a big deal, and you really wanna scrutinize that. So

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:17.438Z)

again, this is version zero. I I know that there's probably plenty of things missing from here.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:21.294Z)

you know, not all expenses are created equal.

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:24.018Z)

The important thing is

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:24.154Z)

From an analytical perspective.

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:25.388Z)

what do It's a great start. Yeah. What do we need on day one when we're just going out to show us a proof of concept? It's like, you know, your your example is good. We have to have a page that says taxes and insurance.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:48:38.004Z)

It's a great start.

### You (2025-05-14T21:48:39.068Z)

We don't necessarily have to make it even a functioning page. You know? We can go out there and, you know, we we just we'll wanna show that we've got this under consideration. This is going to be on here, like, the waterfall. Mean, there's so many different ways to calculate a waterfall. That's one thing I'm thinking of. You know? Going to have to, like, funnel Right? Start at a high level and say, okay. Well, are you using this type of waterfall or this type and, you know, and then kinda narrow it down? But yeah. I mean, everything that you're saying in can be done. Right? It's it's not we're not inventing anything new here. What we're doing is just trying to take what we have and make it in a easier process. Surgery. Yeah. Process. To version one. Yeah. I think we wanna the full range

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:37.714Z)

Yeah. User friendly way.

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:38.478Z)

of four gs. Know, as fast as we can.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:39.954Z)

But but I agree with you. I I think the right approach is to just show that

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:40.538Z)

Absolutely. And they just say, you like, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:43.534Z)

the pages we intend to build out, we don't necessarily have to build everything up for version one.

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:43.698Z)

these. First half pages, but we have another 20 pages. To develop over the next six months.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:47.774Z)

But I think we wanna just show users that we've thought about

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:49.448Z)

Yeah. And, you know, we can always have, like, little bits of functionality, like

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:50.894Z)

the full range of or as many things as we possibly can And then just say, you know, I'm just like, you know, coming soon. Like, we've developed these

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:54.968Z)

you know, we do need to have a a matrix. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:49:57.624Z)

first 10 pages, but we have another 20 pages to develop over the next

### You (2025-05-14T21:49:57.948Z)

That's that's basic information that we had before. So we'd have a risk matrix based

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:50:00.864Z)

six months or whatever the case may be.

### You (2025-05-14T21:50:04.248Z)

on cap rates. Another matrix based on financing. You know, what happens if interest rates jump up half a percentage or you know, cap rates go down lower? So that that's pretty easy stuff. And and even for that, we could have, know, like, a drop down list. Choose your cap rate or choose and we can have it so it actually works on the screen. But it's not gonna be nearly as sophisticated as it would be in the final model. But when we're talking to, you know, potential investors and we're talking to potential users right out of the gate you know, we're on the same page. We have to have something that at least they can get an idea that, number one, we're aware of it. Number two, it's in process. And number three, we'll we'll we'll get it working here in a in in a future iteration. So Yep. Sense. This. So we start showing these methods as soon as they user. Collecting the

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:51:15.264Z)

Makes sense.

### You (2025-05-14T21:51:15.958Z)

these you if you go back to the version that we're using

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:51:18.394Z)

I mean, I'm just thinking that this metrics, right, this is

### You (2025-05-14T21:51:19.838Z)

there is a matrix on the summary page.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:51:21.564Z)

part of the deal creation flow. We start showing this metrics as soon as the user

### You (2025-05-14T21:51:24.628Z)

But you may not have all of the inputs

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:51:27.284Z)

creating the deal.

### You (2025-05-14T21:51:28.058Z)

available. Right? But, yeah, there's there's there's some things that you could do fairly quickly.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:51:34.174Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-14T21:51:36.848Z)

But, yeah, there's it it depends on which order they walk around. So, you know, you don't want to have a matrix available right after they click on property details right Do have financing information in there. You will have to have cap rate assumptions and all these different things, but but, yeah, that those those tables are very, very important. But when they so it's probably then we have all this data. Upfront. Right? You have the historical data.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:52:15.494Z)

Yeah. But when the user is

### You (2025-05-14T21:52:17.118Z)

Right? But

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:52:18.514Z)

pulling the deal from the database,

### You (2025-05-14T21:52:18.608Z)

things like with the cap rates, you're making an assumption of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:52:20.944Z)

we have all this data upfront. Right?

### You (2025-05-14T21:52:23.158Z)

what do I think the cap rates are gonna be seven years now. If you're holding it for seven. If you're if you're trying to calculate your exit

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:52:29.654Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:52:31.398Z)

you think the property is gonna be worth in seven years. So no. You're you're you're not gonna be able to get all the information we need from from Drew, if that's what you're referring to. Yeah. Push it up. Right. Right. So historical information. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:52:54.334Z)

Yeah. Not all, for sure.

### You (2025-05-14T21:52:56.148Z)

So question for Mark and Drew then. On that historical information, typically, how many years back do they go? Do you typically just get one year, the prior year? Do you get five years of historical? Is it Typically. You know, typically, what tip typically. Is we define recycle, Okay. But what we're seeing now, just wanna see if they before COVID. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:23.504Z)

Yeah. I mean, typically,

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:25.568Z)

Yeah. So that's the to be a turn away. Thinking about these

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:28.384Z)

you know, to the work tip typical gets redefined every cycle.

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:29.118Z)

deals. Yeah. I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:31.954Z)

But what we're seeing now is that people generally wanna see things before COVID.

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:33.728Z)

two thousand

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:35.964Z)

During COVID, and the post COVID recovery. So that seems to be the current way of thinking about these deals.

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:42.638Z)

I think that too.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:44.864Z)

I would feel like you know, maybe it's like

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:45.878Z)

I years. History. Like,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:47.294Z)

02/1819, right, pre COVID,

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:47.578Z)

got me in my head. Even get it. It might get more.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:50.354Z)

like, the COVID years and then the recovery. So people are looking at things longer now than they have

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:50.388Z)

But I would say that's like, standard number.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:54.994Z)

historically.

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:55.008Z)

Years. History. From the crisis.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:56.074Z)

I think I would say, like, allow, like,

### You (2025-05-14T21:53:56.768Z)

Year.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:53:57.934Z)

ten years of history. Like, you not you might not always get it, but And you might get more, but I would say that's, like, a a tip I think, like, a standard number of years of history

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:05.328Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, yesterday, I did some deep research

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:54:09.354Z)

from the current year that users would like, nobody would expect

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:11.958Z)

using using some, some of the tools there.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:54:13.564Z)

nobody's gonna be disappointed

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:14.978Z)

And all I wanted to do is, you know, I just asked, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:54:15.104Z)

if you don't have more than ten.

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:18.568Z)

how many

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:54:18.604Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:19.648Z)

hotel hospitality transactions

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:54:21.834Z)

Is that too much?

### You (2025-05-14T21:54:22.828Z)

have occurred by quarter each year for the last six years and what were the dollar volumes of those? And one thing I noticed is in 2024, I think there was, like, almost 400 transactions that came up from this particular source. But in 2019 and 2020, or 2020 and '21, it was, like, less than 80, I think it was. Mean so so, yeah, that's such a huge differential between those you know, COVID years and and where we're back now. And I don't even know how 2024 compares to pre COVID. You know? How many transactions we were looking at that fund. Just looked at some data. That a trend. File. Financial financing. In the quarter twenty five. So it seems like there's a activity is is increasing quite a bit. Yeah. And, yeah, some

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:19.964Z)

It's I just looked at some data. There was a tremendous amount of

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:23.318Z)

You know?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:23.734Z)

hotel financing

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:23.828Z)

We kinda

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:25.124Z)

in the first quarter of twenty five.

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:25.408Z)

stick stay

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:27.584Z)

So seems like transaction activity is increasing quite a bit.

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:31.138Z)

Yeah. But

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:32.714Z)

And, you know, assuming the you know, the economy stays stays afloat, it went through recession. I I think that, you know, activity should

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:38.138Z)

see right, There you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:42.624Z)

should remain pretty strong.

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:43.188Z)

a

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:44.164Z)

But and it's also right, of

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:48.728Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:49.654Z)

the transactions you see

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:50.878Z)

And and and actually

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:55:52.164Z)

right, there's probably you know, like, a typical company is gonna look at you know, if you look at a hundred transactions, for 10 you know, for every 10 transactions you look at, you know,

### You (2025-05-14T21:55:58.768Z)

at

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:00.794Z)

actually close on one. And and any given transaction is gonna end

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:04.308Z)

Right. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:06.124Z)

a dozen or more different groups looking at it,

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:07.028Z)

So it's not just it's just not just like with this. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:08.884Z)

Right? So, thankfully, we're not the the TAM is not just number of transactions that that happen. Right? There's a a much broader TAM that were

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:17.848Z)

To the monitor.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:19.184Z)

that we're trying to capture. And it's also it's it's not just it's just not just acquisitions.

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:21.298Z)

Refined it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:23.494Z)

Right? Financing is gonna be a big part of it also. Yeah. And then the and and the whole

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:25.598Z)

Yeah. No. I I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:27.134Z)

hope is that, you know, if we get people using this for new acquisitions, they continue to use it

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:27.778Z)

just things like typically, we have to get from the very

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:31.594Z)

to monitor investment performance over time and do refinancing and

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:31.668Z)

updates every year. Right? So, hopefully, this will be a tool that's used for you know,

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:36.084Z)

dispositions, quarterly valuation,

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:36.168Z)

forging and reporting to investors you know, there should be lots of

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:38.054Z)

market update? Etcetera? And also just just things like routine things, like like

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:40.518Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Admittedly, I

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:43.324Z)

typically, borrowers have to give lenders updates every year.

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:43.518Z)

I only looked at one metric. How many deals changed hands?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:46.834Z)

Right? So, hopefully, this will become the tool that's used for

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:47.778Z)

But, yeah, you're right. I mean, multi filling is the same way. We've got people who would

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:56:49.364Z)

you know, reporting and reporting to investors and you know, there should be lots of different applications.

### You (2025-05-14T21:56:52.458Z)

underwrite 20 and close on two. And and so, yeah, I I there's gonna be way more data going through our system than than just how many But just yeah. Has longer activity hotels get finance the time. So that lots of transactional

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:57:15.704Z)

But again, I'm not a multifamily expert, so I could be off base. But I think multifamily

### You (2025-05-14T21:57:16.068Z)

opportunity. Yeah. I think to a certain extent, yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:57:20.134Z)

typically has longer loans

### You (2025-05-14T21:57:20.988Z)

You know, it's it's usually

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:57:22.474Z)

Hotels are typically financed for two or three years, so the

### You (2025-05-14T21:57:22.598Z)

interest only for five years and then they have to refi. I mean, yeah, I think the loan

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:57:25.874Z)

hotels get refinanced all the time, so there's lots of transactional

### You (2025-05-14T21:57:29.448Z)

and typically, I mean, it's it's amortized on a thirty year or

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:57:30.014Z)

opportunities.

### You (2025-05-14T21:57:33.948Z)

or twenty year, typically. And interest only for the first five. So you're right. There's a lot of different I'm I'm sure a lot of different financing options between the two. This for me, has been very helpful. So, Mark, I appreciate you putting this together and helping out. Thank you. Yeah. It's my pleasure. I'll send you out call when they you know, if you don't want it. You know, Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:05.264Z)

Yeah. You me.

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:05.798Z)

Thank you. Howard, I see it.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:08.774Z)

Yeah. Thank you. You know, it's my pleasure. I'll send around the model and that

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:10.388Z)

Howard, Yeah. Howard, one?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:13.504Z)

if you guys wanna jump on another call,

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:14.118Z)

bottom side?

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:19.834Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:24.454Z)

AI companion. AI companion. It's

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:26.408Z)

I I have not. No. But I I I do see that

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:30.454Z)

on the bottom side. On Zoom.

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:31.748Z)

fireflies recorded that I'm surprised because I I actually

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:37.594Z)

Yeah. I don't know whether you have used it.

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:41.328Z)

stopped that. I didn't I didn't know whose it was, which which is good. Yeah. I I wanted to make sure we had a recording of this so that Vinod and I can

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:58:49.624Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-14T21:58:51.578Z)

go back and rewatch per portions if we have questions. And I I was gonna use Teams to record it, but luckily, fireflies is here, though. I don't know if it's gonna record

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:59:00.164Z)

We didn't mark.

### You (2025-05-14T21:59:03.798Z)

video, though. I think it might just take notes. So we'll see. But yeah. I mean, if we have any questions, we can reach out. Alright. Anything else? Thank you. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-14T21:59:28.054Z)

Nice. Nothing from my side. Thank you very much. Alright. Thanks, guys. Talk soon. Take care. Bye. Bye.
