# Transcript for: MVP and Funding Strategy for InnVestAI Product Development

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:01:48.156Z)

So Hey, guys.

### You (2025-07-15T21:01:50.244Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:01:52.496Z)

Hey.

### You (2025-07-15T21:01:59.604Z)

How are you doing today? Doing alright.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:02:01.626Z)

Good. I am good. How are you? Thank you for sending over the latest

### You (2025-07-15T21:02:07.984Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:02:10.966Z)

version of the AVM.

### You (2025-07-15T21:02:12.794Z)

Yeah. Getting there. Just want to finish that summary page over the next couple of days and then we need to talk to the node about how soon we think we can turn it around into an MVP. But I I think so far, it's going pretty well.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:02:42.446Z)

And just to I mean, maybe we'll talk about this more when Mark is on as well. But the MVP versus, you know, POC is I guess, is it is the MVP the it's supposed to be not just demo ready, but like, sellable ready. Is that the intent, or is there an is that

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:07.784Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:09.156Z)

work or is it

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:09.464Z)

Yeah. Enough of a core product to where somebody will get a good idea of exactly how it's gonna work. So so, yeah, POC is just internal. Us. Testing it. You know, you can you can use the the link that I've set out to everybody and get in there.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:30.816Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:32.234Z)

But the MVP is when we have anybody outside of the five of us that need to log in and test it. That's that's when we'll have authentication.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:39.096Z)

Log in and test it and touch it.

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:41.444Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:44.066Z)

Right, versus just see it.

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:44.714Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:46.636Z)

Right? We might theoretically be showing the POC to others, but not they're not gonna be using it.

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:52.654Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:03:53.506Z)

And and the m and the MVP is I guess, maybe most importantly, it is the

### You (2025-07-15T21:03:58.534Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:04:00.206Z)

the actual foundation upon which everything else will be built. So it's we've moved away from scooter. We're now building the the the the car, so to speak.

### You (2025-07-15T21:04:09.314Z)

And there's a little bit of increments between the scooter and the car, but yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:04:12.676Z)

Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-15T21:04:13.834Z)

Yeah. No. You no. You're right.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:04:17.246Z)

Just Howard and I had two calls last week with just two very good friends of mine near Liebling because I worked with Nir at Waterton for so many years. And Kara Munn, because she and I worked together, at CBRE, and she's debt and structure finance and an attorney. She just looks at it from a different perspective. The I I mean, they there's a little bit of improvement to do, but I think the POC demo went well. And better than I would have anticipated Howard and I doing on a very first try that was unscripted or unpracticed. However, you and you could tell if you have a different opinion.

### You (2025-07-15T21:04:56.974Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:04:57.936Z)

I don't you know, totally understand, but I just

### You (2025-07-15T21:04:59.004Z)

I think I it was very well received.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:05:01.346Z)

need it it Like, people can see the opportunity. They can see, like, oh, given what we're learning about AI, this is real. Right? Howard made the point on both demos that AI does a particularly good job with financial analysis. Right? So that sells into the story that now is the right time. And then just a lot of interest, think, on the potential of the product. That's that's good to hear. Yeah. Is is Mark joining? Or is he I think he's joining. I feel like we did this at five. Well, we did it on Tuesday for him, and then I think he knows about it because, Drew, we talked about it earlier today when we spoke with him. Alright. Let me just text him. And just so you guys know I I mean, Mark and I will make no qualms about this. We're just deferring a opinions at at what level you can start to show potential investors if it's POC or if it's MVP. And we're trying to figure out some sort of compromise between our positions on it. I've Yeah. I think the sort of what we just what we kinda agreed upon or came to is that I guess, wanted to ask you guys what is the fastest and like, I guess, how much money and time does it take would it take to to take what we've done so far and build it into the the MVP. Right? Like, the most let me how do I phrase this? Mark Mark feels like we need something more more robust, more polished. He he he's stuck in a meeting. So he said it so I'll basically, what you're saying is he feels like we need something more robust, more polished, to take to anybody that we are going to ask to potentially, you know, use the system as a customer, right, or to give us money. Right? So which may you know, he may be right. He may be wrong. I think, Diane, to your point that your POC you know, using POC to do your demo went really well. That's promising. But regardless, we wanna know what is like, how much money and time would it take to to develop the POC? Because that's because I mean, regardless VP. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because we're gonna need we're gonna need money, right, sooner rather than later. And so you know, obviously, we could go try to ask for a huge chunk of money to last the next two years, which seems unlikely. You know? Or we could find, you know, what's the smallest amount of money for the shortest amount of time to get it to you know, the kind of next stage of where we can start to take this customer and have them use it. Maybe not pay for it, but use it, and then that will be the gateway to getting an agent. Like, so it's Mark's angel investor friends to And then we also backed into potential. So compromise solution, which is if we took between between today and Labor Day and put our heads down, how much money would you and Veno need to get it? On web hosting to get the tools Vinod needs? To put a little bit of time together And if, say, that came to 10 k or just I'm I'm just totally making up a number. Is that something we could figure how to fund between Drew and Mark, maybe another idea And then wherever we land, on September for at Labor Day, is what we go out with. Because we then need to start to spend our time talking to friends and family and you know, investors. So I think right right, Drew? Did I get that? That was, like, an ending comment on it. Like, if we set our sights that you know, summer's a slow time. Right? And people don't do a lot of things, But come September 1, everyone jumps back into full action. So if we, meaning, like, Drew and Mark and I were prepared with possible customer list, possible investor list, possible friends and family list, and we just needed to hit it really hard from a networking and fundraising perspective. What product could we achieve by Labor Day realistically given funding constraints, the nodes time constraints, but maybe the ability to engage a junior designer to help out a little bit. Oh, hey, Fanode. You're on camera. Yeah. Yeah. So I think first thing is closing down on what exact features we want to develop for MVP. Based on that, we can decide on the budget and the timeline. Right? So if we can just close out on the features, then it could be easier for both budgeting and timelines. Alright. Well, then let's jump into that your Jira list, Howard. Right? That's what we were gonna

### You (2025-07-15T21:10:46.624Z)

Yeah. But Diane sent out the budget. I think I think most of the stuff on the Jira list is beyond the MVP. And so I think what we need to do is we we need to continue looking at that AI list and let's narrow that down. So the node from a product standpoint I think what we're looking for the MVP, is basically the same functionality that we have in the POC plus document processing. Which could you know, be part of that AI plus what we talked about possibly just having the the ability to press a button to get a generated or an AI generated report Let's just let's just talk about that for now. And then to Diane and Drew regarding whether we need a POC or an MVP for funding. I could provide a ton of articles and books about the fact that it's recommended to not even waste anybody's time on an MVP unless you've got a POC that you've already presented to investors. Investors, they're not going to be using the tool. Some of them might be. Right? I I know you've got some identified that are that are in the industry. That could also be users.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:12:35.976Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-15T21:12:36.984Z)

But the ones who aren't users but in grasp the concept. The POC is all you need. In fact, you know, some of them say even a slide deck is all you need to get started. So I don't think you know, and I and I've mentioned before, I don't think we need to wait for an MVP before we sit down with anybody. You know, we can we can pick and choose the ones that we think we can talk to first. But like I said, the the reception that we're getting on these calls the POC is to the point where anybody gets it. Right? They can they can see how it works. They're gonna get what the tool does. And what we don't have, we can still mock up. We can we can put things in this POC that are not functional. But and and we don't try to truth. Fool anybody. We we'd let them know this is this is where we're heading And then know, I could mock up a a a report that's generated I could even use, like, the one that I generated before with the Avenue of the Arts or something like that. When you're talking about somebody who is just going to write a check to invest in an idea you can do that from the POC.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:14:08.026Z)

And, Drew, you've I mean, just you were telling your experience that you had a different experience But that might be because you were Mine again. Yeah. Mine is starting a one man show. Yeah. Yeah. Very Right. Very different. My experience might be the exception that proves the rule, to speak, because I was team of one, and I did not own the technology and, you know, variety of other things. But so I was sort of in you know, the the opposite the inverse of where I of where we are and where I probably should have been. I guess, if we Howard, tried to go that road, I mean, I guess the question one of the questions that is like, how much money are we asking for

### You (2025-07-15T21:15:02.794Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:15:04.436Z)

upfront. Right? I'm guessing like, I I I have heard about and, Diane, I know you said the same that you can go to an investor if you have a you know, theoretically say, my idea is worth $5,000,000. Therefore, give me 2,000,000 to get it started, and I'll give you 40%. Again, that was not the case. Like, I did not have that experience at all. Like, not like, people were, like, Right. And if you're rock star If I could just jump in, I feel like everything I've read about this says you put your twenty four month, like, true pre seed capital budget together. And then that is plus if you have a strong founding team, and they know how you're gonna spend the money and there's a clear path to monetization that they can understand, That they will look at your twenty four month budget and say this represents 10 to 15% ownership in the company. And that's like a metric that's used because we I mean, we're probably gonna set a very realistic yet low year one ARR goal. We're gonna need to get in and find some clients to, like, test and test and test and test and test. Right? It'd be better to have three big clients than 60 small clients Because if we have some enterprise client, they'll just be I think we'll have a better chance of getting our reps under us. Right? Reps. Reps. Reps. Reps. To to totally prove what we can do. And so I guess in my mind, I just have a view we could get to a handful of enterprise clients in year one doing pilots for us to get to a simple number around 200 k in ARR. And then we set our goals between year three and five that we have to ramp to 30 to 50, which is huge, but this industry is huge. Then that's when you back in and say, okay. Is it the two year number of 2 to $3,000,000 of pre seed funding is it worth 10 to 15% of the company? And I don't know another way to do it other than bootstrapping. And and I just don't see that many companies that bootstrap this. But but again, you guys like this as well as I do. Right?

### You (2025-07-15T21:17:22.404Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:17:23.376Z)

That's what I did. But it's typical.

### You (2025-07-15T21:17:24.464Z)

And and don't misunderstand me. I mean, they're not every opportunity apply is to every I mean, or every rule applies to this. Right? So one of the things I think, first off, Diane, we doubled the amount of the salary on there for for the four of us. You you put in on on your budget The nodes you put in for six months, the other ones you put in for a full twelve months. So we're $96,000 over budgeted on that. We can make that correction. But I think what I'm saying is I'm looking before the pre seed. Somebody who could come in either in place of Drew and Marx contribution or maybe in addition to I'm talking about, you know, another 20 to $50,000. Those are the people that we can sell to with a POC. Yeah, I'm not I'm not talking about the long run two year budget thing. Right? So I would just wanna clarify that.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:18:30.926Z)

Okay. With and you're you said, like, 50, like, $50,000 that sort of order of magnitude?

### You (2025-07-15T21:18:40.784Z)

I'm I'm pulling a number out of the air because that's what we've talked about. No. I I would I would I mean, I would think, you know, if we could get combined funding of, you know, a 100 k, that'll get us probably through the end of the year now that we have to talk about compensation on that. But I'm talking about everything basically from Diane's budget from that's below the below the compensation. And not necessarily including all of the marketing and sales. But, I mean, we would have to have some of that. To to start getting a foot in the door, but yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:19:20.136Z)

Yeah. Yes. Just trying to think about how we would go about getting that Mark sounds like he doesn't wanna go to his own angel investor group.

### You (2025-07-15T21:19:38.334Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:19:40.336Z)

You know, not yet anyway. I mean, there are I mean, again, like, I said, I I did not have any luck going to, like, Do you know high-tech? Highgate, Tech Ventures. Cove Capital, others didn't even bother with Alpine. However, you know, this is a completely different thing. You know, maybe it's worth maybe it's worth, talking to some of these groups There are a handful of them that, you know they're not angel. They're they're venture capital. So I don't know if if it's their kind of thing, but we could always ask. Right? Like and you could and if we could get one company to be a sponsor, like, to to say, like, look. We'll we'll back the whole thing. Not for not all of the money, you know, that we would have for two years, but, like, you know, we'll we'll we'll back your whole 100 k for the first six months or a year or whatever. In exchange for something. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-15T21:20:40.804Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:20:43.206Z)

mean, that would be Reduced fees. I I mean, like, if I if

### You (2025-07-15T21:20:43.694Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:20:46.706Z)

I mean, I'll do I mean, I know I use them all the time and I it's just I've spent a year and a half trying to build a relationship with Driftwood. So they may say, hell no. Right? But I really think given how now that I know them, if it's a no, it'll be a no for now. Right? But if we could say, would you come in a 100 k for the first six months and help us get to the point where then we can really start to go to pre seed investors A 100 gets us to January. We knock out all the sales and marketing expenses because Drew I I guess you're right. I mean, we know these people. Right? And maybe we don't really have a viable MVP until the January to start showing them. We include the the web hosting costs, the tech tech costs. We've already paid most of the incorporation costs. And we include some amount of compensation so we can at least pay our rent and our mortgages. If that gets I'm gonna guess that gets us to, like, 75 k, a 100 k. And Driftwood did this with Revere, They were one of four industry users that partner to help Revere get off the ground. So so, I mean, that's that is an idea. Another group that we haven't I haven't really brought up that much is Ryman. Ryman is an investor in Fifth Wall. Right? I mean, they believe very much in technology. And so because they're an investor in fifth wall, maybe they would be interested in backing something like this. May maybe not as much money, but they they could be an option. And I don't think they're very predatory, Like, I was thinking about MCR, but I've been warned by enough people now that MCR might not be a good choice because might just take the idea and run with it without us. And those are two ideas that I have. Right? Yeah. And it could be I mean, maybe we I mean, you could go back to Carlton. At Actable. Right? Like, I mean, what I mean, caught up with him Wait. Well, you do have you caught up with him recently? No. No. His suggestion to me the last we talked was that I should form a team and do this on our own. So we've done that. Right? And I don't know. I mean, would they I don't I don't know if they would give us a little bit of money. I they seem really tight when it comes to money. So I don't know if they would, but

### You (2025-07-15T21:23:25.634Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:23:27.006Z)

hold on. What did you say, Howard? Did I not did I talk over you?

### You (2025-07-15T21:23:29.634Z)

No. I was we've we've been talking about the POC and everything, and I forgot to post

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:23:32.656Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-15T21:23:34.604Z)

the new URL. It's a it's a different URL for the site. So

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:23:37.826Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-15T21:23:38.314Z)

sorry. No. I was just trying to sneak that in on the chat.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:23:43.226Z)

But, Diane, I agree. Yeah. I agree. I mean, actable They they're yeah. But you're not trained. Well, think it's budget constrained. And a lot of these companies, they don't if they're gonna buy something, they'd rather buy somewhat more established product and they'd buy the whole thing. They wouldn't buy Gideon Investment. I feel like the what you talked about with Ruvere and, you know, having, like, Driftwood and a couple of other groups providing, you know, collectively you know, the seed capital basically to to start something is more likely than Alpine or Cove or Actable or any of these groups. Giving giving the same. Because, right, every time I've talked to these group, the Starwood Capital has a tech venture arm, and they're like, look. We not gonna do less than a million, and, like, we're not gonna invest in something that, like, we're gonna write a check, it's gonna be for a million or more. And, it you know, it's, it's just not worth their time otherwise. And it's and they would prefer for it to be for the entire company. Not for a piece of it. So, you know, high gate Tech Ventures, was a bit I can't remember it. It's a long time ago that I talked to them, but it was And I know I know that marketing sign foolish about approaching highgate, but they're they're cap they're deal junkies. Right? This product is built for deal makers, and that's why I do see some difference because if and if I can just say this, like, in the world of investment management, asset management is like a b player. It I mean and Yeah. Right? And the deal guys make the decisions. They run the companies. They want the tools. This is a product that the our our perceived product that I'm taking, it's it's part deal path and and part of a better version of Red IQ. Right? Like, that's a tool for deal junkies. Yeah. Right? Why is that so true top manager? Did Mark say don't talk to highgate? He talked to Highgate with Pinktata and he doesn't think that Rick he thinks we're too early to get Rick excited about it on the on the deal side. That Rick will blow us off and product isn't crisp enough to show him to get him excited about it. I kind of take an approach that if you go to them and you say, look. We're at the POC. Right? We're custom building this. For people like Highgate. So help us get to an MVP that is completely what you want. Versus us building an MVP that might be what you want. But but that but that that's how Mark feels about Highgate. And Highgate's too important of an industry player for us to disagree about how to approach them. Right? And I I don't have strong relationships there. I I mean, I can think of of I'm I'm I'm thinking about a handful of more groups. I do think Fulcrum could be a player here. When I see how Revere raised its capital with those four companies, those four companies were competitive. I mean, they were competitors of each other. Right? It's just they they saw an industry solution and decided to join force on it. And then the last thing I'll say, and then I'm gonna turn it back over to you guys on the technical side, is that I have not done this yet. But if I put my head down for two weeks, and explore every female oriented funding opportunity that might give us options that we haven't considered with one female cofounder, it could open some doors that I haven't even started to research yet. So that's an idea as well. That's true. Mean, if we were gonna go to if we were to try for like, you know, two, three, four groups like, I mean, Driftwood and god. Was it the Atlanta based what am I thinking of? Peachtree. Peachtree Group, Mhmm. And fulcrum and and, like, one other, like Right. I mean, Yeah. I mean, Dave I mean, Davidson might even put in a tiny little bit if if I can convince them that they we wanna manage, make company to be on the ground floor of this too because it's a product built for them as much as it is for them to do deals right, to win contracts. Maybe they would put a little bit and not a lot, but maybe a little bit. Yeah. Did you talk to did you talk to Steve Marble last week? We were scheduled last Friday, but, Steve, it was Friday at 03:00, and Steve had a family conflict So we're rescheduling because Steve wants to be there, which makes me feel good. He's not just passing the buck to Tom Deshay. Yeah. And I I need Steve for the buy the real buy in. Know, here. Yeah. No. Anyway, I keep rambling, and I'm sorry, you guys. I keep rambling and rambling and rambling about I just like, I'm gonna tell you, I don't financially survive until January without some way to pay for my house and feed my kids. And it's been this has been a five year project for me where CBRE basically paid me nothing while I spent two years researching this. And then I spent a year Portman only to have this massive reduction in force. Right? And and so, like, I've I'm I'm totally tapped at this point. And I need this. So I can't I can't be you know, can't beat around the bush about this. I need some way to be able to support my family in this And when I was working that contract job, it was great, but it really was fifty hours a week for a part time contract job, and it left me virtually no time to spend on anything. Like this. Yep. So that's it. I'm just jumping off my pity party. And let's get back to what we need. Because, like, I think what we need to say is with, call it, 10 k and the September 1 deadline, Howard, you were saying, look at the AI. Right? And it's the same functionality as the POC,

### You (2025-07-15T21:30:29.544Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:30:30.516Z)

with document and processing.

### You (2025-07-15T21:30:33.264Z)

It could be just a deal overview

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:30:33.466Z)

Plus a button for generated report.

### You (2025-07-15T21:30:36.654Z)

It could be a market overview. It could be both. I mean, those are just very simple We could put in a can to prompt into into the code where it just says, you know, here's the deal name, city, state, etcetera, Pull up comps, tax records, whatever, like I did with the one, or it could just be know, here's the deal with all of the data that they've input into their Tell me, you know, is there any place where I can improve this? Or provide a summary overview or an investment package, something like that. It's nothing nothing we would have to do.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:31:20.996Z)

Mhmm. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-15T21:31:21.754Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:31:23.006Z)

Even what you what you did the other couple of weeks ago when, you know, we were talking about the other day, you know, like, Ask AI to generate a summary of you know, of of a property I can't remember what it was you prompted it to do, but it's, you know, property where you used stay,

### You (2025-07-15T21:31:35.344Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:31:38.396Z)

provided some really useful information. Right? If we were to make that a canned thing that that another button on the left side of the of the portal, right, where a user could

### You (2025-07-15T21:31:50.724Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:31:51.686Z)

you know, they put in their property name and it populates all that information. That that would be mean, I'm just some could also do that themselves by just going to ChatGPT, but but I think, you know, show showing that it's it's inside the system, I think, demonstrates what

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:01.944Z)

One

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:03.146Z)

we're going for. So

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:04.554Z)

no. I I was gonna I was gonna say there is one more thing that we haven't

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:05.996Z)

I guess so

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:08.264Z)

discussed yet that I I just

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:09.056Z)

go ahead.

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:10.254Z)

remembered is we still have to create the pipeline page as well. Which is basically just a deal list. And I know, Diane, you like the deal path page. There's we've we've looked at that before. So have a tool where I can literally take a screenshot of

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:27.626Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:29.784Z)

that page, upload it into the tool, and it will replicate it almost identically. Now we don't want it we don't wanna you know, pixel for pixel copy. But once I've got that built,

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:41.586Z)

Cut with

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:42.504Z)

I can go through and and make minor changes

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:32:43.926Z)

I don't wanna completely copy it. Right?

### You (2025-07-15T21:32:45.524Z)

And and then at the same time, while I'm putting that together, Vinod could be working somewhat on the the document processing, setting up the database and authentication and everything. And and that way, when he gets that complete, he'll have pretty much everything that he needs then to convert from the POC into the MVP. So that's the question where we've gone full circle. Well, you know, we're now we're back to the node and and band with and getting help and how to do it and how much. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:33:17.836Z)

Right. Do think that is the next important that's the next big question we have to answer maybe before Thursday when we talk again. Is with call it, some amount of money, and you guys will have to tell us what it is. Right? What can we reasonably accomplish between now and Labor Day? And then at Labor Day I mean, I guess, I'm not I'm I'm being too dramatic. At Labor Day, you guys can still you'd still keep working. Right? There's no way not to keep continuously improving the project. But Labor Day, then we need to start putting more emphasis on those letters from potential clients that say they would use our product and trying to figure out how we get a a 100 k to keep us going for six months. Cool. Sorry. I was driving home. I haven't raised, but I parked my car. So, I mean, let's let's close the features and then, you know, we can go from there. Yeah. I think what Dan just said was a good you know, it's like what are what that whatever what in in the whichever email it was where it was like, replicate within the POC, document processing and then the financial statement processing. And and maybe some some AI generated, you know, market research I guess I mean, would you would would would the intention be that you put this

### You (2025-07-15T21:35:08.343Z)

I'm I like I mentioned in the email or the video, I I'm gonna do the summary page. Which is basically the the cash flow summary of the deal. And get down to some of those IRR, cash on cash, you know, some of those metrics that we've been talking about I will add that. And then, like I said, I I can very quickly plagiarize the deal page. Right? And then go in there and tweak names and colors and you know basically I can just tell it to replace the pictures of of of what they've got on there with hotels. Right? Stock stock images of hotels. That won't take long. And and then that way, know, we'll have a full POC. That they can go out there and I I could take it to the next step and have a button in the sidebar that says generate report. It won't actually generate a report, but I can have a the PDF of what I've already done. As an example. Right? So like I said before, I'm not gonna go and lie to somebody and say, oh, look, they just generated this report. You know? But for POC, that's what we need. And then you know, to know it has on that plus the database and authentication and everything else, to get to the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:36:35.623Z)

Yeah. I mean, if we are just replicating we have in POC plus what we don't

### You (2025-07-15T21:36:41.053Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:36:41.693Z)

have few things like login, database, and all. First thing I need is to develop infrastructure. And for that, I need some car to put it on the cloud So That's what you the company credit card. Right? Which we might not have a company. We might have Mark Gordon's credit card.

### You (2025-07-15T21:37:00.533Z)

Oh, well, be sure to pass it around. Alright?

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:37:00.743Z)

Or sorry, Drew. It might be Drew Wallace's credit card. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So I'll get this started with infrastructure first. And if I can get some help, then, you know, I would just pass on the POC to them and, you know, get them started from there. Laptop. To kind of start helping level application so that, you know, we don't have to do it again. We just do it on one time and then we keep on adding new features in of spending time on the same thing again and again. So so it it is sort of incremental. Like, we would need $510,000 now to do what you're talking about which I mean, call it POC, MVP, whatever. It doesn't matter. But, like, to continue to develop what we've dealt with Howard you know, what you guys have already done, but kinda take it I guess, into the first step of being a production ready application. As well as something that's a more refined presentable product that we could take to probably not angel investors, but to either friends and family or to I mean, I I I like the idea of a of, you know, getting two or three or four groups to be sponsors, right, and each contributing

### You (2025-07-15T21:38:21.773Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:38:23.163Z)

$25 or right. And trying to get, you know, to a 100, which you get hopefully gets us, you know, three, six month runway to develop, a full production ready I guess, like, one or or MVP that we can then start putting customers on Yep. And and continuing to and and hopefully getting some payment for as well. So okay. That that makes sense. We have to get saying we have to get more work to buy into all this, but and I'm I'm sure his question is gonna be like, okay. Well, it's you know, put together the cost and the timeline and a and a a budget, so to speak. Which I I think we've just talked about it. But and we have various things on paper, but it's it needs to be more clearly probably marked out you know, first, next, what is it now? July, August, September. So, you know, two months, 10,000 for the next two months, 100,000 for the net you know, you know, for

### You (2025-07-15T21:39:23.473Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:39:24.503Z)

six months after that, Right? Like, are are the amounts of money that we have in the timelines we have realistic? Do they do they actually make sense? Yeah. I agree. Know I do think that we need a two year budget just to be able Yeah. No. I think the time comes, we're gonna have to

### You (2025-07-15T21:39:35.713Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:39:41.033Z)

surface that. Right? And Yeah. I think we well, what you have, I think, is is I think the numbers are correct. It's more just a matter of being able to phase them out over time. Mhmm. And it's because they're not all gonna

### You (2025-07-15T21:39:49.993Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:39:52.313Z)

you know, it's not we we're not gonna get that all at once. I mean, again, like, I think everything you research is is true. Like, there are it is sometimes the case where somebody comes up with a great idea, goes and gets $2,000,000 in exchange for a $5,000,000 valuation. But again, that's, like, probably was was more common or three years ago when everybody was looking to, like, throw money at technology companies, and it's not as real it's not as much the case now where things have slowed down and,

### You (2025-07-15T21:40:23.013Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:40:24.933Z)

people are there's not as much money out there. But Well, part one thing maybe I didn't mention is that 2,000,000 usually gets broken down into chunks. Right? And so but the chunks are still bigger than a 100 k. Right? You you might be looking for a 75 k chunk, and then you might be looking for a million dollar chunk. And but that's but you are trying to think about the complete two year window of what you need. Because kinda like Drew, what you said, like, when you took that budget to your data partner or your technology partner, right, and you didn't certain costs, and then you went back to them and they said, well, wait. This was never included in the budget. Yeah. I didn't include any salaries myself and then or I it was, like, you know, a very small amount. And then I realized, I was out of money. My hand we was out of money. I like, well, I now I need to, like, triple my salary tomorrow.

### You (2025-07-15T21:41:16.613Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:41:16.763Z)

Were like, the fuck? Right. And so that's what I'm just trying to protect against that we've really thought about, like, what I mean, we do need a a generous Yeah. Yeah. Technology budget. Right? Because we're going to have to figure out the AI piece of this.

### You (2025-07-15T21:41:30.583Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:41:33.153Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think alright. Well, it's all I mean, Howard, Vinod, or do you guys have Yeah. Yeah. I'm just wondering. So I think we know what got to develop. Right? Is, like, a good time to get it started? And I believe we kind of agreement on adding one more one or two more resources with cost probably close to 500 to 800 per month. Yeah. I think if I'm just to reiterate what I what I'm hearing or what I it sounds like this is you know, we're gonna need some small amount of money for the next eight weeks. Right? And maybe I think Mark and I have talked about that coming from each of us. As long as it's less than, you know, $10,000 total, Right? Like, we can if that's enough for the next eight weeks, twelve weeks to get us us to get the infrastructure to some of this infrastructure built to pay this a recent like, a offshore resource set around some of this stuff. Then that'll get us to, you know, eight to twelve weeks. And during that time, we will set up meetings to then with, again, you know, Driftwood, Peachtree, could be Actible, some of these other companies to try to find the net that next chunk of of money, that $100,000 amount, whatever, you know, that that will take us to for the next three to six months That Yeah. Yep. I think, yeah, we should be good with close to 10,000 budget for the next at least, two months. And then we should be winding up the MVP part with not lot of AI functionality. Yeah. Okay. Know Mark has definitely wants has a strong opinion just needs to have AI in it. You know? Like, it needs to be very demonstratable AI features you know, especially because it's in the name. But I know those are also more expensive. So And which which we can. Right? So as soon as our MVP is closed, our key features are done, then we can probably focus more on AI.

### You (2025-07-15T21:43:52.613Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:43:55.803Z)

We might have more budget by the time.

### You (2025-07-15T21:43:56.313Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:43:58.533Z)

Yeah. I even think that being able to standardize the the PNLs, right, submit them and have them load it, like even though that's not technically maybe maybe it's not, like, AI. Maybe it's more structured ETL processes. But I Howard, I I don't which tool it was instead. I think it Howard who said, like, at the end of the day, people are looking it's not they're not looking for AI. They're looking for does

### You (2025-07-15T21:44:20.673Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:44:21.723Z)

make my life easier? With technology? And, you know, if we could say, yes. It does.

### You (2025-07-15T21:44:24.543Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:44:28.843Z)

You know, I think lots of say and want to persuade Mark of this all this, but I think it it aligns what we talked about this morning. And gets us hopefully somewhere where we can start to get some actual momentum. Alright. Okay. So Okay. What's the next item to get it started? I think need is to have the credit card in place. So that we can get it started with the infrastructure I think we need I think we need a clearer I think there needs to be some clearer agreed upon like, before that happens, we need to have a some clear budget dot like, on on Thursday, we have another meeting on Thursday. Right? We should have some very clear month by month document that lays out It doesn't have to be super detailed, but it should lay out you know, every month for the next six six months. Two at least two months. But Two. Right? Yeah. Yeah. It's a labor day. It's labor day. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if we can go beyond that, great. But, like, at least, you know, what are what are we need and what are we paying for and and what's what's getting done.

### You (2025-07-15T21:45:44.763Z)

Yeah. I I I definitely agree. We have to go beyond that. The reason being when we start getting in front of clients, people in the industry, they're gonna be coming up with a lot of suggestions Right? Some of them, we just nod our head and say yes. We are going to add that to the list, but some of them may come up with something we missed. Or something that just isn't working right. So it's not like when we get an MVP, we can sit back and wait. Until that And we we gotta keep going. You know? Just always working on the next feature.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:46:27.793Z)

Yeah. And I think just to go back, like, your if I can get this opens. Right? Like, your budget The one I sent this afternoon because I'd cleaned up some of the mistakes. Okay. Yeah. I this might not be that. That one might be the early one. But this is I think we just need to break this out by month, basically. And and I I mean, like, there's not gonna be you know all of this should pretty much be zero for now. I mean, I don't think we really I we can use all of mean, Hotel VA is happy to share stuff, like, all of its service agreements and whatnot. So really shouldn't need much here. I mean, again, we couple $100 for a bank account, QuickBooks. Mhmm. So it's really, you know, it's it's the node your junior engineer you're talking about and then these technology costs And so it's these product tools and cloud hosting and

### You (2025-07-15T21:47:30.783Z)

Yeah. And and and remember, most of those product tools that I put together are subscription or monthly based. So yes. So we don't need the full 6,400 on day one.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:47:43.013Z)

They're monthly days, so it's not like we need this much

### You (2025-07-15T21:47:47.303Z)

We'll we'll need much less than that.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:47:51.003Z)

think yeah, if we can stretch this out, put just put it yeah. My You know? Month you know, August, September, October, November, December, you know, six to twelve months. Right? If we can detail off these monthly costs, I think that will be

### You (2025-07-15T21:48:01.153Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:48:03.863Z)

what we can talk about and get hopefully, get more comfortable with on Thursday.

### You (2025-07-15T21:48:08.303Z)

Alright. So, Diane, I'll I'll go through the the product. Portion. Now I think the nodes, most of that is probably gonna be upfront. Went to be did the node do they typically charge a monthly fee, or do you pay annually? Or how do you how do you do that for the for the database and everything else?

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:48:26.993Z)

It's monthly.

### You (2025-07-15T21:48:27.833Z)

Okay. Alright. So we can take a look at both of those and spread it out. Monthly. Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:48:36.383Z)

Yeah. The more we can spread out monthly, the better.

### You (2025-07-15T21:48:38.513Z)

Yeah. Yep. I'll go ahead and do that.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:48:43.893Z)

Okay. And then once you guys do that, I'll revise this budget. I I just wanna keep a placeholder in it, for the two year just so that it's like it it feels like it's complete and thoughtful.

### You (2025-07-15T21:48:52.683Z)

Yeah. Abs absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:48:56.643Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Got it. And I'm also now that I've got this budget done, I'm gonna start to turn my attention to the pitch deck. And try I don't know if I'll get it done by the end of this week, but I think in seven days, I should be able to I did a lot of work on it about a week ago. I'm just not great in PowerPoint, and I'm not great in things like Beautiful AI. I if I just spend the time, I'll I'll figure it out. But, you what I might need to come to you for just a little bit of, like, design opinion around colors and stuff like that? So yeah. Yeah. Any anytime. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm yeah. I'm be glad to help. On any marketing or sales side. I think probably sales side, Howard, would be your best Howard, Drew, or Mark. From marketing perspective, if you need any PPT website, anything yeah, I'm there. Okay. Okay. Alright.

### You (2025-07-15T21:49:52.253Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:49:54.823Z)

Alright, everyone. We will talk on Thursday. And, yes, I know I was a bit of a Debbie Downer on this call. Try I'm just trying to be practical, but I just wanna close with, like, this is the the I mean, anything I've ever worked on my career, I believe in this more than anything because it's so needed coming together. It exists. We're building it. I mean, it's capital markets related. Decision makers would be

### You (2025-07-15T21:50:25.053Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:50:25.173Z)

the ones using this or their analysts. And I really, really believe this is a big opportunity. But, like, Howard, as you sent out earlier, there's gonna be a point that comes over three to six months where we're really gonna have to pay a attention to things like liquidation rights and things that could

### You (2025-07-15T21:50:42.603Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:50:43.893Z)

blow you know, just, like, make this a horrid story for us. Ten years from now if we aren't researched and knowledgeable about deal structuring on on some of those things.

### You (2025-07-15T21:50:50.763Z)

Yep. Yep. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're welcome.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:50:54.803Z)

Yep. So thank you for sending that article out. Yeah. Alright. Alright, friends.

### You (2025-07-15T21:51:00.943Z)

Yep. Alright. Diane,

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:51:03.223Z)

See you Thursday. Cool. Thanks, everyone.

### You (2025-07-15T21:51:03.873Z)

we're right there with you, so don't worry about it. We'll get there.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:51:06.133Z)

Bye.

### You (2025-07-15T21:51:07.523Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:51:08.583Z)

Right? We believe. We have I mean, I believe. So it's just getting from

### You (2025-07-15T21:51:12.513Z)

Yep. Alright. Thanks, Chris.

### Guest (2025-07-15T21:51:13.553Z)

here to there. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Bye, guys. Bye.
