### Guest (2025-07-21T19:01:49.515Z)

Mhmm. K. Confirm. Okay. There we go. It should be good. Okay. And, Howard, is Vinod joining, or is it just you and I today?

### You (2025-07-21T19:02:04.843Z)

That's just the two of us today.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:02:06.025Z)

It's two of us today. Okay.

### You (2025-07-21T19:02:07.663Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:02:10.335Z)

Well, Mimi, thanks for taking the time to catch up with us. As I mentioned, Howard and Vinod are cofounders. With me in InnVestAI, and we're finally I'm finally pushing it forward. I Howard and Vinod were technology leaders for Red IQ. A multifamily AVM that was owned by Berecadia and then ultimately sold to Radix. And it was Berecadia that Jared Kelso introduced me to Howard about the same time that Paul introduced me to Carlos. And we've been networking over the past year, year and a half about technology technology platforms. And in January, Howard and I decided to partner together to bring our hotel AVM to life. Shortly thereafter, Vinod came on board as well, and Vinod was with Red Eye He is our chief technology officer, and Howard is our chief product officer. Mhmm. And we've been working for about five, six months on this. We're at the proof of concept stage. We have two additional cofounders, and it's a really great cofounding team. So, again, two people from the multifamily space who have successfully monetized an AVM. And then on the hotel side, it's myself and then a young man named Drew Wallace. He has a company called Hotel Biz that serves the asset manage the hotel asset management community. Sun Stone and Starwood Capital are clients of his. Flynn out in San Francisco, and Woodbine. So he is essentially has 50 management hotel companies mapped against each other because he's servicing the hotel investors. And he's a cofounder that helps us with the hotel data. Then our the last cofounder is a gentleman named Mark Gordon. And Mark is a former hotel broker. He was with Sonnenblick Goldman for a very, very long time before he sold it Cushman Wakefield. And to pull the connection all the way through, some of the Berecadia senior hotel team worked for him at Sonne and Blick. And so it's a small industry. That's how we all know each other. Howard the node, Drew, Mark, and I have been working, and we're at the proof of and I'm gonna let Howard chime in and and do the introduction. I'm just kinda setting it all up. We're the proof of concept stage for the hotel AVM. It's the vision that I had I had said and talked to you, and Carlos junior about. It is a deal path almost like specifically built for hospitality investing. With a built in hotel AVM. And then long term, we intend to have, like, an asset management platform that'll be, a pair of you. It'll be more on the investment side. Because there are a lot of operational hotel asset management groups out there right now. And moving into MVP. We will probably get to the MVP shortly after Labor Day. But I wanted to reconvene with you guys because of Domino and the good conversations that we've had over the past year and a half. I feel like Driftwood is a group that is really a leader in the space, hotel investment space when it comes to technology and how you view it. You were, an early investor in Revere, and our strategy isn't Revere's, but it has a lot of parallels to Revere and kind of where we stand and what we're gonna do. So, that's why we're connecting. And then I'll I'll turn it. So Howard, Manny is the chief technology officer for Driftwood. And, Manny, you joined was it about a year and a half ago? Or long ago? Years now. Two years. Yeah. Coming up on two years. Yeah. Yes. And so he was formerly in crypto, and developed a few MVPs right, or at least one MVP in the crypto space that you've told me about. Yep. And Driftwood brought him on board to run technology for them, and he's well, one of the things he's doing, he does a lot more, but he's spearheading a a platform called dominant Domino. Right? How Domino, which is an internal data analytics platform, but very focused on investments and investment metrics and things like that. So well, I'm sorry. I just I did a whole bunch of rambling, but I should turn it over to Howard to just truly introduce himself to you. Then we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in the POC.

### You (2025-07-21T19:06:57.283Z)

Yeah. Alright. Well, Manny, good to meet you. Appreciate you taking the time to speak with us today. As Diane yeah. As as Diane mentioned,

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:07:03.385Z)

Yeah. Great to meet you as well.

### You (2025-07-21T19:07:07.293Z)

my my background is in multifamily thirty plus years, literally started off as an apartment community manager, worked up to various positions. But my background is finance and economics, so I really kind of gravitated toward the asset management field. Of of multifamily, and I was vice president of asset management for BH Management Services. Also, worked as director of business intelligence for Bell Partners and few other larger of multifamily owners and investors. So as an asset manager, you know, one of the areas that I was responsible for, of course, was acquisitions, dispositions, well as the ongoing asset management of the of the of the deals. But I also found myself really kinda being pulled towards the technology side. I was always one of the one of the early adopters of a lot of the technology out there. And I was drawn toward the technology side at the back end thousand and five, I was asked to join RealPage. I was living in Dallas at the time. I was asked to join RealPage to help with their central reporting product. Which was their first foray into a consolidated and aggregated database of all their different products, which were very siloed. And then combining that into our database and that's where I kinda got the bug to go full time into the tech side. So I did work with them for a while and then starting in 2011, I worked with a company called AUM. Which was a multifamily utility billing management company that was subsequently purchased by RealPage. I also worked for another company that was bought by RealPage. I ended up back at RealPage. Not not voluntarily, but I've been there for for quite a while. But but since 2011 now for about the about last fourteen years. I have been on the product management side lending my subject matter expertise to

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:09:32.825Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:09:33.963Z)

vendors and prop tech providers primarily multifamily. But as Diane mentioned, when I was at Red IQ, you know, that is a multifamily underwriting and valuation tool. And they were acquired by Berecadia to help with their brokerage. And, you know, Berecadia at the time was strictly multifamily investments. They've since added additional asset types into their portfolio, one of which being the hotel, which is how I met Diane. And then Red IQ was acquired by Radixx last August, but it was a it was a good opportunity but bad timing. And

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:10:19.945Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:10:21.403Z)

so long long story short, back in January, as Diane already mentioned, we decided to go ahead and partner up and take what we had at Red IQ, which was a very successful product, and apply it towards the hospitality. So that's that's where we are today.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:10:45.625Z)

And so That's great. Yep. And so we've been working on the proof of concept and we we're gonna give you a like, what you see inside under the hood today. It is still a proof of concept, and we're working to the MVP. So I know you know what that means. Like, we we definitely have spent a lot of time working through how it needs to look and be structured and the mechanics of it. But Vinod, our chief technology officer, is kind of taking it from Howard at this point. And, Howard, you can explain that part better than I can, but we're essentially now starting with the software development component of it.

### You (2025-07-21T19:11:23.153Z)

Yeah. Let me go ahead and share my screen and while I'm bringing this up, let me just just mention that what what Diana is referring to is is what I'm showing on the screen here which is a proof of concept, which is actually developed by some no code tools. And so I've been using some no code applications to basically vibe this into existence. But it is it is functional. And, trust me, I've broken it quite a few times, but we've been able to to to make it work here. Now we we've we're gonna have two different two different websites essentially. We you know, we'll have our in client facing website. Which will have the pipeline on there, which is basically a list of all your deals. What you have available, in your in your InnVestAI portfolio. But I added I added it here because it is really truly an integral part

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:12:27.385Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:12:31.603Z)

of the whole user journey. So I'm gonna go ahead and walk you through real quick. I know wanna get into the weeds. It is functional, but I'm not gonna go through the entire process. We'd be here for way too long. But so the pipeline like I said, would be on the user's screen I'm gonna have to minimize my teams call there. And, of course, this is very similar to what you would what you would see with any tool. In fact, I'm gonna slide it over here and you can see one bug that I've got to fix already where the where as I scroll over the the headers going over the sidebar, But here, you know, I can add a new property and you can see a second or third one pops in there, I can input the name, etcetera. But ideally, what we're also gonna do is what when we click on that add property, it'll bring us over here to the property details. And this is where we start

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:13:31.845Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:13:32.213Z)

going through the entire user journey. Of going through and setting up a deal. Now I do have some required fields here and just for time purposes, I'm just gonna input gibberish into these just so I can keep moving on. As quickly as possible.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:13:49.835Z)

And and the deal path part of this, is what Howard was showing you, the pipeline, we've spent more time on the AVM than we have on the pipeline part of it, but you're a DealPath user. And so that's also, like, an another reason why you're first on my list because I know you and Carlos know deal path very well and have opinions about it. But what we're essentially that is that will be part of this platform is a hotel purpose built deal path, right, that then we're gonna get into the the ABM component

### You (2025-07-21T19:14:25.503Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:14:25.925Z)

up at next.

### You (2025-07-21T19:14:26.653Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:14:26.825Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:14:27.143Z)

Yeah. So just before I look over to the next screen, you know, we we will have the option, and this will be vital to the pipeline for groupings, filtering, sorting, you can select whether it's a full service convention, extended stay, etcetera, Options over here, these will be what is the status of the deal, is it in process, Is it already closed? You know, already purchased? Maybe we we won the deal, etcetera. So we'll we'll populate this drop down with with that type of information here. So and then you can also input the brand of the hotel if it's under management by a third party and then we'll also have versioning in this model.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:15:10.765Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:15:12.833Z)

And you can you can either use the standard version one, version two, or you could actually input a a different version name. You know, you might be working with different JV partners, and each one might have different investment thresholds and and requirements. So I have, you know, my investor one, investor two, models that we can work on concurrently When I click on the next tab, this is going to bring me over to the department and item selection. This is this is gonna help us really get down into the details

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:15:42.965Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:15:46.543Z)

You know, a lot of hotels, they don't have food and beverage or get a shop or anything like that. So you could select none or you could go through here drill down into specifics So perhaps maybe the deal I'm looking at has a sports bar in it, And what this is gonna do is, this is going to control the next section, which is the when you fill in the pro form a and you're getting down into line item details, you know, even still, some people may just prefer to put in an an overall food and beverage and others for whatever reason, maybe they're gonna add a sports bar to it. You know, that way you can only have the items visible you're going through the pro form a that you need. Rather than having to scroll down through all these different choices and so forth. So you know, if you get down into this other operated, you know, you can you can get down into a lot of different categories here, you know, I wouldn't want to have a row on my pro form a for every one of these items if it doesn't apply. So this

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:16:50.745Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:16:51.443Z)

this will be help from for the for the user journey itself. And then, finally, the last step of setting this up is the document upload. So, of course, when you're underwriting a deal, you need to have the historical data. To go by. So you know, typically, this will be provided by the the broker, or perhaps by the seller depending on who's working on it. But this also does apply to asset management. So I might be importing a deal here not to acquire or sell, but as an asset management function. So

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:17:28.545Z)

I see.

### You (2025-07-21T19:17:29.223Z)

every month, every quarter, every year, you know, I can upload my financial statements, drag and drop or, you know, I can choose files, go through, and and use the the typical file selector here. I would indicate over here what type of option it is, whether it's a financial statements, and users will be able to upload their own private STI reports in here so that will be part of the market data section.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:17:51.095Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:17:55.773Z)

And then when I click save, it'll upload that information and for financial statements, and STI reports, what we're gonna be doing is utilizing basic document data extraction. You know, there's gonna be an AI element to it.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:18:11.265Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:18:14.763Z)

And know, just parse the data, and put that data in the database to be used in the remaining sections.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:18:23.935Z)

And, Manny, one thing we're working on in the background is that because Drew has 50 management companies mapped against each other, and he's getting data. I'll call it digitally, but it's still not through an API with the management but we aspire to get there. So at some point in the next two years, our aspiration is that no one is dropping files and and rolling it up. It's just all the information is getting digitally between the, you know, the owner, the operator, and kind of into InnVestAI, and that we are moving away from Excel and email and things like that and just having a direct data transfer. And that will help us build the database for the hotel industry using the using investments. Right, as kind of the well, serving the hotel investment to make their lives much better, their underwriting much faster, more accurate, and just take the data manipulation out of it.

### You (2025-07-21T19:19:27.553Z)

Yep. Oh, no. No. No. That's fine. You you you have the

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:19:28.615Z)

Sorry, Howard. I didn't mean to jump in.

### You (2025-07-21T19:19:32.253Z)

experience in this, so any color you can add is appreciated. So then the next step in the process is bringing in your market data. And so as I mentioned, we can upload the the STR report here. So here's a sample that we can upload But what we would also like is the ability for the user to edit this information And so if the if there's anything in here or they wanna update this information, they can edit it. If they don't feel that they're the one of the deals that are on the report are not applicable, they can delete it, etcetera. And so, you know, they can they can not only take what the report was uploaded, but they can also modify it if necessary. But along those same lines, then we also have an operating statistics So I know when I was in in acquisitions and, you know, one of the things that Drew mentioned is, you know, you always have conversations with the seller. Or with the sellers competition, And so this is where a user could input their own market data. So here, we could have property one. Right? So this could be

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:20:42.795Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:20:45.873Z)

we'll just call it comp hotel one, etcetera. And then I could put in some information maybe for you know, 2023, I can spell right there. It could be the the fiscal year, you know, how many rooms are in there, etcetera. I can go through and and fill in all of this information. You know, if I put in my occupancy here, let's say it was eighty seven point five, it's gonna go ahead and calculate the RevPAR of that information calculate notes, and and I as the user can go ahead and input this as much as I want. And so, know, I might have two, three, four properties I can keep going.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:21:27.335Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:21:27.523Z)

Indefinitely. To to input some operating statistics And then there's a similar page here for transaction summary.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:21:34.745Z)

And

### You (2025-07-21T19:21:35.293Z)

So know, we can go through here and and the user can input whatever information they have just like on the other page. For any transactions that may have taken place in that market. Now this is low hanging fruit I've we've already experimented with with agentic AI to go out get public records, So not so much on the operating statistics because some of these things, the occupancy everything else might not be public. You might wanna get this from your from your source. But a lot of the transaction summary obviously, we can we can get

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:22:10.655Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:22:13.663Z)

know, what property was it? When did it sell? May or may not have renovation amount or area, this might be manually input, know, but we would know what the sales amount was. May or may not be able to get the buyer and the seller, but you know, this could be filled in a lender, etcetera. So this is this is one of the things we wanna quickly get to

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:22:31.565Z)

And then jumping back.

### You (2025-07-21T19:22:33.633Z)

automating as much as possible and reducing the amount of manual inputs by the user. I'm sorry, Diane. You're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:22:40.785Z)

And then jumping back for a moment no. No. No. To the operating

### You (2025-07-21T19:22:41.113Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:22:43.925Z)

stats, I just when I was at CBRE and I was going through this process with them, I had a long conversation with host and their head of business analytics. And he said, you know, they've built out an internal data system as well. But he was very interested in the underwriting component and the idea of underwriting. And he said one thing that would help host considerably is to be able to have, like, a storage container for all their underwriting comms. Because they're sitting in different underwriting models all across their server. So this is it's the same in the multifamily space, but that's what

### You (2025-07-21T19:23:18.603Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:23:20.305Z)

is intended to be. So, like, if I'm host and I'm using InvestAI, any you know, if I have a comp from the four seasons that I bought, in Vancouver. Right? And I have comps from that that I wanna use on another deal that somehow I just got from a friend or from a feasibility team. It's all captured and centralized in this data. In this in this container. We at InnVestAI, we will never touch this. This is you this is yours or this is the customer's We will never, you know, roll this up or, you know, autonomous this information. We will other information as long as we have a service agreement with you that allows us to do that. But this is one area that we think will really help transaction teams speed up their underwriting is to have decentralized comparables. So are you supposing, right, for example, Khan what do you say, renovation cost? Right? This should be part of the OM. Isn't that are you is this all pre OM? Or post So The seed of OM. Right. So the OM is a document that could be dropped in. And if it has renovation costs, then as Howard said, we can you know, pull that up through scraping into the software just like a deal path would do with an OM. But we are thinking down the line, right, and thinking about, alright, PIPs are gonna be a huge part of the deal process going forward. They always have been. But more so post COVID with the delay and so many renovations. So we're talking to some groups. Right now, I'm having a conversation with a company called MindClick. And they are a platform that's been working with the hotel brands for about fifteen years on green and sustainable elements in renovations. So they're tracking PIP information already. And I've been talking to them about a potential partnership so that we could get in with the brands and almost, like, help to automate this process beyond just grabbing the information from an OM. But really be managing this, like, almost like a living, breathing document. Right? We're getting it from the brands. It's rolling up. As the PIP is getting negotiated, things get changed here. And then when you close and move on to asset management, you're able to manage and and I can log in. And essentially, like, track the PIP through InvestAI. But that would probably mean that you are working in conjunction and it have, like, an API with Procore or something along those lines. But we're we're thinking about that right now, how we roll that out over a year or two period. Manny, did I lose you? I'm so sorry. No. No. All good. I just had to go off camera for a second. I was reaching for something here. But yeah. Makes sense that the OM extraction process like you guys have either built it or going to build it. Is that the thought process there?

### You (2025-07-21T19:26:27.033Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:26:28.425Z)

Extracting just data out of the OM.

### You (2025-07-21T19:26:29.353Z)

Yeah. A a lot a lot of things that we are

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:26:31.785Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:26:32.683Z)

rolling out are things that the node and I have already done previously.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:26:35.805Z)

K.

### You (2025-07-21T19:26:37.603Z)

You know, with with the o n you know, if you get it in a PDF, you can obviously use vision or just go ahead and extract the data from the PDF. Typically on an OM, they don't get into the item detail that we we may want, like I like my example with food and beverage, you know, maybe they will But there's a lot of things that we want. We we want this to be a one stop tool for a broker, for an investor, but we're also looking for lenders consultants.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:27:12.735Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:27:13.333Z)

Loan servicers, all of the people who would have a reason to to use this and we want to be able to utilize AI to go through and evaluate it and and

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:27:25.965Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:27:26.763Z)

potentially point out areas where, you know, I might be falling short of my required returns and, you know, it could point out potential areas to look at. But But also to go through and and write up a report for the investment committee and put together a nice clean package for the investment committee. So you know, you could take some of the text from the OM, upload it into the notes

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:27:51.585Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-07-21T19:27:53.173Z)

Right? So, yeah, we can we can we can pull all of that data off of

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:27:53.475Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-21T19:27:57.003Z)

all these different sources and and be able to have it housed within this deal. From for the user. And use it to to do that plus I'll touch on in a minute what Diane was alluding to the fact that we would have also some anonymized and aggregated data that we could pull in and and provide, you know, more specific market data.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:28:22.635Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:28:25.023Z)

Looking at trends, you know, we know, you know, what are the hot markets we can see, you know, who's underwriting where and, you know, is there a lot of activity and particular region, etcetera. So

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:28:34.685Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:28:36.103Z)

yeah. Which you you're obviously very familiar with. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:28:37.445Z)

No. That that's helpful. Right? No. No. That's most most definitely. I think that is that is something we are definitely are interested in. The other piece I would say is, Dan, you mentioned that you are either in the process of working with. Did I hear you correctly? Right? Like, third parties Yep. Who might provide either a benchmark or actual data around this property. Yes. We are. We have Drew is working. I can't I can't I can't you the details right now because it was very confidential, but he's working on a really wonderful potential strategic relationship with us on the data side. And then we would, of course, bring Hot Stats or Calibri I mean, I'm a big fan of Cindy Estes Green and her Hummingbird tool, which is a which can be used for underwriting. But our goal is almost like a cherry and well, I mean, we're not cherry. Right? But to be able to go and get all of that data and pull it in and save the underwriter of the date the time it takes them to manipulate all of that data. So partnerships are important to us. API integrations are important to us. And we plan on kind of just going all the way down. So we're, you know, we're starting with again, you know, groups that provide data. Maybe even, like, property management systems. We're working on some strategic relationships there. We want to work on this mind click relationship which could get us to the brands and then potentially a Procore so that you're starting to really get into the CapEx. We're starting to dig into the legal aspect of it. With Harvey or Ironclad and we want to form, like, a user group with some hotel attorneys to understand how they're digitizing their workflows, Mhmm. You know, so we're we're just trying to go and think through the whole process, and this becomes command central. Basically, if it takes you a day and a half to underwrite a deal, can you get that down to twenty minutes or an hour? Right? And and that's our goal is to make this a a wonderful, useful tool for investors and deal makers. And the question is, how do you see this flowing? So this is this is your evaluation model. Where where would an acquisition model sit in this context?

### You (2025-07-21T19:31:11.153Z)

That's actually where we're we're that's actually where we're heading

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:31:12.335Z)

In this workflow? Well, mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:31:16.123Z)

now. If you if you want me to to keep going through these next couple pages because many I I think this this is what's

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:31:22.275Z)

Sure. Please.

### You (2025-07-21T19:31:23.703Z)

this is probably what's gonna excite you the most. So so far, you know, we put in historical data historical financial statements. You know, we've got the market data. What did they do last year in terms of renovations? You know, that that's all pretty cut and dry and it's not

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:31:40.665Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:31:41.853Z)

really uncommon. They were difficult to get from multiple sources. What we're looking at now when we are putting together the acquisition model, which would be the valuation and the pro form a sections here, we're looking forward, right, So when I am inputting this data, my discount rate, what is what is my acquisition cap rate All of this information, this is forward looking. So we are going to be in a position to do some predictive analytics. And predict where markets are heading. And then certainly, you can use a data and and trend it out and look at others. Other data to provide the estimates you know, if we see in a particular market the cap rates being underwritten at 5.5 or 4.9 and they're currently in the sixth level. Right? We we know that that's obviously gonna be a market or vice versa, but we have that information in advance. So this is where we're starting to get into where we're talking about having the anonymized and aggregated data. Where we can input that information and and together some of these predictive analytics tools would be helpful to the industry. So this is where you would put in your acquisition assumptions and it's gonna calculate the metrics down here. On the financing tab, you know, I can put in all of my

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:33:13.385Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:33:15.633Z)

expected requirements there. If I want, like, for closing costs, I can just put in a percentage here, or if I want to really line item them out, I can click on the detail and then this section becomes available where I can input all of these individual line item expenses. Right? So go through and input all of that information. Down here then, I would have all of my assumptions for the financing and then on the exit you know, this is what I expect my exit cap rate to be, ballpark sales expense, so then I can put together the the investment summary down here, which we'll get to. Once I have this, then this is where I get into the line item projections. So at all times, you will see on the valuation page, there's gonna be some specific metric cards up here. So right now, for the proof of concept, this this is just hard input data. There's no calculations that are live on here, but one of the things we also wanted to make sure is that no matter where you are in the model, unlike Excel, you might have to flip back to a different page or or do some, you know, different things that is just a waste of time. Always gonna have the key metrics that are important to the deal visible no matter where you are. And then so same thing up here. As I'm going through and inputting my assumptions down here for my forecast years here, let me make the page a little bit bigger. I'll be able to track every time I input a a digit on here, what the effect is gonna be on on the key metrics So here, you know, we're gonna be tracking gross operating profit. Gross operating profit PAR, the GOP percentage revenue, EBITDA, it's And then on the occupancy, you know, we'll have our limbs and fees available occupied rooms, occupancy percentage. And then as I go through both my revenue and expense items, I can track the effect up here. And if I want to expand my other operated revenue and see the food and beverage, etcetera, by the group, I can see that. Same thing on the expense. Where I can take a look at those same other operated, but I also have my distributed expenses down here. So, you know, you can track all of these. As you're going through and importing your occupancy. And your revenue expenses. And on most lines, we've tried to be as inclusive as possible all the different ways that somebody might want to forecast that information. So even right here, subject property occupancy. You know, I could go through here and just input what my expects expectations are gonna be, and as I do so, it's gonna make my adjustments. Others just prefer to input year over year growth. Right? So now I can go down here and say, you know, I expect a 1% growth or a 2.5% growth. Year over year. So which whichever bent whichever method you prefer. You can go ahead and do that. It's gonna calculate your ADR and same thing here. I can just input a flat

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:36:29.195Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:36:31.663Z)

growth, and if I change this, say, to 3%, you'll notice over here in my forecast years, it's just 3% per year. Or I can do just like I did above, put in the yearly growth and then I can come down to here and, you know, I expect maybe a 2% next year 3% the following year, and you can see it's gonna go through in in change the calculations. Then down here, I'm gonna go real quickly here. You can input your revenue occupied room. Your other revenue accents, and and what I really like to point out down here is on other expenses. There are three different ways we could do it here. So we could just do it on a preoccupied room in the I select that, it's gonna calculate my historical

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:37:18.405Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-21T19:37:18.633Z)

on a per occupied room. And I can just continue forward. I could do percent of revenue in which case that it's gonna calculate the percent of revenue at for its respective revenue line item as well. So food and beverage expense as a percentage of food and beverage revenue, or again, I might just wanna manually input I can take a look at my trends and, you know, I can go through here and input whatever number I want throughout my projection period, my forecast period. So in this particular model, we put in a whole period of five years, but could be two, be ten, you know, whatever you input here is how many years we're gonna have visible in the forecast. So you can see we can go all the way down here Actually, let me get this back up there. Going all the way down, we've got our gross operating profit. Then we've got our non operating expenses with our management fees, etcetera. We can get down all the way to total expense, EBITDA, and I can put in my reserve for replacement here. I have to calculate the numbers going across And then we also have our capital expenditures. So we can actually get below the NOI here and we can put in, you know, new roof if I can spell it correctly. And I can select here what category is that. So obviously that's gonna be building exterior, and it might be, you know, three hundred and fifty thousand in year '2. Right? Or 35,000. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:38:53.155Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:38:53.573Z)

So I can keep going. We start off with two rows, but I may have a very extensive CapEx plan and I can just keep adding as as needed. So that is

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:39:05.195Z)

And we may be scanning these in from, like, PCAs. Like, are again, going back

### You (2025-07-21T19:39:05.503Z)

yep.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:39:10.165Z)

to how do we make this the the least manual for the user Right? And connecting data. And then we're very focused on getting to the NOI line because this is an underwriting AVM platform versus just comparables. So we get to the NOI line, and we have the historicals and the projected NOI we're also starting to have some strategic conversations with title companies because if you can essentially, the the the closing process is digitizing as well right now. Right? So if we can work with the title company then you have NOI and you have the actual you know, purchase price from the closing statement, you have cap rate information. And then that goes back in to our data lake, right, and and really helps to have those the investment metrics and things like that for the hotel industry. We believe having accurate cap rate information where it really is NOI and correct purchase price and the CapEx and the PIP included. Would be the most incredibly useful information for the hotel and investment industry, especially aggregated and anonymized where you can start to really develop and understand what's going on in the space. So anonymized because you're thinking like a cherry or the world. Right? So you have other people's data, so you're gonna anonymize, provide

### You (2025-07-21T19:40:34.243Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:40:37.465Z)

automated benchmarking, essentially. Right? Because I've seen this kind of deal. In this market over the last six months, twelve months, whatever. Is that how you're thinking as well? Yes. Once we get enough data, we'll have in app in app benchmarking. Right? And Yeah. Something else that you know, in chatting with some management companies about this, they have said, oh, well, you know what? I would rather just have all of my hotel management, like, the management company itself, the feasibility group, to essentially connect all of their data so that when the feasibility analyst is underwriting, they can quickly get to their comp. If that makes sense. So we feel like this is a way to really data in the hotel industry. Yep. By going after the capital markets component of it. And, what do participants on the platform get back for sharing their data? However, you should you should take this because you did it at Red IQ.

### You (2025-07-21T19:41:42.583Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Basically, it's it would be accessed to those reports. And being able to create your comparables no matter which market you're in.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:41:54.325Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:41:56.763Z)

So it's basically, you know, pay to play if if you want to

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:42:00.675Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:42:01.313Z)

enjoy the benefits of those services, which would be part of your part of your costs that would be part of the product. You just share your data. And I I know that they're, back at Red IQ, we we had clients that it was just against their company policy. They

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:42:16.575Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:42:18.473Z)

could not and would not share their data.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:42:20.965Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:42:21.763Z)

But overall, we had more than 78% participation, which is pretty good. You know, we were talking, you know, you know, hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of deals that were in our database over a large number of span of what, ten years. So yeah, I I think a lot of people actually are willing to share their data. And again, you it's not gonna be the property name. It's not you know, we'll know, you know, maybe the ZIP

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:42:47.085Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:42:47.623Z)

code or or something like that, but you're not gonna be able to compare assets to asset. Right? Nobody wants to get down to that level or or share that their their data at that level.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:42:58.835Z)

Fair enough.

### You (2025-07-21T19:42:59.533Z)

But, yeah, it's it hasn't been it hasn't been an issue that I've come across.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:43:02.495Z)

K. Very cool. And what about, you know, typically under like this, love to live in Excel. And this at least in its current know? Incarnation looks like a web based

### You (2025-07-21T19:43:17.993Z)

It is.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:43:21.575Z)

tool.

### You (2025-07-21T19:43:21.583Z)

Yeah. It is. One of the things, you know, I consider myself to be an expert in Excel. I used it for many years. You know, I could write the VBA. I I could get in there and make

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:43:34.295Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:43:34.523Z)

Excel sing and dance. I love Excel. But I also know how dangerous Excel can be. Right? Lot of people refer back to that University of Hawaii report that they did where up to 80% of all models contain an error.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:43:49.855Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:43:50.553Z)

Of some sort. So it could be a spelling error, could be a you know? But I I guess what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to rehabilitate the industry and try to steer them away from

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:44:01.355Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:44:01.703Z)

Excel and hopefully do that with a product that you you know nobody's gonna change a formula. Nobody's gonna hard input a a number where a formula used to be be able to use conditional formatting like you could in Excel to to flag, know, inputs or or

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:44:18.245Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:44:20.833Z)

numbers that are out of line. But we would be comparing them to the market Not that that somebody may have fat fingered it, but if if somebody put comes in and puts in, you know, I'm gonna get 90% occupancy, but the market seventy eight. Right? You wanna be able to to to flag that which is something you can't do in Excel. We will be including an export to Excel functionality. Right? If you wanna take the data that you put in here,

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:44:44.975Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:44:47.803Z)

and export it but my goal is to not give people a reason to use Excel. You know, we will in that pipeline

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:44:57.005Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-21T19:44:57.613Z)

be able to check properties, And if I wanna do a roll out of deals, I can do it. I I just choose which properties I want. You know, I can compare by the property type, the year built, you know, whatever whatever metric you wanna, you know, compare, we can we can do it right here online. And in real time.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:45:18.665Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:45:20.693Z)

You know, that's a problem we had at Red IQ. It was built on a very old system and if you changed an input sometimes you'd have to wait a minute or two or

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:45:31.735Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:45:31.913Z)

it just crashed the program. Right? This one, I've been testing every time on here that every time I input even a digit I don't know if you noticed when I was inputting like the percentages. When I put in the one, it calculated everything. When I put it in a 1.5, you know, it was it was instant.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:45:48.415Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:45:51.993Z)

And that's really an advantage that we have as as well using a web app such as this. So

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:45:59.025Z)

One thing we've heard from clients is something that's important to them is to be able to actually track the changes that are done

### You (2025-07-21T19:46:07.973Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:46:08.455Z)

And so we have the ability to track the changes that are done as long as it's done in the web based application. Once it goes to Excel I mean, we we understand there's gonna be a a a point where we're just gonna be dealing with Excel initially because people won't be able to let go of it. Right? And and it's gonna take time. But we can't track it once it gets out of our application. Right? So that's a valuable service that we can't provide if it's exported to Excel. We're also intending to start very basic. I mean, this is probably we're thinking it may be a better application in debt and initially to get the reps underneath us. Right? And then build out with what Howard was showing you earlier, is the ability to drill down into food and beverage, into golf, into spa, right, with all the data backed up and for us to work with the industry to create really great don't know if you call them a template or right? But so it's the the way we would analyze the data in Excel. We would like at a very granular level for complex assets. By, like, year one or two, we wanna be able to do that in platform, but that isn't gonna happen immediately. Right? It's gonna take us time and working with our operator and our owners you know, in tandem to say, how do you like to analyze this? You know, for revenue, I'm a big segmentation person. I really like to drill deep down into segmentation and be able to quarter lie, you know, make it quarterly, and so I can see seasonality and pull in travel click and pull in Nolan. And so that's what we're thinking about. But initially, just jumping off the cliff, it's it's a basic AVM, that we would be doing in Excel with a lot of opportunity going forward to make it bespoke for complex hotel transactions. Got it. So, I know we coming up quickly on time. Just curious, like, you mentioned the number of the clients or conversations that are going on. Do you have anyone signed up who's using this live? Right now? This is the proof of concept. So we've had communication with lenders that are interested in helping us get to an MVP, but it's gonna take it the way we see it. It's it's almost August. Right? And so we are working on for Labor Day to have something that is more than this that we could actually go out and onboard clients to test out the the tool. We'd like to keep the we'd like to keep that to a few clients initially just so that we're really working with them again to get the reps done right. And over the September to March period, that six month period, while we are working strategically with a handful of clients They may pay. They may not pay. I know we're just really, we want the the rep we wanna make sure we get the product right. We'll also be seeking pre seed capital so that that'll take four to six months. And so it kind of all lines up that, call it, March year. We have a very functioning product and we've raised pre seed capital, and then we're ready to take it to the next level. So that's where our heads are on it. And, again, we don't wanna go out too large initially. We don't wanna, you know, have six clients using this in October. We wanna keep it to two or three. While we work through and get the product exactly right for, you know, whatever whatever segment we go after first, knowing that this will be an evolving thing over the really over the next ten years probably. Fair enough. Fair enough. Where do I see waterfall Would is that built out? Or

### You (2025-07-21T19:50:02.883Z)

No. Actually, yeah, that that's all we have left here. You know, I've got the investment summary here that goes through the the life cycle with the with the acquisition, the sales assumptions, etcetera.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:50:14.715Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:50:16.553Z)

Of course, we will have, you know, some some reports are included with the tool. And then also, we do plan on having this to be a central repository, not just for the underwriting, but for any documentation you might wanna upload that are related to both the acquisition disposition or ongoing operations. But down here, this is my parking lot, this is kind of a note to myself, right? This is

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:50:40.785Z)

I see. Okay.

### You (2025-07-21T19:50:42.663Z)

This is the one feature that I still haven't put together a proof of concept on. But, yeah, this is this is where we're gonna start getting into partnership agreements and how your initial funding is set up what what investment hurdles you're gonna have, and so very similar to the to the pages I've already shown you where they can input the the investment criteria. We can also have those cards displayed at the top. So if we're not meeting particular hurdles, you know, we can we can use formatting there and and be able to point out Operational. Efficiencies as well as the acquisition and disposition.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:51:23.545Z)

And one at some point in the future, we'd love to get to the point where pro form a actually ties to actuals, and we can start to bridge that. Right? Because that's something that you do cons constantly during the first few years of an acquisition is go back and compare to pro form a. I've done that manually so many times. And it just is a painful process. So that that's the pain point we're solving. Is the inefficiency in the process. That's what we're going after dead on from a capital markets perspective. Whereas most others in the space that we know are going at it asset management perspective. So what we wanna be is this the bespoke version for the hotel industry built by hotel investors of deal path plus an AVM plus, like, a pair of you. Right? So that you're you're to go cradle to grave and have it all there, and this is your command central. We don't know of anyone else that's doing it this way. But we but you may. I mean, we're we're not 100% up to speed on our competition. We know single pane is looking at it That's Michelle Russo. She's looking at it from an operational asset management So is CHM Warnick. Obviously, ProfitSoar just launched ProfitOwner so they're looking at it more operationally. We don't think this exists in the hotel deal space. We think we're a decade behind the broader commercial real estate space. And I know you guys, again, are a user of DealPath. You're a user of Juniper Square. You have Domino where you're trying to fill in the holes. And so to kinda maybe bring it round round about, this might, you know, reaching back out to you guys after our conversation in September, October, November because we this is a really good co founding team. I could not have asked for better co founders than Howard and Vinod. I'm glad I was as ignorant as I was going into it because watching this come to life over the last six months and watching Howard build this. We essentially gave all our Excel models to Howard and Howard created this. And now we're, you know, creating it and we're creating the software for it. But then with Drew and his hotel data, experience, and he really, really understands hotel data at a very granular level, his relationships. And then circle back to Mark Gordon, who is a broker, right, a former broker and an investor and a developer he's the face of capital markets for us so that there is actually you know, someone who's who's worked at the same level as our clients. As a sponsor and a broker facing the the hotel investment community. And we're we're excited about it. We think it has legs. But we definitely, as we walk through this, would love to have a collaboration with a group like Driftwood. Right? Because you're you're really ahead of us on a lot of this, plus Domino perhaps we could help you with Domino. We would love your all of your input into this, right, because your input will be so important as a leader in technology. And and that's where I where I wanted to just close out the conversation is circling back now that we're at proof of concept and reconnecting with you. No. I appreciate that. Thanks for thinking about us. Right? What I'll do as next step you know, is, you know, share the recording with Carlos junior. Because he obviously speaks with a lot more people in the hotel space than I do. I think it'll be good to get his perspective on, you know, what you guys are building, the UI headed, particularly around the network effect. Right? Having Mhmm. The various interested parties. I know either primarily touching this process or secondary or even tertiary. Right? Mhmm. Can I get that? Because that's what creates value. In this space in my mind. Right? It's not just my underlining model. It's how it relates to the rest of the world. Right. And how efficient you can make everyone's workflows. Right? And that's what that's what this is we're out to solve the pain point of in underwriting. So how should we leave it? Should I follow-up with you in a in a couple weeks or around Labor Day? What are your thoughts on, like, a potential next conversation or next step on this? Yeah. Labor Day would be really good, for sure. I know Carlos is gonna be out like, a week or so Mhmm. Starting mid this week. So you know, he's gonna be out of pocket, so I don't wanna, obviously, something in, you know, So and it'll also give you guys a little bit more time to have a few more conversations, kinda build this out a little bit. Then I think we could regroup and figure out where the overlap when I say overlap, right, where the synergies are. And then figure out how best to collaborate and take this forward. Okay. Alright. That's wonderful. Thank you for your time. And I and I know we showed you a proof of concept, but I felt like you would understand that we're at the proof of concept stage, but we have the team. To get it to MVP. So thank you for your time. And how how large is your development team? Your engineering team? Mhmm. Howard, do you wanna take that one?

### You (2025-07-21T19:56:37.733Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We we actually just brought on two new developers that started yesterday.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:56:42.405Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:56:43.923Z)

And, we are looking for a third. That's in addition to the node The node is an extremely talented full stack engineer. And the two that we brought on, one specializes in the front end, one on in the back end.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:56:58.725Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:56:59.803Z)

So we're gonna be working on that. One of the things to point out is, obviously, this this proof of concept is only available internally, but obviously, when we go to the we're gonna have full authentication. Probably, I I can't guarantee that we're gonna have SSO on day one.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:57:17.205Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-21T19:57:17.483Z)

But that is something that we want to implement very early in the process. And and how we're gonna structure the account and the user and and permissions, etcetera. That's that's something that we're gonna be working in addition to, you know, the fine tuning of the of the items that I pointed out today. So Yeah.

### You (2025-07-21T19:57:42.083Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-21T19:57:43.475Z)

as I follow Revere and all the things that they've done, it's it's almost like I can go back through their press releases and see, like, the initial capital they raised, the size of the team, when they got SOC two compliance. Right? And so having and you guys worked with them through that process. So it would be very wonderful for us to I mean, it's just would be a wonderful thing to have you as a collaborator on this. Fantastic. Yeah. Alright. Excited. I mean, it's a lot Looks like a lot of progress you guys have made in a really short amount of time.
