# Transcript for: InnVestAI - Howard + Sherban Intro

Yeah, it went well. He's adjusting, obviously. He's playing a lot of volleyball. Apparently you have to rec center, like the beach volleyball outside. So I joked with Maggie, who knew Matthew was such an avid volleyball player with his friends. And the roommate situation, how did that work out for him? So far so good. He went random. But there are three other guys. One guy was a last minute AD because they're won Quad member dropped out or didn't enroll. He ends up being like a second semester sophomore. And apparently he's never there. So he dropped his bag off. He doesn't even sleep there. So I'm like, good, well, you got to the facto triple in a quad instead. That's good. Well, I am so excited to introduce you guys to each other because obviously, Sherbet and I have a long standing friendship, and my husband and Sherman are best friends. So. Howard, like, the three of us go way back. We're born in the same little city. And Avon Lake, Ohio. Howard lives in Michigan. But I will all talk about the sit in a moment. But it's a really beautiful, idyllic little place to live. It's a wonderful small town. And Mike and Mike have been friends since literally, they were small children. Mike and 4 years old. And Shervin Howard and I met. I don't know, I think it was, like, two years ago when he was the product manager for ridicule. And again, you guys will both introduce yourself to that. I'm just setting the stage for this. When he was the product manager for Red IQ and I was. Furiously researching AVMs. A friend of mine who is a hotel broker named Jared Kelso, introduced us. And I was in craft with Howard from the very beginning. But since we've decided to partner last January or early February, Howard has become. Of all five of us, he is my most trusted and valued. Co founder. And I think Howard just brings this ability to be positive and realistic at the same time. And like you were talking about, making sure that it's balanced, that my exuberance and my upside. Right. How I think about things. Is it a balanced perspective? Howard somewhat plays that role sometimes, but, I mean, he gets exuberant, too. But to explain things like, hey, Diane, if Blackstone were ever to come invest in us, they would have the rights to kick us all out. Right? And so everything Howard says I value, and I'm so blessed every day that life circumstances worked out that we could be partners. And so I am excited to introduce the two. Of you because you both just really important people in my life that I respect so much. And so with that, I'm just going to start, if it's all right. Sherman, why don't you start? Do you mind? I kind of laid it out. We've known each other for a long time, but if you could tell Howard a little bit about your background, please take as much time, because this is really just to get to know you. Call. Your background and kind of your story and how it led to you owning your own business right now. Sure. And I don't know where you are in Michigan. Howard. I got my Harbor Springs quarter zip on. I love. We love Michigan. We go up to harbor every year on summer. And then my wife and I, we retire. We're probably going to retire up to Petoskey area. Bay harbor, that area when we just love it up there.

Paradise.

So, yeah, instead of going south, we are going further north. Yeah. As Diane said, we've known each other, her husband, since preschool, but I've known Diane since high school. I still live in the same town that we grew up in, although it's much bigger now, Diane, than it was when we grew up. I guess I have a little bit of what I would call an ADHD career, because I probably have a little bit of that. I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit and wanted to work for myself my whole career. But it took me 30 plus years to get to this point. I have degrees in engineering, law and mba. Not all at the same time. I graduated with an engineering undergrad, went in and did it. Business consulting with Anderson Consulting before they were Accenture, back in the 90s. So everyone who joins there starts off as a computer coder program, MER C or whatever, developing software for clients. Then went to IBM and did similar suffix of no coding. Just oversold the programmers and more client interfacing and designing the programs and laying out the projects. While at IBM. I went to night school. I got my law degree. When I left or when I graduated law school. I switched careers, became an attorney. Litigator. Business litigation. At first. A lot of banks, large corporations. And breach of contract tax cases. Then I was sort of wanting to use more of my technical side of my brain. I was getting bored with just the same old cases. So I took the patent barbecue with Pat attorney switched into our IP practice. And prosecuted a couple patents, but mainly did patent litigation. IP infringement cases, some copyright and little trademark, but mostly patent infringement cases. After about 13 years of large law firm life, as I put it, I was tired of that. So I went in house as general counsel, corporate secretary to 100% ESOP owned company. And our boss was my boss, the CEO who was one of the six selling shareholders. Who was still at the company. Handed me the esop documents, etc. Esop is broken. I don't know anything about esophagin. You have to fix it. So I just dove into the world of esop and learned everything I could. And these stuff is definitely broken and being poorly administered. So I fix that over a number of years, educated all the employees and sort of became all things esop to the company. And then I've worked with a couple esop trustees. And thought, there's definitely a lack of client service in the CSOP space, I think, from a trustee standpoint, and I think I can do it better. And so that was finally the moment that I said, I think I'm going to go off of my own and do my own thing. So I started my eso p trusty practice on the side in 23 while still working my other job and thinking if I could maybe get a client within 12 months. And pay the insurance premium some more and keep pursuing the stream, working for myself. That would be the plan. One day to leave the company, and the practice just exploded faster than I could imagine. And within four months, I'd quit my job. And I have been doing this ever since. Being in esop, Trustee. But my brain never stopped, I guess, coming up with new stuff to do. So especially day in after our conversations, I want to bring AI into the esop space. I think the Esolab world has a lot of complacency because there's so much work out there that everyone's just fat and happy and just going along to get along and doing the same thing. There's very little innovation. So I've registered about four more domain names last week and probably in 26. Start another LLC separate from my trustee practice to develop some software for the ESUB space. To bring more AI. I won't be coding it myself, although I do code as a nerd on the side in Python and in C sharp occasionally. And I'm taking a coursera, of course, now on IBM. Generative AI Engineering. Just because I'm a nerd, I like to learn new things. So I'm going to use that and then probably outsource the development of much smarter people than myself, but hopefully in the next year have another AI software product to roll out to not only my clients. The reason I'm doing it separately so I can hit other companies in the ESO space that have other trustees as their clients. So with that, I will pause.

### You (2025-08-29T13:08:49.503Z)

Very good. Yeah. Sounds like you and I have a very. I would say not a similar background, but definitely a similar path. So to satisfy my adhd, which I have fully documented by the doc, all the managers. I know the difficulties. And I wished that I had known earlier in my life than I did. Because looking back and it's like, oh, so that's why I kept job hopping, because I couldn't get. Right. But. Yeah. So I was born and raised, actually, over by Grand Haven, over there on Lake Michigan. So. Born and raised in Michigan, but lived in Texas and Colorado. For a lot of my professional career. My wife. She got a full ride to get her PhD at a university outside of Dallas. So after graduating college, which, by the way, my freshman year in 1980, I was a pre law degree. Until I saw 60 Minutes show that said 80% of all law school graduates at that time were bartenders because of the huge glut of lawyers. So I thought, no, that doesn't sound like a great career path for me right now. But, yeah, and it ended up going down the business. Business school route. And got involved with real estate. So I've actually been in commercial real estate for more than 30 years. And pretty much the entire time has been in the multifamily sector. So when my wife and I moved to Dallas, Dallas is really the hub. For commercial real estate. Just about every single real estate group is either based in Dallas or has a major office in Dallas. So that's where I started to kind of pick up on the commercial real estate side and actually started off in Michigan before we moved. As a site manager at an apartment complex. Started right at the very beginning. And it was owned by a company called Admiral Rosensons, which is very large in the Midwest. They are headquartered. The Detroit suburbs, but they have offices in Indianapolis, Kalamazoo in Ohio, few other places. And they have a very intensive training program where you literally start leasing apartments and running maintenance tickets. So I did that. There's very few people that have the background that I have. In the multifamily space. Where I literally started at the bottom, worked up, and then when I moved to Dallas, I got involved with asset management side of the business. Which fell very much in line with my finance and economics degree. I was more the back end money statistics analysis side than I was on plunging toilets and leasing apartments. So eventually worked my way up to vice president of asset management for a company called BH Management Services, which at the time was in the top 25 owners and operators in the US. Currently, I think their top 15, maybe even top 10, they've been growing significantly. So very large portfolio. But I got to say, I kind of hated my job. And this is where the ADHD comes in. Because people would ask me what my job does, and I would say, I sit around and I watch the paint dry on the walls, literally, right? We would buy apartments, renovate them, fix them up over a period of time, sell them, do it all over again. I always love the before and the after, but that in between was just hell. On earth. But I did actually have a pretty good reputation on the analytics side. And there's the largest software company. In the multifamily space called RealPage, based in Dallas. And so I had some connections there, and they asked me if I would like to come in and help guide the development of their sensory reporting product, which was their first attempt at a centralized database. Because the real page growth model is growth through acquisition. So they would buy all these different companies. But they would continue to operate fairly independently. So you had different data in all these different areas. But nothing connecting. Right. So it was the first centralized database data warehouse in the multifamily industry, where we were consolidating everything there. And that's when I got bit by the tech bug. And so I've been pretty much on the technical side ever since. And so on the product management side, I kind of come in more as the subject matter expert. Because, like you, I'm around technology, but I don't code. I don't understand or writing the code. But I do understand it. I always kind of say, well, it's like Spanish, right? I can kind of read it and understand, but I can't speak it. And so, same thing on the tech side, you know, I can look at a piece of code and I say, oh, yeah, I get where this is doing, but. I can't sit down and originate it. So that made me very helpful as kind of that bridge between the business side and the tech side. And so that's kind of where I got involved with that area in the end, product management. Spent many years. On the utility management side of the business with some of the largest providers in the industry. A lot of time more recently and the sustainability in ESG, working on that. But then in 2021, I was recruited by Red iq, which is the company Diane mentioned earlier. Red iq is the largest multifamily avm. The valuation model. In the industry. And had been around for quite a while. And I thought I'd been doing the utility thing for about seven or eight years. It was getting old. And I thought, this is perfect because it goes back to my asset management days and all those years I spent in asset management. Now I can kind of work with Red iq. And so we really took off at the very beginning where. As a valuation model, it served a purpose. From the time that the investor is aware that a deal is on the market to the time that that deal sells, and all of the process that goes in between. But once that deal is sold, There's not. No use for red IQ until you start another deal. Well, I noticed while we were there that a lot of that information pertained that you use in the acquisition also is valuable. While you manage and operate the deal. So we started to expand Red IQ beyond the acquisition and start getting into more asset management type of activities. We also did look into other asset types other than multifamily, and that's what I was introduced to, Diane, because we were looking at other areas. redIQ is owned by Berkadia Brcadia is the largest multifamily broker and loan servicer in the country, but very similar to cbre. Or jll. When you go around and you see these big wooden signs on an office building for sale, right? That's basically what Berkadia does, but it was all multifamily. But now they wanted to expand into other areas, and that's when they brought in Jared and set up a hospitality team. So Diane reached out. At that time, we were talking back and forth with, with the team. And I kept hearing Diane say, well, there's nothing like this in the hospitality space. Okay, but you really knew nothing about hospitality at the time. But to kind of wrap it up here, what happened is last August, just over a year ago, Berkadia sold Red IQ to a company called Radix, which is a multifamily data. Organization. And we thought this was going to be great for the organization because Red IQ had some good data. But was missing a lot of that data that I needed for that ownership period, which is what Radix had. But the timing was horrible. Real page that I mentioned earlier was facing a class action lawsuit for price fixing because they have a revenue management tool. And the revenue management tool aggregates all this data and says, oh, you should be charging X dollars for rent. And of course, it tries to push it. Radix got kind of caught up in that. Not that they were part of it. But we had clients that use both. And all they heard, all the clients heard was aggregating data is illegal. And that's not what it was. Real page takes aggregated data and then uses it to determine a price. Radix takes aggregated data and uses it to report to the user, saying, here's the average risk. Day and night, but the CEO basically panicked. Took all of the Red IQ resources, the engineers, developers, combine them with his and actually did a full pivot and came up with a new product, a different product. Which in the meantime, red IQ is just basically withering on the vine. And so in January, he basically shut down red IQ with the exception of keeping two engineers. To keep the lights on redIQ is still operating, but they're no more innovation. It's just basically they process the documents. And go from there. So that's when Diane reached out again, and I thought, this is pretty good timing. We were talking again, and she said, again, there's nothing like this. And I'm still skeptical because I'm thinking, wait a minute, there's a valuation model for every asset type out there. And you're telling me that there's nothing for it in a hotel? So I started digging in and researching. I'm saying. Crap, she's right. There is nothing like this in the hotel space. It's like, how did this get overlooked? So that's when we decided to go full in. So hopefully my experience in the commercial real estate space. When it comes to operating real estate, there's a common thread, no matter what the asset type is in terms of how its valued and what is the goal of the investor and et cetera. So being able to take all of that experience. Diane has many, many years in the hotel industry. Definitely an expert in that area. And so combining our strengths as well as the other three founders that we have, I think we have about as solid of a core team as we can possibly get. And so last part is Vinod Bat, who is our technology officer, was with me at Red iq. And so he's also very familiar with the back end process. How do you ingest a document, how do you extract data out of it? How do you process it? And I think that's going to really, definitely accelerate how we can get things going and get to market. So as my life story, in 10 minutes. But, yeah, excited to be here and I'm really. Pleasure to meet you.

### Guest (2025-08-29T13:22:25.655Z)

Yeah, nice to meet you as well. And so this is in Sherman, this is what we're doing different because the hospitality industry is investment industry. It lives in this little almost. I joke around about it. I call it the island of Granola because probably 80% of the people that work in hotel investing graduated from the Cornell hostel school, and they all know each other. There's two or three other hotels, schools. But it's a very interconnected group, and it's made more interconnected by the fact that we live and die mostly by branding. So hotels are branded Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, ihg. And that branding feature or process doesn't exist in other sectors like it does in hospitality. There's some of it in multifamily, like there's Post Apartments or Gables Apartments, but it's nowhere near the franchise model that exists in hospitality. And so what that allows us to do is while technically hospitality probably only represents 7 or 8% of the entire broader commercial real estate sector, multifamily being the largest, probably office second largest, we're the smallest at that small 6 or 7%. But in looking at our business is going to be very driven. By transactions because how many transactions happen in any year? And then we'll have a product eventually for the ongoing asset management. Just like Howard was mentioned with Red IQ and Radix and their goals. But the peak year for hotel transactions was 2015, and $35 billion of hotels transacted in the United States. And they probably had about two or two and a half percent of closing costs. Right. Broker fees, due diligence costs, and all of this is very manual. Plus the institutional asset management business where, like, I worked at Clarion Partners. And this is what Clarion did. They earned boatloads of money on acquisition fees. They earned 1% of AUM on anything they invested in. So as an example of that, our little teeny tiny hotel portfolio was three, bill. And so they earned $3 million a year just by asset managing that little itty bitty, you know, 200 hotel investment. They were investments. They were separate investments. Plus then there are disposition metrics like promotes and things like that that exist on the back end. So that constitutes truly billions of dollars of fees for the real estate industry. And it's just now starting to digitize. But these firms that have been attacking the digitization only attack, they attack all property types except hotels, because hotels are just hard and complex, and it's a small asset class. And they've been in existence. They all pretty much started a decade ago. But it took time for them to get their beta products out, and then they really pushed hard to have owner support, and that owner support help gave them help launch them. Right, because the owners got behind them and said, oh, no, Broker, you're going to use this. Oh, no, we need this. And then fast forward to AI and everything change. Just let you know the world has changed. Now people are like, okay, I need. I need to understand AI I need to understand how to use AI But I don't necessarily. What's an agent? I've never heard of an agent. What do they do? And even. Last week, we had a very. I don't want to call it intense, but it was a good intellectual conversation around nomenclature because I kept calling something an LLM, and Howard very kindly kept correcting me and saying, no, that's not what we need to call it anymore. Now it's really rag, like the retrieval technology. Right. And he explained it very clearly. But that nomenclature changed since, like, the first time I sat down and went to an AI. Went to a. An AI session. Right. They did call it LLMs back then, but now that language has changed completely. And the last area. I'll say, and this is what we're going to be working on as a team. Is. I'll use an example. I did that whole llc, and I used Perplexity to help me with it, and I just couldn't have gotten through it without an AI tool. Right. It was incredibly helpful to me. So now I understand that something that could have taken me to two weeks and would require, really, an attorney to work with me almost side by side, I could get done in four days. If someone asked me to go back and do it the old way. I would literally flip out. Like, what? I can't go back and do this the old way. Now that I know that there's so much about this is the point I want to make. How do you handle the security of that? Right, because everyone can't be sending their information up into the ChatGPT s and the clauds and the perplexity. I mean, that just becomes part of the fabric. Of general domain, general knowledge, and companies have secured data that they're not going to want. To get captured right in just a very open environment. And so security is going to be a huge part of our roadmap and figuring out, like all the other companies that are doing what we're doing. How we make sure that this is secure for our clients. So I don't know why I said that. It's probably just because the last week has been a very important week for me to internalize that one. I was using incorrect nomenclature, which means if I've studied this for years and I'm using the incredula claycher, then people who aren't as familiar with this. They have to be feeling an immense level of optimism, yet fear and stress at the same time about this. Does this make sense? Because this is such a big, dominating thing? And they're gonna want to use it. But when they start to really understand the security risk around it, it's going to be complicated. And that's what we want to help figure out for the people in the hotel industry. So I'm sorry I rambled on that, but this past week has been a very. I don't know when you call it like an emotional yet a logical journey for me, as I kind of thought through all of this. And just thinking this is really now how, I mean, an approach that we need to take with our clients is going to be maybe a little different than how this has been posed in the past by groups and other commercial real estate asset classes who've tackled the same thing. But the way we organize and pitch it to people is going to need to be very AI Speak AI driven in its presentation. Sorry. Totally. Yeah, I would agree with that. The one thing you have to. Especially if you're speaking to owners that aren't AI savvy. Is, you don't want to throw a lot of jargon at them. You don't want to start going, LLM R A G and all this, and the agents, and just break it down into simple English terms like, this is what it does. They don't need to know that it's an agent. Or it's called Rig vs. An LLM. They just need to know what you're going to do. Ironically, the AI could even help you with that. You upload your presentation and you can say, develop me a script or whatever that is like explaining this to a middle school or a high school student and it will dumb it down. Or you can say you're a board member reviewing this presentation. And your skeptical. So what questions would I be expected to get based on this presentation? One of my clients out of the blue? Sent me a book called the A Being an AI Leader. Talk about using AI as your thought partner. And I read it, and it completely opened my eyes. And the stuff that I didn't even know AI could do. And how it can just at every level of a company. Change. Like you said. How it can make something so quickly. And analyze your business plan. Where are the holes? And it'll say here. But you. Obviously, it's all in the prompting, as you know. But I would just say, yeah, if you're going to present to an owner group, you need to dumb it down, because with me, I understand the tech. I don't understand your hotel space. And when you get going and you're so excited and you're like, promotes aum. Over my head. I don't understand that world. I'm just like, okay, you know what you're talking about. You're passionate about it. It must be good. But I still don't understand. The pricing model. Because it is going to be a turf that is going to be well defended, right? I mean, every dollar you guys are taking out of this process, which sounds like everyone is fat and happy, which is probably why, like I was mentioning in my industry in the E subspace, Everyone's fan happy. There's no innovation, right? Everyone knows their role and everyone just is collecting the money and there's a lot of work out there. There's a lot of money and everyone's doing this. And now you guys come in and you're like, we're going to cut you out and we're going to take some of your fees because this section is going to be cut out all together. This section you're going to. Now, you may get fees, but you have to use us. So now some of your fees are coming to us. There's going to be a lot of pushback. And like you said, Diane, earlier, you need to sell the drivers of this product. The owners. Right. You need the owners to dead forces say, no, we're using this, guys, get on board and adjust. But there's going to be some pushback to it. The other thing I would say is if there's money to be made in the space, Someone is also going to try to get it. You're going to have to get in fast and first because it's not going to be long before. And maybe it's when you guys get to the size of maybe doing a Series A and now you're starting to get on the radar that these multifamily people that Howard been working with that have these models are going to be like, hey, maybe there's something to this over here. Maybe there's money to be made and Diane's billion, billion dollar pie that we only need, like, this much of, then they're going to be. Like and pivot over. And now you're racing as well. So those are the big picture things, you know, that always pop out to me.

### You (2025-08-29T13:34:55.663Z)

Yeah, that's a good point. So. And if Diane has already mentioned this to you, I apologize. But the AVM model is just to get our foot in the door. So the AVM model itself is basically taking what they do today in Excel and automating it. So if I'm an investor, I take all of these documents that I get from the broker. The historical financial statements, all of this other stuff, I would copy it and paste it into Excel. I would go through there. Know, I provided some information to the team about some studies that have been made about the Excel models that between 80 and 90% of them have an error in them. And so that's something that we would use in part of our marketing. But the idea is to get them to use the model, but the real value is the data. I mean, everybody's talked about this. And we've talked about some strategic partnerships with other data companies out there. I know Diane has had some conversations with them as well as Drew, so that we can immediately have all this data available to us where if all we were doing was depending on our users to upload that data, it would take years for us. To get the volume of data we would need. So I think that's one thing that's going to be very beneficial. If we can get in there, get those partnerships with the well known vendors out there that have that data, that's going to give us a little bit of a moat before other people come in. That is very integral part of our plan. AI obviously is a big part of the plan, but we're going to take baby steps. One of my favorite sayings is the riddle, how do you meet an elephant? One bite at a time, right? So we can't just jump in and start offering these great things. But there are some low hanging fruit that we can do right off the bat. Number one, we could give them like the AI summary that you mentioned before. You can just push a button and it can print out an investment package. So if I'm an investor and I have to go to a committee and get approval in order to acquire this, we can make that very easy. They don't know they don't have to sit down in Microsoft Word. And type out a 20 page document. Kind of the reverse of that is One thing that GPTs are very good at is kind of backing into numbers. So if I am looking at a deal. And I have my investment partners have certain thresholds that have to be met before they will invest, and I can't quite get the deal there. Typically, what they're going to do is they're going to hunt and peck. They're going to say, okay, well, what if I reduce my salary or my labor expenses. Will that do? And they kind of keep going off. It would be very simple to have a GPT connected to the database and the model and say, listen, I need to have these particular hurdles. What can I adjust or what can I change in the model? What are some of the assumptions? Just like that, it's going to come up with a list of suggestions. More long term would be like the agentic use and I've already demoed for the team. How that could possibly work. By. I put together a prompt and I used a tool, and I took a hotel that I used to stay in, quite frankly, when I had office in Costa Mesa, and it's a boutique hotel, and I just put in, here's the hotel, here's the address, blah, blah, blah. Give me the comps, give me previous sale history, give me tax information. And then just a couple minutes, it spit out this beautiful report. And it had, here's the previous sales, here's the tax records. Here's the comps. And I knew the market well, and I'm like, that's right. Those are the right comps. This is it. So that's not too far off. But again, the whole idea is we want to make this a tool that not only can they use to underwrite, but also for the asset managers. To continue using the tool all the way until the day they sell the tool and be able to go out and get these reports from different data areas. And one of the things that hit me, within a couple weeks of working with Dianas, we had a phone call where we talked about COSTAR and the COSTAR data. They are the largest real estate data. Base out there. They serve basically every industry out there. And somebody mentioned that if I'm buying a hotel, And I need data on the cops. I would go to CoStar and I say, here's the list of properties. And they charge like $3,000 and it takes one to four business days to get a PDF. And I'm like, one to four business days. We can just push a button and have that exact same data come out. If we had access to that data. And then I found out the data that they have is just basic operating data. There's nothing. There's no secret sauce, there's nothing magical about it. So one of the things I hope to accomplish is at least even early in the day, Early in the game. Is when these users are providing their data to CoStar. Send us a copy. We probably wouldn't ask them to send us their costar data. But we would put together something in our tool that has the exact same data fields. And just say drag and drop that document into our tool. And you don't have to do anything, just upload it. And then we would have that same data along with the data that we have from our users, along with our third party partners. And I think we would be able to not only be the first avm, but we would be like the source of hospitality data in the industry.

### Guest (2025-08-29T13:42:00.855Z)

Yeah. And I sent Diane a very similar email. I think after we talk is one of the things that I love about Diana in this is she. 's so passionate, and she just gets going and going. And then the email to me. Could you explain it? We're going to do this and this and this. I'm like, dang, you got to. What are you going to do first? You got to get in. You got to get your first product done. And aftermarket. Don't wait until you get the whole huge thing built, like, chunk it up. And then you're going to have users give you changes and suggestions just on that product. We wish it could do this, or can it do this? And you're going to be busy tweaking and then there's going to be bugs and hiccups. Which I think I'd be a great user test for you, since I don't know the industry, and I'd be plugging stuff in and you're going to. Oh, no, you don't usually put that in there. Well, I don't know that that's what breaks here, your software's. Got to take. Because being a former programmer early in my career and developing those tests. Yeah, it's easy to develop a test where I know a number's got to go in here and the word's going here, and you just change what goes in and it works. And then you give it to someone else and they go, oh, I'm going to put something else here. And it blows up your computer. And you're like, what just happened? So you're going to have that in running in parallel. So you're going to have engineers doing what your existing rollouts and enhancements while you have. Then, okay, what's next? And how are you going to layer all that on? Together. Yeah, I center that same email a couple like right after we talked, because she gets going with her passion. And the one thing, though, Diane. I would also say is, as a company, you guys obviously have to tap that security issue. But don't feel personally overwhelmed. You do not need to know how to tackle that issue. But no, that's the nose job, right? You just need to know it's an issue that we're going to tackle. Don't get overwhelmed or go down that rabbit hole to try to figure it out for him. That's his job. Delegate that to the node. We got this security issue figured out, and then. That is sort of where you can then move on to the next higher level task that needs to be done. I do know that we're going to need SOC 2 compliance. That's like at a basic. I mean, right, Howard? I mean, we're going to be dealing with large financial institutions, and large financial institutions require SOC to compliance. And so how you actually, I know. I mean, I've researched it, the cost and things like that, how you actually go about getting it. I don't. That's something I don't know. So you're right that my old company, we had to get socked too. We were not soc. Maybe we were soc. One or two. It was one of the socks. And because we had client data for large refineries. ExxonMobil, Shell, and then also. And they were like, okay, you need. Our clients started saying, you know, this could be stock two client. Client. We had to bring in a consultant. It was like, 60 grand. It takes months and months and months. For them just to do their audit. They have questions and questions about every governance. And what are your delegation policies? It is detailed. We finance operations. All these areas of your company. Big spreadsheet. They do it on spreadsheets. Break spreadsheets. You got to answer all these questions, provide examples, provide PDFs, provide backups of everything that you are saying. And then you get sort of like an initial. Yep. But you don't get SOC2 complaints yet because they come back, like, six months later. And now they like, okay, they re audit you. Like, are you living what you've told us? Blah, blah, blah. And then it's like, okay, now you're SOC 2 compliant. Like it is a long process. It takes up a lot of internal resources. If it's just the five of you, it's going to take a bubble. It's going to take definitely time away from your day to day work. To just come to answer all these questions. It is tedious, but, yeah, it's not a fun process to go through. But it may be a necessary, like you said, it may be necessary. I'm absolute positive of it. And then there's probably going to be new security that we've never even thought of as an industry come out of how AI needs to be. How the use of AI Needs to be guardrailed for company and protection. Because part of our five year roadmap as well. Is Howard mentioned we're putting our foot in the door. We're getting our foot in the door with the valuation. The underwriting. I should just call it underwriting. Right? Underwriting happens on every single deal. You always have to go back and compare to pro forma over and over and over. But from that. Base, then that's not the only. I'll call it workflow in owning a real estate asset. There are workflows around legal. Right? And that's all being digitized. There's a platform called Harvey that is probably the leading legal. AI Platform right now. A law firm. Latham Watkins just signed an enterprise agreement with Harvey. And they have a very big hotel transaction team. Right. So we want to make sure we're understanding what's happening there, because the negotiation process of purchase and sale agreements, management agreements, franchise agreements. If I didn't say this. Joint venture agreement, right, all of that. Even just term sheets? If you do a term sheet these days, That all is very important and it's time consuming. So we want to make sure we have those workflows kind of coming in somehow into our platform. So it's like a one central source of truth where you can just. And that's an overused term, but where you can find all of this. And it's not just in your inbox. Capital is another big time intensive workflow. Berends will require renovations, hotels when they change hands. And so These could be 10 million dollar renovations where the GCs are using, for the most part, a platform called Procore. And so how do we partner with Procore? Right, so that we can start to pull up all those renovation workflows and maybe create a bridge that captures the hotel specific data, but that becomes a module. And this is a five year maybe plus roadmap. And then the third that I'm incredibly focused on is the closing process, because the closing process is the manual process. And this is where you go through. Okay? Now, you've done your underwriting, you go hard on your deposit, you have 30 days. To close all your financing in place, and then you go into the final day of closing. And as a transaction person myself. I just know how stressful this is, right? There are things that always pop up on closing day. Some dispute about something and you get really stressed. But then you have to do the HUD or the closing statement and you put your purchase price, you pay out all your cost. It's just like buying a house, right? And then the day, it's like, okay, is the money. Did the wire come? Is the wire out? It's usually like Friday at a 3 o'clock and it runs like, oh, please, let the wire hit, let the wire hit. But why I'm so focused on that statement itself is so valuable to us from an information.

### You (2025-08-29T13:50:09.023Z)

Perspective. Because it has an actual.

### Guest (2025-08-29T13:50:11.015Z)

The actual purchase price on it. Right. So if the purchase price information and you can be part of that digitized closing process and this is in our five year roadmap. And you have the underwriting so you know what the actual income is of the property. You now have cap rate information. And real estate is a very. I mean, we live and die by cab rates. It's such a big part of our DNA. People right now call around and they say, what was the cap rate of? That deal. And the challenge with that is, well, how do you define what a cap rate is? Is it the trailing twelve income? Is it the future income? Is it some adjusted income? Does it include the capex or does it not include the cap? Does this making sense? And so you're never really getting accurate cap rate information when you do this? Kind of like call my buddies and get it. So real, honest to God, cap rate information could be a huge step for us in using. As Howard said, it's about the data, right? When we collect the data and then if we have the cap rate information, And it's accurate. How we apply that to the future valuation modules and things like that that we have would just be really, really valuable to us. But now, let me tell you, Sherman, is this is where Howard comes in and he plays the devil's advocate for me, right? Because Howard and I have had this conversation, and he understands my exuberance. Around this. But Howard will tell me very calmly. That's wonderful, Diane. But remember, when we start actually having clients, the workflows that are important to our clients. And they want to prioritize. Maybe different than the workflows in your own head. Right. Like what I think is critical. Our clients may have a different view. And so it's really incumbent on us. To just make sure we're developing a product that our clients want and we're prioritizing the features in our roadmap that they want. Not that necessarily, I think, are the most critical. You have this five year roadmap out in your. I don't know if it's in your head or if you actually have it on paper. But what do you want to accomplish this year? Because you mentioned. I heard you mention. Well, I don't think it's going to happen because I thought I heard an MVP by Labor Day. But that's Monday, and I don't think you're going to get something double on Monday. What is the shortest amount of timeline before you can get a working product of whatever it is. And even that functionality is still going to improve over time, right? It doesn't have to be perfect. It can't crash, but you can add additional data or functionality or tweak it better over time. That's why XL today looks a lot different than Excel when it came out from Microsoft first. Every software package out there is every year. That's why you get oh, we got updates, summer security updates and Some are enhancements. And so what is your, like, your mvp, Your minimum viable product? What is that going to be, and what's the timeline to get that developed and rolled out? Yeah, we were just talking. That's what maybe the focus of our. We have two calls every week. We talked a lot about that last night. Howard, you're probably better and more succinct at explaining this than I am, because I know you and Vinod. You've mapped it out on a piece of paper, and you and Vinod are talking. So one thing before I ask Howard to explain this is we have some bottlenecks right now. And the bottleneck exist in that there's five of us. And Howard, we're incredibly fortunate. Howard Spence, all of his time on InnVestAI. Like, all of it. I mean, not even a full 40 hour. Like, he spends all of his hours working on this. The node. Is younger. He has small children. These are Chief Technology Officer. He has a full time job so he is doing his work. Off the corner of his desk at, like, 11:12, 1am in the morning. And we have engaged three very young software engineers in India that we pay $500 a month. It's incredibly small. They're young, they're good. They're good at Python, they're good software engineers, but they know nothing about real estate. And so we have a bottleneck happening where they're doing work, but Vinod has a full time job and so they do work and then by the time he comes to review it, we're not as efficient. As we need to be there. And Howard is going to step in and try to play a role that's more like the traditional product manager, where he's working more with those software engineers. But the bottleneck with Vinod is one we have to deal with because we have to get him working on this full time. We can't keep having him have another full time job because it's just slowing us down too much. And this is all. And I really am. However, I'm going to turn this over to Howard in a moment. Drew, Mark and I were more on the hotel business side. Right. So the fundraising and the sales and going out and talking to clients. And trying to figure all of this out. But last night, we had our one more piece of backstory, and that is that Mark Gordon, who were incredibly fortunate to have on our team. He's a former hotel broker, and I will call him the face of capital market. If I could just use. Please forgive my speak here. But he is the Hebro, right? He is the pe. Hey, bro. That will resonate with all the hebros in the hotel investment space. But Mark is. I would call him affluent. He has two homes. He's had a very successful, long career. And so in Mark's mind, it's like, well, no, we just need to all keep working like we are until we have this MVP product done. Our challenges. We're going to start. If we don't start, things are going to start to crumble if we can't bring the node in full time. And thank you Sherbren, so much for your investment. Right, but we need a few other degree in evaluation of first, the money's not wired. Yet. But that's. But let me ask this, and it's going to come off a little harsh. Why Vinod? What specifically about him? Makes him a founder that you need and not just some other data architect technology guy. Well, he was@red IQ. And so this is being in real estate and having a real estate background in this is unique. If this makes sense, right? We could pool another software engineer. But the nose knowledge of working with real estate is very important. Second is that Howard and Vinod have a long standing working relationship and so they don't have to develop that. From scratch. Organically new, right? It's already baked into their DNAs at this point. And so when we can free the nodes, time. The fact that Howard and Vinod already know how to work together extremely well and that the Node understands real estate. That is what's critical. But. I'm sorry, Howard. I just totally rambled. Rambled? You're actually probably much better to just go back and say what's in the next six months, what's in the next year. Maybe you could speak to why Vinod and how we're thinking about this first initial 6 to 12. Months.

### You (2025-08-29T13:59:02.143Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So let me address the Vinod question first. Vinod. As it is. Diane mentioned he worked with us at Red iq. He understands the business part fairly well for an engineer. Not gonna lie. I mean, yes, we could hire another engineer to come in, but there would be fairly lengthy period of breaking them in. One of the things that stands out about Vinode is number one, he is a full stack engineer. He can do it from A to Z. Right? So he's not just focused on one particular area. He also has a design background, which makes it very convenient. I mean, we were talking, you know, a few months ago about you know, let's put together an InnVestAI website, and then a couple days later, boom. Benod's got something there with a nice logo, nice setup. I'm like, wow, this is, you know, pretty impressive. So I think he brings that to the table. But the biggest challenge. That anybody has to come in here is the extraction of the data from the documents you get from the broker or the seller, etc. He was very instrumental. One thing about Red IQ is it was the largest. We had almost 60% market share. But it had very old technology, so that when a user uploaded the financial statement, everything that we did was rules based. And so most of the time they're Excel. A lot of the times the investor would get this, and they might change the name of a column to something that they're used to using instead of what's in there. And so when they upload that, all of a sudden, boom, it blows up because rent is now rental amount or something that they change. So he and I work together and this is where the Radix acquisition actually benefited. We had some very good data scientists with Radix and we were able to kind of move away from the roles base and use AI and get into the more machine learning. So we weren't getting into the rules engine so that's a lot of the value that he brings is the experience of. Making a tool that can extract the data that doesn't have to be formatted. In a specific way. Right. And so that's probably the biggest reasons why I think he is best for this position. Honestly, it has nothing to do with our backgrounds or that we work together. I know his background. I know it makes it easier. But at the same time, I know that he has the skills needed to get this thing off the ground. So that's the big thing with why Vinode. But as far as the roadmap, again, you got to get that core product right from the very start. If we have a bumpy road, If somebody uploads a document and the data is messed up. Not going to give you a second chance. So you're right. We did initially want to get this thing out the week after Labor Day. But I think realistically, we're looking at the end of the month. We're not talking about another 90 days. The team that we have in India, they're doing a very good job. I put together proof of concept. And like I said, I'm not a coder, but I use lovable, and I'm a junkie now for these no code tools. I mean, I've used lovable, replit, bold. I mean, you name them, I've built something on them. So I was able to actually build a working proof of concept. Using these tools so they're not coding from scratch. And these no code tools. They don't put out the cleanest code. It works, but it's not sustainable, et cetera. But at least they know what it is and what we're trying to accomplish, and they can clean up the code. And that's one reason why I think we're getting it knocked out the door. Knocked out of the door? Than we would if I were to just destroy the PRD document, Show them mockups and wireframes. And they have to go out and build it. It would be early 2026 before we could get something out the door. So once we get that initial core AVM where I can upload a document, Extract the data. Get in there. Input my assumptions as a buyer or an investor. And have an accurate valuation come out. Once you extract that data, it's just math. Right. There's no magic. No magic formula. It's just you put in what, your assumptions when you put in your cap rates, your interest rates. How long is it. Is it going to be interest only? Is it good? Blah, blah, blah. You fill in the. You fill in the blanks and you get evaluation. That is our core. Mvp that we can get out. By the end of September. And then we're going to have what we're going to call closed beta session, where we've already we, Diane Drew, have already reached out to some people they know that will basically do some side by side testing where they're going to continue to use their models that they've used, but also plug in the data in ours and make sure everything works well. So before we just go out to any investor, we're going to have kind of an internal test beta period that'll go on for 30 to 60 days. And then during that time, obviously, we'll be taking their feedback whatever they find. I'm not so concerned about the output. I'm concerned about the user journey. I want to make sure that it's very natural. For them. That without any training. That the tool is so intuitive that they know that this is where I start and I put in these inputs and this is where I end up. That's where I really want to get some feedback on, is to make sure we get that right. Also, we have already identified six or seven very unique Personas of our users. Right, so we've got the broker. Who will use the tool to come up with what he thinks the property is worth, and then he'll go to market. Obviously the investor, but we've also identified it appraisers. Lenders, loan servicers and asset managers, right? Each one has a specific use of the tool that differs from the others. But we know that lenders, loan servicers, and impossibly, even appraisers. They don't need to get into the minutia. Right. So when they're looking at the financial statements, they're looking at the top level of food and beverage is a line item. But food and beverage is made up of. Is it a kiosk? Do they have formal dining? Is it all these different subcategories where an investor might want to get down to that very bottom line? And really get in there and tweak them minutia. Whereas the servicer or the lender, they only care what the top line food and beverage is. So we want to start with that, because if we can get the top line down, you can imagine this is just like an accordion type of process where, okay, if we can get that food and beverage down, it's really simple to get those line items, because now all I have to do is maybe click a button and have it expand like. Oh, well, there's the subcategories. Right? And then I can go from there. So we are rolling it out in a very methodical way. Of getting those internal testers. Or I should say partner beta testers. And they're not internal. They don't work for us. Getting them in there, getting that feedback very quickly. Making sure that we can do those incremental processes to get it to the core. As well as having some of those AI features that I mentioned before. And then our roadmap from that point is to grow it to get those more detailed line items as we need. Looking at some additional AI features, like I mentioned with the market. And then there are some other things that we would eventually. It is possible with the technology today. Where we could have somebody upload the documentations and not have to do anything. They could go out and we could get the market data and it would come back with averages. Right. The data that we get would be aggregated and anonymized. So I can't say, well, I'm buying Hyatt here, and here's a Hilton that's three blocks away. All I'm going to know is in that particular area, here's the average of the room rates and everything else. But then you could do 80, 90% of the work within seconds, and all they need to go is and tweak and come up with their particular scenarios. That is something that we probably be about for that.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:09:09.095Z)

That was something. That was something that I don't want to distract you from your roadmap, from your current schedule. Because I like that my ADHD kicks in, and I'm like, oh, it'd be cool if it did this.

### You (2025-08-29T14:09:25.983Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:09:27.495Z)

I figured the users would. You give them the model and then it comes out and they're like, well, what if I turn tweak this? Then how does that change? And instead of having the user s tweak those items, The model. Phase two, not the MVP but face later. Don't get distracted. Could run its own sensitivity analysis for them and say here it is. And then it automatically tweaks. Whatever. Maybe they just click. I only want to tweak this. And then it runs. Okay, that one up 5 or decreased 5% now. Here's, here's what happens to the model. And so therefore, the user is not just doing it. It's click. He or she's clicking these variables. Run sensitivity analysis button, boom. And then it goes to another, and it starts doing that for them. And then maybe they can see the optimized, like, oh, this is this and this is this. This is the optimal value for me because with these three variables, setting almost like a goal seek in Excel, like these three variables are.

### You (2025-08-29T14:09:50.863Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:10:30.855Z)

We got great feedback from a lender, too, or a woman that works in the data and structured finance base. That kind of like that idea of a goal seek. Right. Like lenders look at the information in a very different way than an owner or a broker would because they're managing risk and risk downside. Right? And so it's almost like backing in to how much cushion they have in the numbers. Meet their risk threshold. And so when we did the demo with my friend Kara, She brought a lot of the same things up. Shervin. We're always kind of, like, cheating and just trying to like. She didn't say the word goal seek, but it's kind of the same thing, like, goal seek into. This is the cushion we have in this loan before we exceed what our risk. Thresholds are. And that's different than how an owner looks at it in some ways. Right? Because an owner isn't looking at the risk, they are looking at risk, but they're really looking at upside, opportunity. Right. That's what they're focused on versus what a lender is looking on, which is downside risk.

### You (2025-08-29T14:11:51.183Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:11:52.535Z)

Well, I'm happy to hear that it's not Monday, but it is this month. I thought it would be far, even farther than that. So I'm glad that it is close like that. And I agree with your approach to bring in what you call the internal beta, like the people who are actually going to use it. Sort of sneak preview like, hey, Berkadia, try to use it.

### You (2025-08-29T14:12:07.743Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:12:24.135Z)

Or maybe bring in someone like me who knows nothing about it to see does it survive. The brain. The numbers don't matter. The deal would never get done at these numbers. It doesn't matter. But is it going to kick you to blue screen, so to speak? The old, the old speed. Is something going to happen where it's going to just crash and now the user is like, what just happened? That was the other thing.

### You (2025-08-29T14:12:47.983Z)

Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:12:49.095Z)

Make sure you have all those exceptions handled and all that.

### You (2025-08-29T14:12:52.943Z)

I would love to schedule another call if you want to go into a little bit more detail on the roadmap. Things like the sensitivity analysis is on the roadmap and it's actually one of the earlier things. It's not difficult to do. You could do a simple matrix. I also sent a sample. Where you could actually have sliders on the screen and just sit there. Instead of plugging in a number and watching it, you could slide it up or down, see what happens there. There's a lot of different ways we can approach that. But, yeah, there's a lot of different things that we could do. And I was just thinking of something a minute ago that you had mentioned that when we talk about partnering, I'm sure it'll come back to me, but, yeah, there's a lot of things that we can do with our partner data. Oh, one of the things as well. I mean, we're even looking, like, maybe three years out or so. One of the things I did earlier in my career is I did some consulting with a couple of multifamily due diligence firms. That were basically trying to automate the due diligence process. And one of the things we talk about, it's come up a lot over last year we were talking about it@Road IQ, is these companies that claim that you can just upload your multifamily rent roll and operating statement. And we'll give you evaluation in 90 seconds. And I'm like, wait a minute. What you're going to do is you're going to give me the market averages, so you're going to give me use the average occupancy and the average rents and give me an average valuation. It's not going to be there. And who in their right mind is going to go and drop $75 million on an apartment community without doing an inspection, right? Well, one of these companies that I consulted with, it was done a few years after I did the consulting, so I wasn't involved. But during Covid is what brought it up is they did create a way where you could do everything. Using the camera. And what they would talk about is instead of having maintenance guys go into an apartment before a resident moves out to doing a damage inspection, Just let the resident do a FaceTime call and say, okay, can you show me under the sink here? Can you show me the carpet in the dining area? Right. And they would show it in AI now can kind of spot. These issues and pull it up. There's drone inspections for the roofs, the physical layouts. This isn't something we would develop. That takes millions of dollars and hardware. But if we could partner with those types of companies, You're very broad. Initial number the AI Would come up with could be narrowed down quite a bit if you do something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:16:05.095Z)

So I have one more question. I have a 1030, so I still have some time. I do have a stop at 10:30, but the internal beta test going, if that all goes well. When do you think the first product is ready to market, that you're going to start generating revenue?

### You (2025-08-29T14:16:27.263Z)

We would be looking at the most 60 to 90 days. So we think we could get something.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:16:34.215Z)

From now or after the beta test.

### You (2025-08-29T14:16:37.503Z)

From the time that we go to the beta market. So let's just say we are ready for that beta testing the first week of October. We're thinking 60 to 90 days from there, so probably January.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:16:52.455Z)

Okay? So it doesn't have to be that precise. So first quarter of 26. At some point. Okay. Okay?

### You (2025-08-29T14:17:00.703Z)

Because we already know some items. So the way we've got it broken down is I built the poc they're working on the mvp. And then version one is what we're going to consider our first external and then I've got another section called version 1.1. And another thing that is beneficial with Vinod and I working together is we know the cadence. And it's just like you mentioned before, Agile Project Management, while they're building here. I'm working with people and looking forward. So whatever the engineering team is working on is something I've already done. It's beyond that. And then we keep going on. But when they're done with one feature, they just start going on another. It's not like you have to wait 90 days and then, boom, everything goes out. Wait another 90 days. I mean, we could be releasing something daily. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:17:54.295Z)

So I definitely, back in the early 90s, grew up in software development, which was like you said, the waterfall, right? Get all the user requirements, build it, test it, and then show it. And now everything's schedule. The only I caution all my clients to for this when I was an attorney because I've been involved in more than one lawsuit involving agile development software methodology. Representing both the developer and a company being on both sides. My personal bugaboo about Agile is you develop. You develop it, you show it to someone, and then everyone's always tweaking it. Oh, wouldn't it be cool if it did this? Yeah. And the developer's like, yeah, we'll build whatever you want. And nothing gets completed because everyone wants to. Make it perfect.

### You (2025-08-29T14:18:42.143Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:18:42.375Z)

And it just stays there and scrum after scrum after scrum. And then that's usually when the client is suing the developer. You didn't deliver your product on time, and they're like, well, your guys kept telling us to change stuff, and this happens and everyone sues everyone over I'VE been involved more than one of those suits. So just scope. Creep is got. When you do agile, just make sure you're like, no, this is all we're building now. Yes, that will be cool later. But we're not building that now.

### You (2025-08-29T14:19:07.903Z)

Right. It takes discipline. And yeah, what you're describing would be very typical for a third party agency who builds software on behalf of somebody else. And time commitments. When we're building our own tool. We don't have that issue. But another thing that I want to point out is we could talk about waterfall, agile, scrum, safe, all these different methodologies. I don't subscribe to any of them. My mind is. Excuse my language. Just get the shit out the door, right? I don't care what label you want to put on it. When you're a small team, we can do that, right? If I've got a team of 100 developers, man, maybe it gets a little chaotic.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:19:46.775Z)

Yeah, I'm the same way. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-29T14:19:55.663Z)

But we're not to that point yet.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:19:58.055Z)

Good. Good. Yeah. So.

### You (2025-08-29T14:19:58.063Z)

So we're not using. We don't even talk about two week sprints. It's just like, let's just keep on going and if something's ready, it's ready. And then we go on to the next. That's why I actually did break it down. And we know that we're going to do this first, and that's a great idea. I love what you've got for this particular feature, but we're not going to get to that until maybe six months from now. Or a year. Right? So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:20:26.775Z)

Yeah, I like what I hear. As I've told Diane, her passion for it also sells it as well. And, yeah, So that you're close to beta testing the product. We can agree on evaluation, then I'd be willing to invest. And I don't know if you guys even have the bank account set up yet, though, because I know you just got the operating agreement. Done. And then who's going to be on that? But so once, if we can agree on that valuation, and then you guys get the bank account set up, just let me know and I can wear the funds over.

### You (2025-08-29T14:21:12.143Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:21:13.815Z)

Are you familiar with from the safe agreements from why? Incubator or Y Combinator? It's the simple agreement for future equity. That would be the mechanism that I would want to invest under, which is, here's the money. I get no equity right now. I get nothing. You just get the money. And then it's when there's a triggering event. Typically in this case, when you guys go do a price series A or series whatever, a price value, then that's when my investment would convert into natural shares. But Y Combinators got the form agreement on their website, if you ever want to look at it. And it was put in place because of its name. Simple agreement for feature. Like, there's no shares right now. I'm not getting any shares with this first investment until there's that next triggering event, so. It takes a little bit of trust on my part, because if you guys never raise capital and you guys go out of business, then I never got equity, so I don't saw anything like that. But if you're comfortable with that type of agreement, that would be the easiest. It doesn't involve lawyers or anything. Like that. And then we've also talked as a group about, like, you having maybe a bit more involvement at an operating level. Right. And maybe some other investors would and more active involvement. And we embrace that how I think will probably maybe the next few steps are we want to introduce you to the entire team so you get to know, all five of us, we're all very different individuals with very different skill sets, and that is a good thing in how we've set things up. But at the end of the day, Howard and I kind of exist as the core, right? I work with Drew and Mark on the business side and Howard works a bit more with Vinod on the technical side. And we all talk, but at the end of the day it's hard and I are linkage that keeps pulling things through back and forth. So you'll have the most conversations with us like we're having today as we roll through this. And if it's weekly or biweekly or monthly or ever, how you want to set it up. And then they'll be also times when you talk to all of us and get a sense of kind of where all of our heads are. But we appreciate that the technical background that you have, a legal background that you're interested in, an AI and that again, we have to figure out an evaluation that's 100% not lost in this conversation. But we really appreciate your willingness. To take a bat on us. And we hope that as we learn about AI Maybe some of that can come back to you as well and help you in your ESOP business, because you'll be plugged into some of the things that we're doing or some of the things that we're following, right? As we follow our competitors. And try to make sure we understand what they're doing. That some of that information or all of that information gets relayed back to you, and it helps you think about how you want to deploy AI in your eSoft business. Okay. Yeah. And, Howard, where do you live now? In Michigan. Like, what part of Michigan?

### You (2025-08-29T14:24:35.183Z)

I'm actually about three hours away from the Bay Area. I'm in Rockford, which is just north of Grand Rapids.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:24:41.815Z)

Okay? I have two clients in Grand Rapids and then I have one in Ann Arbor and one in Macomb as well, so I've been through that area as well. Know, I knew there was the north downstate, obviously connection, but until I got my first client in Grand Rapids. I didn't know there was, like, a western, eastern Michigan divide, too. They're like, oh, west Michigan. I was like, oh, I didn't know there was that divide.

### You (2025-08-29T14:25:14.223Z)

The west, central and east. That's the easy part. But everybody talks about up north, but nobody knows we're up north. Starts.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:25:23.895Z)

Nd it's wherever their vacation house is. So that's up north.

### You (2025-08-29T14:25:27.903Z)

If you live in Indiana, it could be Traverse City. If you live in Michigan, right?

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:25:32.935Z)

Yeah, exactly.

### You (2025-08-29T14:25:33.983Z)

But. Yeah. No, my wife and I tried to get over to the Bay Area at least once a summer. We haven't had a chance to get there this year, but I'm a biker. We used to bike all the way around the bay up to Harbor Springs. Spent some time in town and go back down to Traverse City. Beautiful, beautiful area. I just saw something a couple days ago, what they're calling the Golden Triangle. I've never heard it referred to that. That before, but kind of Charlevoix Torch Lake up to Harbor Spring, or actually, that whole area. Some of the highest valued real estate in the country.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:26:12.695Z)

Yeah, believe me. I'm unrealier. Com every day looking. And I'm planning for this because my wife, she's a teacher. My son just. We just dropped him off at Ohio State two weeks ago. And when he's my youngest. So when he graduates college, My wife's like, I'm retiring. And so in 29 that's when we are going to then probably make the move up north and get rid of prop, maybe get rid of this place from who knows if Emma's still here, maybe keep it. But yeah, between now and then I am on realtor. Com all the time. I have a realtor up there, sending me alerts all the time, just. And it is very expensive, and it's very expensive to build up there. It is. One of the developers called it. It's the Hamptons of now the Midwest. There's a lot of New York money that has discussed. Chicago already knew about it, but now New York knows about it. And Traverse City Airport on a weekend is nothing but private jets. I mean, they are just flying out and it's driving up all the prices. So it is expensive.

### You (2025-08-29T14:27:15.823Z)

But. It is one of the few places in Michigan that is really truly a year round area. I grew up over by Grand Haven, and it was one of those things, that most beautiful place from May through September. And then after that, it was just a ghost town. And December. But up north, I mean, you've got the ski areas, but it's also, if you're a golfer, it's got some of the best golf courses in the country that a lot of people don't read. I mean, pretty much every pro that you've heard of has designed a course up there. It's gorgeous area. I can understand why it's commanding that price.

### Guest (2025-08-29T14:28:03.575Z)

Yeah. I'm just hoping for a dip in a couple of years. I'm looking for that one divot. I'm like, that 'll lie and then go back up. I don't care. But, hey, it was really nice meeting you. Howard and Diane, always good to see you and hopefully with you guys again. I enjoyed it. And, yeah, hopefully we can keep working together. I like that. Okay, great. All right. Thank you. Bye. Thank you.
