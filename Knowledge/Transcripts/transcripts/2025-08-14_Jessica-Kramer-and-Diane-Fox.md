# Transcript for: Jessica Kramer and Diane Fox

### Guest (2025-08-14T21:01:00.944Z)

Nothing quite so exotic. Yeah. What's nice there as well? Hey, jessica. Hi. How are you, Diane? Great. Nice to see you, too. Are you back on the West Coast? I am back on the East Coast. East coast? Recording in progress. On the Lower east side in New York, but I was on the west coast, so I usually am out in Silicon Valley. About one week a month and then I typically take my weekday of working there and I do a little San Francisco to see my sister and brother in law and their two toddlers and then I do rounds and go down to Southern California and see my Berends So a little bit of end cap and then the rest of the month. I'm off duty from family for the most part. That's good. Well, it's beautiful wherever you are. Unless that's a background. I don't know. I'm assuming. Is that a background? This is my reel, so that's my little balcony. There you go. Got it. But it looks very beautiful. The window that I can see outside of. Yes. Getting the real New York City. Not very big, you can see. There you go. Mark will know that. Mark is our New Yorker on the team. Yeah, but Mark's in the Hampton, so I'm feeling sorry right now. Back together? Yeah. Go ahead. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Well, so we spent some time together about a week ago, and it was short. It was 10 or 15 minutes. So thank you so much for that time. And I also appreciate you taking a full hour today to chat with us, because I know that's a lot of time out of your schedule. We have Mark and we have Howard, who you met before, and drew with us today. One of our co founders, Vinod, is not with us. He's our chief technology officer. But we brought this team together just to chat with you. And we'd love to tell you more about what InnVestAI is doing, but I thought, given the conversation last week, maybe it would be best to start out with, well, first for everyone. You and I met through a collective friend of ours, Carol. Hansel. Hansel. Who? I've used Carol on many assignments, and actually, Mark knows Carol as well. And Jessica, you and Carol are friends, and I believe you said you're on Carol's financial advisory committee, if I recall that. Yeah, her exact. Her advisory board. For Dragonfly. For Dragonfly. I'm a huge fan of Carol. All the work she's done for me has been incredible. And I had reached out to her about six weeks ago to talk about potential partnerships between InnVestAI and Dragonfly. Because I believe there could be opportunity to explore, especially on the revenue side, how to better underwrite hotels. We do it at a fairly high level. Even at. Even at the deepest level of underwriting, we still do it at a fairly high level. But when technology starts to kick in and we can automate data more, we'll be able to dive into more, I think, detail. And that's why I had reached out to Carol. Carol said, I need to connect to a Jessica. Just because a great friend of mine, you'll really love getting to know her. And so that was the impetus of this. And now we're just chatting to get to know you. Because I believe Carol thinks. I mean, that you would be a wonderful friend for us in the future, however that may be. You're very well connected. And it may also lead to something on the scholarshi side. Maybe yes, maybe no. But we definitely want to make sure that we're connected with you, because you could be a really great resource for us as we grow our company. With that. Go ahead. I'm sorry, what were you going to say? Oh, no, I was just going to say, would it make sense to do then introductions? That's all right. Could we flip it this time? Because I talked almost 10 of the last 15 minutes and I felt like you had so much to share about your background. Would it be okay if you led the introductions and then we'll follow through on the invest side? Yeah, absolutely. I took a little bit of an odd path into technology. I was a big law lawyer at Sherman and Sterling. I went in house to a hotel company called Newport Hotel, group of about 10 hotels. Owned and managed and real estate company. With brothers who are principals, that one of them had been my professor in college at Brown. And the either good or bad fortune, depending on how you look at it, to start with them in September of 2008. So what we imagined would be a real estate acquisitions and in house council job. I mean let's be honest, they didn't really need in house counsel. Kind of came a. Hey, you better figure out a way to justify your salary job. Because this is a very choppy economy. Your entire class at Sherman and Sterling, from fourth years up to the partners, had been let go from the law firm, which had never happened in history. Right. And people, of course, think of that. As a, you know, housing crisis. But those of us, which I think is kind of everyone on this call that we're on the hotel side, know that it was a complete hotel crisis. Right. And so I sort of had to find myself at least another half a job. And I started to take over technology and e commerce. I consolidated all of our kind of technology under Travel Click. Because we had 10 hotels, we were using lots of different small vendors. Some of you remember when Pegasus went dark for three days? And we couldn't book hotel rooms other than writing down, like, this person is here. This is Diane. She's in room 304. Right. So there were a lot of smaller tech companies that were really struggling, and I figured we would be a bigger fish. Travel clicks kind of slogan at the time was a single set of integrated solutions for hotels. They were not integrated. They had just acquired a lot of different companies that sold hotel tech. And so I spent the next year and a half kind of figuring out, how do we make these things work together? How do we make the whole greater than the sum of the parts. At which point Travel Click hired me to run their mid market business and find that their ability to sell right through that middle of other Newport hotel groups. And I took. I stayed at Travel click from the $100 million to $350 million ARR point. We sold the company to Toma Bravo. I stayed for about another year or so. But as we kind of became focused more on profitability than on growth, it was very hard to grow the products because the tech wasn't fundamentally scalable. So I said to myself, I'd really like to go build something. Build out sales and revenue at a company that is a tech company. I went to Alice. I was their first sales leader, 10th employee. We grew that company over four years. I spent the last year and a half in Europe, opening up the European market. We sold the company to Expedia and then now it is part of Actable, which is owned by asg. I went from there. When Alice said you can come back. We're owned by Expedia now. We don't really need you. In Paris anymore. I sort of said, well, I might just find a new job in that case. So I moved from there to a company called 7 Room. Sorry. And if I didn't say Alice is operations platform technology company. Travel Click is now part of Amadeus, which is the largest travel tech company in the world. Seven rooms is a restaurant booking and operations platform. I've already told you guys that I have excellent timing. So I joined seven rooms six weeks before every restaurant in the world stopped operating and booking for almost two years. So that was great. Since I was in charge of revenue, operations and strategy, we pivoted the company Howard delivery. And then I also helped them build a partnership and close a partnership with Capital One. That was like an eight figure, four year deal. And that kind of allowed us to stay afloat when all of our competitors had set. Our product's just going to be free for the next year, at minimum. And then I founded or co founded a company with a hotelier in North Carolina. Back in the hotel operations space similar to Alice. But focused on select service hotels. And then we sold that company to Kipsu. It was a bit of a fiery situation. Let's call it a flip and buy the skinnier teeth kind of situation. Came out on the other side, said to a bunch of friends, hey, I really like doing this go to market stuff for hotels, but I don't really want to be a Chief Revenue officer anywhere that is hiring. I don't really want to be a CEO. I don't think I have the wherewithal. Right now to found something new. And I sort of said, if you need any help at your company, I'm happy to give you some help. That turned into a pretty big business, and I was able to sort of run a consulting and advisory business. But what I really loved was working with the earlier stage founders. They couldn't pay me the Amadeuses. The stay in touches. The larger players had plenty of money and were happy to pay me, essentially. For not very many hours. But I just thought this is really backward for these small companies that could benefit the most from this kind of support. Go to market product, market fit. Executive coaching team, finding people for the team, right? And I'd rather figure out how. Can you attach that to the capital? I met some folks in Silicon Valley called Tekne Infinity Ventures. They own a hotel group, as Diane mentioned, called Shashi. And really, they had a very, very similar vision, which is if you invest in vertical companies, primarily B2B SaaS for hotel technology, restaurant technology, travel technology, and let's call it adjacencies. And then you provide an operating partner that can really bring that expertise. To those, to those tech companies, along with a big ecosystem of advisors and a network that can help jump those companies ahead. That network being partially abridged to Silicon Valley to help with generalist venture, which is often considered investing in hospitality to be a sort of niche. They don't get it. They don't. Understand it. They can understand agribusiness, robotics, AI, but like, hospitality is just very confusing for them. That's a niche industry. So we help form that bridge for them. We help form the actual bridge to Silicon Valley tech so that we're working with our founders. To build best in class tech solutions. And then finally, of course, to the hospitality and travel tech side, because that is also essential and how we help our founders get ahead so that they can test use cases, they can get in front of customers and partners and go straight to the right part of the organization and sort of we help put our hand on the scale. For them, as I like to say. So that's what I do. I have a consulting and advisory business still, and I am an operating partner at TEC H. That's great. Thank you so much. So, again, we are friends through Carol. And I have the highest respect for Carol. I love all the work she's done. And so I consider this a very friendly conversation between folks that I believe we could be on each other's radar screens for a very long time. And we're just getting to know each other. So now pivoting back to us, we are the co founders of a company called InnVestAI and we all come from commercial real estate investing. Three of us on the hospitality side and two of us on the multifamily side. And that's actually a very important differentiator for us. Because this comes very much from. Actually, Drew and I met when I first joined cbre. And Drew will do introductions in a moment. But he had just founded his own asset management tech companies supporting hotel asset management functions. By pooling data up at this point. And Drew will explain all of this himself as well. But he was very impressive to me at CBRE because he had multiple management companies mapped against each other. From our chart of account s, which is a big thing for us, I could see that at cbre we had Benchmarker, which was a PKF product that they had acquired through the acquisition of pkf. But the actual pulling the data together was still done in a very manual, difficult way. And Drew could offer solutions to that. But unfortunately, CBRE just wouldn't let go of that. They were very old school and they're thinking at the time, and it's taken a long time for them to kind of advance in their views on technology. Three of us, Mark, Drew and I come from the hotel acquisitions, investment, asset management side. And then Howard and Vinod come from the multifamily side. At cbre. I came in with, they tasked me with the goal. Of growing a third party asset management business. And I had just walked out of two third party asset management businesses that had tremendous difficulty scaling. They could not get above 60 assignments no matter what. It was just a problem. They hit a wall with scaling. And that has a lot to do with shadow inventory, a lot of other things. But when I came into CBRE, it was like, you're a big company. 60 assignments is nothing to you. You're going to need a way to scale this business much more than a third party asset management business can do. Have you thought about technology? Because we're just not interconnected from a technology business. And I believe you could really scale this business upward of $100 million. ARR. If we just were to really think about the strategically. And as I studied what CBR was doing and others were doing the concept at the time, Is you don't do that in house at cbre. What you do is you turn around and invest in another business, a third party business that is much more entrepreneurial than you are. You invest. At the time, I had proposed investing $4 million into a company called Otellier and helping turn their business from the operating side, pivoting a part of their business onto the real estate side and creating an EVM and pipeline management and all of that. To my heart. I know them quite. I know them quite well. So, yes, Ali. Right. He's an incredibly smart individual, and he's one of Drew's customers. Drew will talk about this, but he's one of his relationships as well. It was to my heartbreak. And I can say this as a new friend, right, that CBR declined to do this. Because hotels were just too small of a property type. But as literally I was leaving. Two weeks from my departure, they announced they were investing 25 million into VTS. And I know you know who VTS is, right? Because we've talked about that, and I've studied BTS at length. Because of calling vts at my co op as we speak. And I'm living in the back end of that software on a daily ish basis right now. Yes. So you probably are seeing a lot of cons. What I saw was at cbre, they did a very in depth analysis of investing in either Costar. Or vts, and they decided on DTS because of the workflow automation. And they did make that investment. And VGS is moving its product into a marketplace as well, which we'll talk about that. That's probably a third part strategy that we have as we launch InnVestAI. But I left CBRE brokenhearted as an investor. I would have made that same investment decision all day long. I know both of the companies inside and out. And in fact, I've done it. Drew, it sounds like you may have done the same. It sounds like you're the data guy. I've done a very, very, very deep dive into the co star data and I wasn't, like, overly impressed with the quality of data nor the approach to how they obtain the data. In comparison to we're living in like a Gen AI world, for example, today. And I can't blame them for not using Gen AI several years ago when I was doing this deep dive. But I know that their methodologies have not really changed. Point being that I definitely see the difference in those two investments, but there's obviously a lot more to the story. Yes, but I was encouraged as I left that I was on the right track. It just wasn't going to be hospitality for cbre. Right. And this is something. And I'm a co founder. You have all our other co founders on the line here. It's something I couldn't let go of. It's just in my heart, I was the one to work 16 hour days because the data is so fragmented and it's so hard to pull all the data together. And you do something and then something changes and you have to redo the entire thing. And Mark will say this. It's like Excel is where Data goes to die, right? Because you just can't pull it out of Excel. And all of us. Howard on the multifamily side. Drew, Mark and I have all lived this ourselves. So we set out. I set out initially and how I got to know. Let me just start this incrementally so you get to know who we are. Mark and I know each other over 20 years. Mark, when he introduces himself, worked for Sonic Goldman and they sold many hotels to lend lease when I was there in acquisitions and asset management. Drew and I got to know each other when I was at cbre, and Drew was networking because he actually could have provided a tremendous benefit to cbre, but they were closed minded about it. And wouldn't consider it. But Drew and I's relationship grew out of my experience at CBRE and his starting his own business at Hotel Biz, which I'll talk about. Howard and I got to know each other because at cbre, I studied and studied and studied and studied this business. And it appeared on the multifamily side that Red IQ was the market leader, avm. And so I set out to understand who were the leaders of Red iq. And it just so happened, the timing that this is crazy small world. But some hotel brokers that had worked for Cushman and Wakefield, who actually had worked for Mark when he was at Son and Blicken. Goldman. Right. It's that small of an industry. Joined Berkadia For Kadia owned red iq. And so they made the introduce. They made the introduction to me, to Howard. And Howard and I started to talk because hotels have never had an AVM, but multifamily has been very successful with an ABM, and they actually have probably 7 to 10 at this point. At the time, Red IQ was the leading AVM with, I think, 60% market share, which was a huge percentage of market share, so I wanted to understand how they did it. And Howard and I got to know each other. And then fast forward another year and Berkadia sold Red IQ to a company called Radix. Some things happened with Radix and Howard became available to market. And that's when Howard and I decided to partner on this. And then within very quick succession of this. Drew came in because he has the data background on hospitality. And Mark came in because he is the capital market's face of our company. He is a deal guy. He is a broker. He is Bob. He's an equivalent of Bob Webster. Right. So now you can see kind of why we all make sense together. Let me make sure I know, because this side of the business, I know a little less. Well, like, when we're talking abm, are we talking, like, a yardy? Or even, like, if you go old school, like a BJ Murray, like, what? What? What is coming? What? So it is the idea of, you know, hvs. Right? Everyone knows HVs. And back in the, I don't know, late 80s, early 90s, they set the industry standard for how you value a hotel. Okay, Everyone has a version of that original HVS model. Where we really have not moved off of that in four years. Everyone has their own version of how they've recreated it in Excel. But it is. Essentially, you go through. You pull in all the traumaclick data, right? Well, it's the CoStar data, it's the star data. You build a market segmentation. You project out five years, then you project out your expenses, then you project out your noi, then you do your cap rate and. Your exit cap, right? And you come up with an ir, all your valuation and underwriting. All your valuation underwriting, all the things that brokers do, investors do, lenders do. And the crazy thing is, Jessica, is that they all do the same workflow. Over and over and over and over again with the same data. It is the. It's just a ridiculous amount. Of redundancy. Redundancy that happens in these manual formats that just kill data and they kill time and they kill inspiration. And so Howard brought into our company, and I really will give it up to everyone in a moment to explain this. But he built an AVM for multifamily, right? And we wanted to build that for hospitality. We knew how to underwrite hospitality. We did not know how to build an avm. Howard did. Drew knows data, hotel data, up down, inside out. There's nothing Drew doesn't know about hotel data. And he has these incredible relationships with management companies. And hotelier. And actable. Mark knows deals like deals inside and out. He is the face of capital markets, and he's been a tech investor and believes in tech investing. And why I have to call that out is I worked very closely with Bob Webster, and I talked to Bob Webster when I was at CBRE for almost two years about this. Bob could see it. He could visualize it. But in his mind, he was never going to get there. The difference between Bob and Mark is that Mark can get there. Mark knows in his mind how to get there, and he'll explain that in a moment. And then the last person that's not here is Vinod and Benodin Howard worked together. Red iq. The nodes are chief technology Officer. And he is the one that is leading the actual. Now we're in the MVP mode. We have three offshore software engineers who are building out the POC were a fourth of the way through. That's so encouraging to see. I'm glad I was as naive as I was going into this, because if I had really understood what Howard and Pinot bring to the table, I think I would have been a lot more afraid of tackling this. But I'm blessed. We're all blessed to have them. And we're doing it. We're by mid September we will have a full MVP of a pipeline management like deal path and an AVM software. And we believe this is the very root beginning of changing capital markets for hotels. So I know that was a big lead in, but what I would love to do is now turn over. You've already talked to Howard, so I would really love to turn it to Mark next. Because Mark really knows capital markets. And again, I couldn't do this without any of these partners. And Mark's knowledge of capital markets is well beyond my own. So start with Mark. Mark, do you mind just introducing yourself? No, not at all. Hi, I'm Mark. Yes. So as Diane said, I've been in the hotel world for 30 something years. And I've done a lot of different things during that period. I spent 20 years as a hotel advisor. I was a partner or the hotel partner in Sonbla Goldman, which was a real estate investment banking business. We sold our company. To Kushman to Wakefield in 2007. And then I ran Cushman's hotel business nationally for four years as part of that integration. And then developed a number of large hotels in New York City. For a period of about eight years and since then have been just investing. In hotel companies and hotels and in hotel tech. So given that I've done all of these things, when Diane called to really pitch this idea to me, it resonated with me in about 30 seconds, just knowing what it's like to work with analysts, associates, VPs, coordinating the process, going through the deal process. It's just an incredibly time consuming and inefficient way to do deals. And really nothing evolved since the 90s when I got into the industry. Everyone is pretty much doing the things the same way they were back then. Everyone kind of intuitively knows that there needs to be a better way. But no one really knows how to get there. The industry has always been decades behind in terms of technology integration and implementation. And now, with the advent of data analytics and AI, it really feels like it's the time to tie all that together. And create one uniform system to really run the hotel process. Everything from inception of looking at an acquisition to ultimately selling a hotel. In one kind of need and convenient and efficient way. That's why I'm here. I get it. I totally see it. And yeah, I'd love to even talk to you more broadly off this call about the other tech you're invested in, what you're seeing as other needs, etc. Obviously we can focus on what you guys are doing at InnVestAI today. But we founded a vertical fund for hospitality because we were sort of. We were sort of focused on we have to. To build these companies if they're not going to sort of get built from the industry. Right. Because I think we saw the same thing that you're seeing and that it takes, it's going to take a village to transform the technology and bring the right people together to do that transformation. And I think what you guys are doing? Is really, really interesting and a big gap. I think a lot of what we've been focused on or the companies that come to us are solving on the operations, guest management, marketing, all of the once the hotel exists and has been purchased side. So I'm really interested to see more of what you're doing. But I have also observed the need. I completely see it. I think it's a pretty easy go to market once if you get any of the big three or any of the most major brokerages to just test it and try it, easy. Build from there. It's really not just brokerages. In many ways, the lending community could benefit greatly from this platform. The asset management community. There's just owners, brokers. There's probably a half a dozen distinct user types. That we think would really embrace this. The market's bigger than the brokers, but just from a go to market immediate scale. If you put it in any of those big players, I think you can very quickly get a lot of usage and some pretty big contracts. And essentially get to profitability very, very quickly. Lots of different applications. And then the other part of this is really just having a team as diverse as ours. We've got great tech, tech people, but also in the hotel industry. It's sort of a very incestuous little club, and unless you're in it, you can have the best technology possible, but if you don't have relationships with the users. Just convincing them to give it a try is probably three quarters of the battle. So the fact that Drew and Diane and I have been in the industry for as long as we have and have so many relationships. I think that'll make our launch that much more efficient and that much more expedient. Just because we could call and call people that we've known for decades and ask them to give it a try. And we've had a lot of those calls initially, and the feedback has been great. This is kind of exactly what we're looking for. And let us know when you're ready. So I think the launch is going to be very efficient and successful just because of the deep standing relationships. Y eah, absolutely. And then let me flip it. Let's all flip it over to Drew. I can't say enough about Drew. Like, how he understands hotel data. He's like this bridge that exists between Mark and I really sit on the business side. Howard and Benod sit on the technology side, and Drew plays this really critical role in between because he's technical enough to speak Vinod and Howard's language, but he understands the business side and not to speak Mark and my language. And so Drew is like a critical mid. He binds us all together with his knowledge of data. So, I'm sorry, Drew. I'm going to give you your props, but please, go ahead and chat about yourself. Thank you for that. Yeah, I'm sure, Wallace. And my background is also all in hospitality. My dad's in hospitality as well. Actually. So I really grew up in the business. Like a lot of people. They've got to end up falling into it. That's how I did. And I worked for IHG on the corporate side doing spna. And Alice might work. And then I went to Davidson. She's a third party operator. Also in the corporate side doing like, asset management and acquisitions type work. And then I was at an ownership group, private equity fund again doing the asset management. And through all of these roles, I used a lot of different systems and tools. And always kind of was trying to improve processes, be more efficient. With how people use analyze data. And when I was on the ownership side, there just really wasn't anything to do. No tools or no systems work done. So I started working with a technology company. That I thought could help build something from scratch. And then 2020 happened, and I went on my own and decided to do this full time. So I still work with the same company. It's been five years now. We work with. Start with Capital, Clint Properties, a bunch of other real estate investors. As I said, we aggregate data from all sorts of different sources. STR or travel click 40 to 50 different hotel operators at this point. And we are continuing to grow our data set. Basically, the goal is that if you're an asset manager, Even an above property person and say, an operator. Or brand that dealing with multiple different hotels where you're usually pulling data sources and copying it into Excel, that you can stop doing all of that and use our system to just fully automate the consumption, utilization of data. After I've been talking with Diane. Three, four years ago and three. And then Portman took the conversation going. As our company grew. And then when she came after connecting with Howard and sort of putting this group together, seemed like a very good fit, because my company, until the ISS on the asset management side, this company is going to do the acquisition side. Is. On the one hand, they're distinct and separate things. But on the other hand, they're very related. And so it was, fortunately, it was a very good compliment in the way that our system is designed and the way that this technology back is being designed. So beyond just acquisitions. One of the key things that public companies have to do in real estate. Is do quarterly evaluations of their entire. So if you're a public company and you look 50 hotels every quarter, you have to go through an entirely new underwriting process for every property to come up with the current value so they can report that to the street. Basically re underwriting your entire portfolio every quarter. And that's something that, even though it's not an acquisitions. It uses the same data that Hotel Bis already has. But it can be put into InnVestAI and used again to do underwriting, and they automate that process. Same with refinancing. Dismissions, right? Even though it's not an acquisition per se, it's going through the underwriting process. Very broad applicability for this underwriting AVM tool. And leveraging data that exists in our system already. And what is the nature of the data? It's financial and statistical data. So it's everything you get in a P and L. All your very granular PNL data down to linear cost in the rooms, department or hours worked for housekeepers. Actual budget forecasts pro formas. So all that data pulled together into a standardized format. So you're probably familiar with vsali. So all the operators. Use you Sally and put their like make their PNL and their chart of accounts use Sally based. But there's still a lot of variances. So we blend it all together into a standard chart of accounts. So whether you have brand manager sells by Marad, Healthy or Hyatt or third party with Ambridge or HEI or Davidson, like all that data is visible at a very side by side manner. Right? It's all standardized. We do all of that for our customers so that they can just pull up their PNLs or their KPI reports, their dashboards, whatever, this is what they want. To view it all together. So you can see that without Drew, right? Drew is like this linchpin because he knows the hotel data, and he can be as hot. He can pull in the star data. We can be as high as we want or we can be as granular as we want, right? And that is really, I mean, just it's an amazing thing to be able to add to our team. And Drew, in your opinion, is the data. That is needed. Does it exist already, or do you see gaps in actual. Are there. Are there other data sources that need to be either built or kind of pulled in in different ways? There's always your data sources that could be. That could be utilized or leveraged in this process. But right now, like where we are starting from, people are using, are not using any of that. Right? And they're doing things in Excel, in very manual, repetitive or redundant processes. So anything is going to be a huge step up. And if you start just using the existing data that's already, you know, used in the process, which is like market forecast data, STR benchmark data, and then financial data. So just using that as the basis. But improving the way that data is collected and utilized. Is a huge advantage over what's being done right now. And then if you start to add an additional data sources like booking data. Labor data, macroeconomic data. It all helps the process. Because even though underwriting and asset management are distinct from operating a hotel, it's all the same. It's all the same data. So people are looking at the same things, but perhaps in a different way or to a different level of granularity. Yeah. I mean, I'm asking for a somewhat selfish reason, which is that the data problem exists enormously on the vendor side as well. Right. So when you sell into hotels, it's incredibly difficult to get to get usable data in terms of key decision makers, how to contact people. Even the hierarchies. Who's the asset manager? Who's the ownership group? Who's the brand? Right. How are all these hotels related? This hotel, sold to that hotel. Right. It's all very fragmented. And doing this for five years, that's been one of, I guess the biggest advantages or things that we've gained is we work with 50 plus operators, dozens of ownership groups, travel click str. We've talked, we've been talking with Medallia and Renee, along with other companies. The goal, again, to bring it all into one place. But I guess the technology part of it isn't necessarily the hardest part. Is. I guess getting approval or getting permission to get data is as hard as figuring out what to do with it once you get it. In our industry, which is, I think, just due to our fragmented nature and kind of small. We're very small industry compared to the other asset classes. And so that's a good segue into maybe. Then I'm going to pull Howard in. But one thing before that is, as we set out to do this, Mark was a particularly strong advocate in saying, what if we're going to go after new users, we can't introduce a whole new way of underwriting. It has to be a way that's very familiar to them, because if they have to pick up a tool and say, I've never underwritten a hotel like this, we're not even going to be able to get them into beta test. So we set out purposely to build software that felt almost exactly like you were underwriting in Excel. The same workflows you do, your market penetration, you pull in your pors and your pars and all of that. So much to the fact that we gave a demo to an industry friend of ours, and she said, well, this is exactly what we do in Excel. And that was the point is we wanted to make sure that it felt almost exactly like it does in Excel, so that there would be a sense of already understanding how the process worked, and that was great because Mark really pushed that very hard. And we feel proud that we produced a POC and an mvp. That isn't going to take a huge learning curve for underwriters to use. But that's now where Howard comes in. And it's the first time the three of us on the hotel side have worked with a product manager. And this has been fascinating because we could never have done this without a product manager. I mean, watching what happens, we give Howard our Excel models. And then Howard turns it into database format. And then from there, it gets turned into software. And we would not have known how to do that because we've never done that in hospitality. So with that. I know you talked to Howard last week, but Howards are cheap. Product officer. And again on the multifamily side, he's as experienced in multifamily. As the three of us are in hospitality. But what he brings is great technical knowledge and product management experience, which we don't have. And he adds that, plus he brought Vinodin as our chief technology officer and they'd work together at Berkadia So, Howard, do you mind just reintroducing yourself? I know we talked last week, but just a little bit about you and your experience with Red iq.

### You (2025-08-14T21:47:46.124Z)

Sure. That's good. Good to see you again. Yes, as Diane mentioned, been in the commercial real estate space for over 30 years. But the last half of them on the tech side. But prior to moving into the technical side, I was with some very large multifamily owners and operators. Did a lot of underwriting in Excel and the multifamily space, so I was very, very familiar with the process. I mean, not a whole lot of difference between the two. I think on the multifamily side, you have to deal with rent rolls. You don't have rent rolls in the hospitality. Financial statements, etc. But early in my career, I learned that I'm really more of a numbers guy and a tech enthusiast. I was always one of the first to try something new. And had an opportunity to join RealPage and help them build their very first consolidated central reporting was in the name of the product. But Real Pages business model is growth through acquisition. So very few products are organic. And so it's like constantly trying to get those square pegs in the round hole. And once I started working for them, I was bit by the tech bug, so it's been on the technical side, the vendor side, ever since. And without going through all of the other history of the companies I was with, we'll talk about Red iq. And I do have to point out and clarify that I didn't build redIQ, I just made it a whole lot better. Yeah, Red IQ did have the vast market share in the multifamily underwriting space. And we count Walker and Dunlop. Cbre jll a lot of the major brokerages do use Red iq. And I think the reason why and the reason why Berkadia purchased Red IQ is because we had built a pretty robust document processing system. So financial statements and rent rolls would be uploaded, drag and drop. We'd extract the data. And be able to map everything into kind of a central database and a common format. So our clients would work with the sellers, and they would have to take whatever format the rent roll and operating statement was, whatever system the seller used. And so we were dealing with Yardi, MRI and Trata, Real page. I mean, all of these different processes. And then we'd upload the data and centralize it. And so Berkadia did purchase red IQ back around 20, I think it was 2,017. It was about seven years. When I was there. And they wanted it primarily for their own internal teams and for broker valuation purposes. But we used to joke that it was the worst kept secret in the industry, that Mercadi owned it because we still had JLL and all of the large brokerage companies as clients. They would still use it even though Berkadia owned it. Fast forward. Diane did mention that we were sold then to Radix pretty much almost exactly a year ago. And Radix. We were very excited about the opportunity because one thing that we had a huge gap in red IQ was third party data. And the reason for that is Berkadia had contracts with CoStar, Trepp, and all of these third party data sources, but they prohibited Red IQ from accessing it because they viewed Red IQ as a reseller and that we would get that. Radix had their own multifamily database, and so we were anticipating big things with the acquisition that we would find they'd be able to take our user base. Along with some third party data, get a real robust system. But it didn't work out that way. It was a great idea, but bad timing. Radix was caught up indirectly with the class action suit that RealPage had. Their core product was suffering badly, so they basically took all of the engineers, all of the people. Pulled them off of Red iq, put them onto their core product. In an attempt to salvage, they did a complete pivot. Looking back on it, It was a really bad decision. Something. They just got bad advice. And so essentially, they made the decision in January to only keep two engineers, to basically keep the lights on with red iq and everybody else was let go. So, as Diane mentioned, she and I had talked back, and when we were with the Berkadia and they brought him to hospitality team, And she was extremely excited about the possibility. But at the time I was realizing Red IQ was strictly multifamily. We were looking to branch out into other asset types, but kept getting pushed back from Berkadia They didn't want to invest the money in it. It would be making some major changes to the Red IQ business model. And so it just never really transpired. But obviously, after Radix did make made their changes, Diane called me again. We were talking, and I was still skeptical, I have to tell you, because I'm used to all of these different real estate asset classes having AVM models. And all this data out there. And when she kept telling me, well, there's nothing like it in hotel. I was kind of took it with a grain of salt. But this time she said it and I thought, all right, I've got plenty of time on my hands. I'm going to look into it. And sure enough, I could not find anything like this in the hospitality space. And I was just like, why? I don't understand it. So I think the writing was on the wall that we're going to do it. We're going to make it. We're going to make it happen. As soon as I started working with Diane and started to get some of those Excel models and taking a look at it, One of the things I noticed is that there really is a lot of standardization in hospitality. The financial statements, the way that they're laid out was way different than what I was used to in multifamily. In multifamily. The only standardization is income is on the top, expenses on the bottom. But other than that, it could be any type of combination. So I do think that this is a great opportunity to build a very strong vertical within the very niche market. A huge market financially. There's a lot of money in the hotel space. And I think that there's a lot more to it than just speeding up the underwriting. I mean, that's going to be our foot in the door. But I've mentioned many times the data that we will be generating. Is unique in that most of the data out there is looking in arrears. It's their historical financial statements that they upload at the end of the month. I'm looking backward, but we're going to have investors and we're going to have users who are underwriting deals. Looking forward. And so we'll know the hot market s We'll know what are the cap rates, what property types are hot. We can take a look at all of that. And as part of our business plan, we will be aggregating and anonymizing that data that we get from them so that we can start getting some very robust forward looking metrics as well. So I think that's going to be a huge opportunity for us as well.

### Guest (2025-08-14T21:56:37.104Z)

Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That's very interesting. I mean, I was at, you know, Travel Click as We built out Demand360, and, you know, when we. When we took in, you know, or purchased hotel agents and then rolled it into the business intelligence suite. So definitely see the value of building out the forward looking demand stuff.

### You (2025-08-14T21:57:04.604Z)

Yeah. We've also looked at. I've been doing a lot of experimentation with the different AI tools out there, and in addition to the data that our users are providing, it's getting so much easier. In fact, I did a proof of concept that I circulated with the team where I picked out a hotel that I used to stay at in Costa Mesa, when I was out in the office out there, and I just put in a little bit of a description, gave it a little bit of instructions. And I ended up getting a very accurate historical look at that particular hotel. I got tax information, I got previous owner history and all sorts of stuff that anytime a user is working on a deal, not just the information that they have, but we'll be able to pull in all this other data from other we've got some partners that we've been speaking to as well as getting some of that public information. Aggregating it. And really, the idea is to give cradle to grave. Tool that a person that the team can use.

### Guest (2025-08-14T21:58:12.624Z)

I mean, I think. Building out a data set that's fundamentally gen AI based is like an absolute necessity. Today and the only way you're going to build a sustainable company and that the other data sources that you're pulling from are going to suffer from having to rebuild their tech stack and that that's going to have.

### You (2025-08-14T21:58:40.284Z)

Yeah. Well, I learned that lesson the hard way. And I speak in past tense of red IQ because about the last year before we got sold to Radix, we did get leapfrogged by a couple of competitors out there, aren't sure, and a couple other ones. That did jump on that AI Bandwagon very early. And so we were still manually uploading these operating statements, financial statements, but it was all rules based. And if a user took an Excel spreadsheet and changed the name of a column. It would get kicked out. Right. And meanwhile, our competitors are processing anything because of AI. And so definitely learned a while ago that, yeah, you can't be stuck in old rules. Engine. And expect to keep up with what's going on with AI.

### Guest (2025-08-14T21:59:38.384Z)

Yeah, absolutely. So I know we're at the top of the hour, but that's the group. And this is a B2B business because we're selling. We're this not a consumer. We're selling to other businesses. It is Automation of pipeline management and abm. But then we also look at other workflows like legal is you're an attorney by background, right? And what is happening in the legal space is amazing right now from a AI perspective. What's happening in the capex space with Procore and renovations and other digital twin Howard and I were just talking about. That this morning. So we see lots of opportunity. That's like the workflow automation. The second part is data and how we essentially build value around the data aggregation, anonymization of data that's never really been anonymized and aggregated. And then the third is taking a play from that VTS playbook. How do you become a market? How do you become the marketplace where hotels transact on this platform? In three plus years. And I can tell you firsthand because I read everything CBRE wrote about this. That's exactly what they viewed would happen in the occupier and real estate space. So we're playing right into that, and we're just doing it for our niche industry hotels. And I guess we're going to end this with. We're doing this because this is going to be built by hotel investors. For hotel investors. We know hotels, right? And no other property type is going to come do this for hotels. We're just too small for them to care about. But we are big enough that I truly believe we can get to. Over a 5, 7, 10 year period to 100 million ARR. When you start to look at how you build out these workflows, that will just automatically start to come, like how does legal follow avm, how does capex follow the data? And then ultimately some sort of the industry itself. If you look at how much hotel brokers both equity and debt. How much hotel owners make from acquisition and asset management fees appraisers make. It's a two billion dollar fee industry. Two billion dollars. And it has no automation, no digitalization, no AI at this point whatsoever. And that's what we're set out to solve. Really what we're set out to solve is making our peers lives much better because we sat in their shoes, right? And we know the pain points. And we want to be able to help. We don't want people to work. 18 hour days and barely be able to keep up with their work. And we want to really help the hotel industry. Improve the way they do things. Our caps are set on that and we're going to do it. We believe it. Yeah, absolutely. I love hearing about it. I mean, I think this is the question I asked you at the end of our last call, and I'll ask you again. What can I do to be helpful? What do you need? I think that's really kind of what it comes down to. I think what you guys are doing is very interesting. I think there's a lot of merit to what you're building. I would certainly be interested in getting involved in some capacity, and I can think of other people who would probably be pretty interested. In what you're doing. Although obviously you guys are pretty stellar team that's quite well networked yourself. But it's always cumulative. And it's cumulative. We're well networked, but we're not that well networked, right? And so I guess to answer that question, The first thing is I'm going to go back to my relationship with Carol, right in that friends make a big difference in this industry. And so you are incredibly well connected and have deep experience in the space. So just by being on your network, there is benefit to us. We are going to be networking with a lot of data sources. We're going to be reaching out to travelclick. We're going to be reaching out to a lot of the lighthouses and the duetos and trying to figure that out. We're going to be reaching out to other procores and we're going to be reaching out to Berends as well, because part of this is very brand driven. Right? That's one thing that makes our industry unique, is how the brand dictates so much of what we do. We are also beginning, starting in September, our pre seed raise. It's probably a friends and family raise when it's all said and done. As we look at this, over a 2 1/2 to 3 year period, we may be looking at 4 million, but we're not going to do that all at once. So we're going to look for our friends and family raise at first. With maybe 4, 8, 10 people writing some small checks. That understand the value of this. And that gets us working capital to get to then a more formal precede angel raise. Right? I mean, to be honest. Yes, absolutely. And we could get into another conversation, like kind of the ways I think this is set up to be venture investable and the ways it's not set up to be venture investable. But I also think there's going to be just a lot of very interested capital in the market. I think people like Art Adler and Bob Webster and real estate ownership, like my former employers at Newport Hotel Group, Doug and John Cohen. I can see you guys really writing these checks off of some of the asset manager s. And industry, etc. And then you're not captive to the kind of PACE and 10xing obligations that venture capital will give you. If I were advising you, if you were to bring me on as an advisor or consultant or independent board member. I would look at your options and what they're going to be like, because given the experience of your team, there's not going to be that much benefit from capital that's going to be able to help jump you ahead, unless it's a very specific situation. Techne is an example of that. I really don't think generalist VC is really going to be able to do that much for you, short of like, I don't know, recommend someone to be your CFO at some point or something. That's so funny. We are actually talking about that, that that's one of the roles that we're missing right now, but yes. I do think. And I'm just going to give you this caveat. Take it for what it's worth, like. And I don't know how you've constituted the company, how you guys are paying yourselves or not. You are going to get immediate pushback on what is the burn of having this senior A team right now at this early stage of company. Prior to even having an mvp that will cause pushback. Well, I'll tell you right out the burn is we've all been working for free for it's gonna for nine months, right? And we've done that on our own account. It's the time that we put in this. We don't expect to get that recouped. At some point, we will need to start to pay ourselves something that is livable. Livable wage. But we don't expect to earn salaries that are commensurate with. I worked with Buried Loom from Xenia. He was one of my biggest mentors. And I know he makes a fortune, right? We're going to be making peanuts compared to that. But we will need to start to be able to draw on some kind of living wage. But what we have, though, is the ability to run without a lot of additional staffing for a fairly long time. We're going to need a fractional cfo. We're going to need some more people on AI. But it's going to be a build by partner. Right? We're going to really be looking at the build by partner strategy because there's going to be a lot of partnerships that we enter into. To be able to execute well on AI. So our hiring over the next 12 to 18 months probably will be a lot less than another company that would be commensur with our does that make sense? Because we already have Mark and I can do the sales ourselves. So I don't think we will handle the sales. We probably will need additional software engineering and some help with AI and AI partnerships to do a really good job of this. Drew's got the data covered. And then we think we'll probably need someone on marketing. And we may want someone to come in and help build out maybe an adjacent consulting business. But we're really in the early stages of even talking about that. It would not help the technology company. But we think it could help the relationships as we try to become the AI solution. For the hotel investment industry, so I don't know if I answered that well, but that's how we see it. I think you need to financially model it out, and you need to put it in front of a few people who do venture investing and then really think through. What capital sources are available under this financial model, right? I think you want to understand how quickly could you get to profitability? Like, how many customers would you need to get from MVP to profitability? Like, what is the. What even does. We didn't talk at all about your pricing model. Right. And I think you're going to need to look at that. Versus what could you do if you had a lot of additional capital to scale more quickly? And you're going to need to understand with our current resources, what does the burn on livable wages look like and that kind of thing, you may want to do a larger precede than you think so that you can live for longer on that livable wage. In that kind of lean but extremely senior team. Model, but I think there's a lot to think about there, and that's probably a really important area for you guys to concentrate on and focus in on in the near term and get the right support around, because I think that's going to be really, really core to getting to the other side of just being able to scale profitability. Right, all of that. Yes. One thing. I'm just going to put this out there because we haven't formalized just this yet, but we are thinking about this. Which is we really would like almost two advisory committees for us, the way we think about it. One is a senior advisory committee. And I could see, like we were talking about you being a member of something like this. But we're also looking for, like, the Bob Websters, right? And the Mitchaws or the Steve. Angels or the Ellen Browns. We have people in mind, right? They're peers of ours. But trying to put CARLOS RODRIGUEZ jr. As one, trying to put a group of senior people together that can help advise us on how best to execute our business. Then we also want a group of junior people to advise us on how to execute the business. So this would be analysts. People actually using our product. That can be. Advocates for us can be evangelists. Frost. Right. With their peers. And we. That's. We take that as seriously as we do the senior committee, because we will be selling quite a lot to the end. The CEO is not going to be the one underwriting a hotel, right? That is going to be the analyst or the associate or the VP of Acquisitions or the VP of Asset Management. And so we put as much we're putting as much focus and care into how we build that group of advisors as we are the senior. But one thing I could see is you have a sense of business within technology that I don't think we have met yet. And so that may be another area where we could really find a way to work together. Yeah, absolutely. And I'm very open to chatting with you about that. I would say to me, when I think about the junior people, I think about building a community, like you said, of raving fans. And how can you either get the software in their hands for free so that they're going to their bosses and saying, hey, I got six months of this free tool and I've been doing my underwriting in it. I built it out to look exactly like our underwriting, right? We should be buying full or which is like a very community led growth. Like, you'll see these products that have engineering lead growth right where you just sort of like pop text messaging into your tool, between the customer and the tool and the engineer just kind of puts it in and pretty soon you're spending a million dollars a year with Twilio. Right. So I think there's a community led growth strategy, like you said, of how do you create Raving fans. There's a different strategy, I think, know, bringing in some advisors that you give a small amount of equity to for sort of access to their time. And I think all of those are different than really, rather than even say a senior advisory committee, I would probably use the word board. Which is the people who are most committed to what you are doing with maybe a couple independent people in the beginning, before you fundraise, you may say, hey, we want to put some people on our first board, but those are people where you are reporting out results. They are guiding the business. They have built businesses before. They understand this world. Some piece of it, whatever it is, right? If you don't have a cfo, there's someone who's been a CFO at a tech company that's grown from early stage to call it 20 million or something on your board, right? So you start to sort of assemble a mastermind, which is. Very different than. Advise row a few points of equity at and talk to once a month or once every three months. And so just thank you for taking the time to chat with us. We're at the point right now where we. In a month, we will be at a demo position where we can demo. Actually demo the mvp. We have demoed the poc to our friends. But we feel we need a more. I mean, we feel really good about our plc, and we feel really good about where we are with the mvp, but we want to make sure that our product is polished. The MVP is polished. When we take it out to folks like. To folks like Sashi or others. Because we want to put our best foot forward there. And who knows, they may be a VC investor that isn't right for us. Now, they may be friends and family, source of capital that we had never even considered. They could be nothing. Right? And it could just be a relationship with Jessica. So we feel that by Labor Day or by mid September, we're going to have that MVP in a position where we have a good, strong demo. And then we really do have customers already talking to us. We really feel a good way to enter this might be the debt and structured finance space. Because they underwrite at a high level, they have high volumes, and 30% of hotel loans will come due in 2026, according to Peachtree Hotel Group. So there are already two or three of the leading lenders in the space that could be real clients for us. I would try to secure some sort of design partner relationship with a couple of the different Personas. That you see as the most valuable, immediate next place. So if it's debt and structured finance, one person in that area. If it's brokerage, I don't mean person, I mean companies where we have a commit. You have a committed working relationship, you're giving them software that makes their life easier, usually. For free for the time of that design partnership. Right? And you can design that out. I can even help direct you to some folks who can draft up easy legal around design partnerships. But where you're really working very deeply with them, understanding what would you be doing in an Excel world or with the tools that you use. And what are you doing with us? And where are you getting stuck? That requires some people who see the potential, are a little cutting edge, and can really then give you the feedback and are willing to. I mean, I would see that as your best immediate next step. I've seen design partnerships where people pay something, but I haven't found them to be the best working design partnerships. I think to the extent you have hard expenses that aren't people, expenses that result, it's very reasonable. I think that is what I would focus on is one or two or three design partners fitting different Personas that you think are very, very key. First, go to market. Places to go and really getting them in the software, using it, not taking a look and being like, well, this is so cool, not giving a little bit of advice, right? But really, hey, we're gonna work together for the next six months to get this software. And essentially what that gives you, partner, whatever. Peach Tree Asset Management. Team or whatever is the ability to essentially customize the software to your needs. Now, Howard job is to make sure that all of that customization is actually generally applicable and not just like, I love a button on the right instead of on the left. Right. He has to then go out and vet that against other people that maybe would become beta customers. And how much is this universal? Because one thing that is a little weird about this area is because people are doing it so differently, because they're mostly doing it in Excel. You have to build a very flexible product that can sort of allow for people to replicate their approach, but also you hopefully start to guide the approach over time. Yes. All right. Called you guys hostage a little bit longer. I do have no, this was wonderful. Thank you. And so we would love to maybe as a next step, After Labor Day, mid September. We'll circle back. We'd love to show you our demo when we're there. Have a follow up conversation. You may know folks that you recommend off the bat for us to talk to about our friends and family raise. You may have thoughts for us on our structure. I mean, I just think I'll just close this as Carol is a friend of mine, Carol is a friend of Marx and I really think we could be really good friends and very helpful colleagues to each other in this space, and so we really appreciate the time to get in front of you. Absolutely. Thank you so much. It's great to spend some time with the team and. Yeah. Really excited about what you're building. I think there's huge potential. Thank you. Thanks, jessica.

### You (2025-08-14T22:22:55.164Z)

Yeah. Thank you very much.

### Guest (2025-08-14T22:22:56.464Z)

Have a great even.
