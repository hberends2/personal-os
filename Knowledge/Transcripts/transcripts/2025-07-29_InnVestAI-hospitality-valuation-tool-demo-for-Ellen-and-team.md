Howard puts on a collared shirt.

### You (2025-07-29T18:00:52.742Z)

Hey. You know that we're meeting with a very

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:00:53.619Z)

For these type of discussions.

### You (2025-07-29T18:00:56.482Z)

and special guest when I got a collared shirt on. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:01:03.199Z)

Rolling out the fancy wardrobe.

### You (2025-07-29T18:01:03.892Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:01:05.539Z)

Oh, shoot. I may have actually taken Drew off Hold on. Just He's there on the bottom. My Drew, are you still there? I'm here. Yeah. My video is not working for some reason. Where is Ellen? Hello, Ellen. You're on mute. You're on mute. Oh. Ellen, you're on mute. Everybody somebody has to do it on it. Somebody has Right? Well, you know, we're we're a technology company, so we're we're we're good on mute. At least it wasn't one of you. Exactly. Exactly. Hi, Elton. Again. I know. So good to see you, Diane. It's been so long. My god. I know. Thank you for taking the time to chat with us and, for us to do a quick demo of our product. No. Of course. That'd be great. Thank you. Yeah. So, Ellen, I I think in the interest of time, maybe we'll skip a lot of the introductory stuff and just jump in because I know we wanna be sensitive to your schedule. Okay. So Howard will will lead our discussion and we'll run you through what we've been up to the you know, we'd love to get your feedback

### You (2025-07-29T18:02:12.242Z)

Yeah. So Ellen, nice to meet you. My name is Howard Berends. I am working with our esteemed guests here, Diane, Mark, and Drew, and proud to be able to work with them on a tool that I think is gonna be pretty revolutionary. With, within the hospitality industry. I've been in commercial real estate for over thirty years. First half was on the operational side in multifamily. And then back around 2010, I went to the dark side with technology and vendor relations instead of the owner client, and I've been involved with, what we call a the prop tech.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:03:00.159Z)

Recording in progress.

### You (2025-07-29T18:03:00.452Z)

Industry. Been with RealPage, can service quite a few larger companies. But most recently was with a company called redIQ. And redIQ is one of the industry leading valuation models for multifamily. And we were owned by Berkadia at one time, and then then sold off. So I met Diane while I was at Berkadia, and they had opened recently opened a hospitality office and so Diane knew the principles there. And was discussing the fact that a tool like that doesn't exist in hospitality. And I thought that's kind of strange. It's like every other every other asset type, has a has a valuation model. But, lo and behold, after I did a lot of research, she was absolutely right. So we have been working on a tool, and I know we don't have a whole lot of time here so I'm not gonna get into the minutiae. But I do want you to jump in at any time if you have any questions or comments. Let me share my screen here. That would be a good start.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:04:11.699Z)

And I'm just

### You (2025-07-29T18:04:12.572Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:04:16.459Z)

this this is a proof of concept as well, so keep that in mind. It's it's our scooter version, right, of creating this. And we're in the process of digitizing it right now. But you're seeing the actual Because you're a friend of ours, you're we're we've asked you to see our scooter version. Okay.

### You (2025-07-29T18:04:32.862Z)

Alright. Let me, let me bring up the screen here.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:04:33.899Z)

Yep. Sure. Thank you.

### You (2025-07-29T18:04:42.082Z)

Yeah. I I'm used to Microsoft Teams navigating my way around, Zoom Yes. Yeah. Okay. So does

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:04:57.359Z)

I love Teams too. We're we're Teams.

### You (2025-07-29T18:04:58.812Z)

just to confirm everybody can see the the screen with the InvestAI Welcome to InnVestAI. Correct? Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:00.049Z)

Yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:05.952Z)

Alright. So, Ellen, what we've got here

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:08.669Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:08.892Z)

is what is going to be our core model. Which is for the investment underwriting valuation tool. We will be targeting investors brokers, lenders, mortgage servicers, anybody who in the market who needs to determine evaluation of a hotel asset. And asset managers. Yes. That that's something that they can get.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:34.309Z)

And and asset managers.

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:36.282Z)

This isn't just a one one time use tool. It's something they can use over the entire ownership life cycle. K.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:43.669Z)

We do both.

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:45.672Z)

Yep. Alright. So

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:47.059Z)

We're investors and asset managers. Just just saying.

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:49.852Z)

thing that we're going to have, obviously we're going to have the pipeline where you have a list

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:05:50.499Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-07-29T18:05:53.922Z)

of all of the deals that you're working on. Or invest deals that you have worked on. I've got one here. You know, you could continue to add new properties. I'm not gonna go through the whole process here, but you can see as you keep going, you can keep adding more and more properties to your pipeline. Right? When you wanna work on a deal, you can click on it, but what let me go through the very start. So if I wanted to add a property, I can input the information here. We're gonna be collecting data such as what is the asset type, we're going to have status options, there's going to be a few more options that we put in here that will help you to group and filter and report and use all sorts of different types of slicing and dicing. The next feature, this is one that I that I'm I'm really like. I think it's gonna be really helping the efficiency in terms of I'm going through a valuation process, I don't want to have a tool that has a 100 rows of which I only need 80. Right? So what this will do is this will allow you in the other operating session to pick and choose if you want any of these. And and only what you selected will be shown in the model. As you're going through. Right? And you can just keep it at the high level food and beverage. Or you can drill down and say, you know, I might just have a a quick service tool in there. Right? So that's only will it be displayed in the model. Maybe you don't have any of it. You can just click on that. That's fine. Yeah, Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:07:35.439Z)

If if it's okay for me to add some thoughts Mhmm. One of the areas that we've actually been focused on quite a bit banquets and catering. I just noticed that wasn't included. So I'd probably include that in the drop down

### You (2025-07-29T18:07:49.732Z)

Yeah. We've got room service, bar, lounge,

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:07:51.149Z)

Oh, do you have it? Because it would be under food and beverage. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-29T18:07:53.462Z)

So so yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:07:59.379Z)

You know, it's definitely it's definitely in our

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:01.552Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:02.539Z)

model. I just wanna make sure you didn't lose that because that's that's where the money is right now. No. It definitely it definitely is. I think it just

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:07.052Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And and and this

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:09.489Z)

it just It's a good catch, but it it

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:10.822Z)

actually is a proof of concept that I just kind of would

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:11.789Z)

isn't on this pop up. Oh, that's great.

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:13.362Z)

together. Is definitely not the final product, but but please keep

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:15.369Z)

Sounds good.

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:18.462Z)

you know, giving us these thoughts because

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:20.229Z)

That's great.

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:20.992Z)

you know, we may have something that we have totally overlooked. But the next feature here now this is assuming I'm an investor. Right? I'm gonna get a package from a broker or maybe directly from the seller.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:08:34.769Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-29T18:08:36.402Z)

This is where I can upload financial statements, I can upload an offering memorandum. I can upload an STR report, and all of this will then be used to populate my historic data. That's it. Coming up here your shoot soon. I'll show you then. When you take that historical data, and project forward then for your for your evaluation. So that's that's the primary features of setting up the deal. Once you're done with that, you're gonna be taken to the market data.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:09:03.269Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-29T18:09:06.102Z)

If you've uploaded an STR data, you know, we can we can display the information here, and also you can edit this data if you wanted to add certain other fields that may not be there. You can delete it, etcetera. The same thing is true for operating statistics, so I know a lot of this data is not going to be pre populated by historical reports. I know a lot of the analysts, they'll get on the phone and they'll call. The the competitors or the the other properties in the area. Or other sources of data so they can input the information here. Same thing with with prior transactions. So you can input the property, the year that it sold, the information here, And with both of those operating statistics, operating statistics and the transaction summary, you can continue to add as much data as you want for for that deal. Okay. So so now you've got the deal set up. You've got the historical financial operations. You've got the the the property and marketing information uploaded into the deals. So now you're gonna start getting into the real heart of the product, which is to come up with the valuation. So the next section you can see is where we're gonna have some inputs for our acquisition, financing, equity, and exit assumptions. For the next few sections you're going to see these API cards up at the top. Now, for this proof of concept, this is just hard coded data It wouldn't change. But some of this information down here, you'll see it will change so that every time I change one of my assumptions, it's going to change my data down here. So right now, you know, this has come up with a purchase price based on the information that's uploaded at a 6% cap. I may not agree with that. I may say I'm only going to offer you 159. Instead of $1.60, so I can overwrite that. But I put in my assumptions up here, the 6% cap, acquisition costs, etcetera. On the financing tab, we've got a lot of flexibility here as well, So my loan to value ratio, I can input that. If I change that from 65 to 60, it'll show the the total loan amount down here. We'll will change. You know, I can input the interest rate, etcetera. But this is one of the the best features I think we we came across here when we were developing this is we can we we we've tried to incorporate as much variability into the model so that you're not forced into one way of doing something. So if you're used to doing something one way, we hopefully have that covered in the model. So for example, closing costs, you could just input a general percentage of the loan fee or you can click down here, click on detail, and then you've got this over here where you can go row by row line by line on the closing cost, and then put them there. And whichever you use will input into the the fees and closing costs down below. Equity, this is one that I just I think only a couple people on the call may have seen this, not everybody. But this is this is something very similar. We will have a water on here for partnership expenses. So you can come up with the total equity contribution, which is going to be based on whatever I put in my loan to value here. So I think if I change this back to 65, when I go over here, you can see now I need 35% equity. And then I can put in, you know, what is what is my equity? I'm I'm the investor. What am I putting in? And then what am I put partners putting in? And you can see this only adds up to 70% instead of 65. It's, you know, so it's got a check and balance there, so I can, you know, change this to 45% Also, I can continue to add partners, I can add the, you know, the partner name here. If I have multiple partners, I can continue to add those and input their percentages and then to you know, as long as adds up to 100% of the equity, which would be the 35%, then we're going to be good to go. And then all of all of that will populate the ad equity contributions down here. And then the last one is your exit rate assumptions, which will then populate down here. But notice at all times I've got these KPI cards up here, so anytime I make a change, I can see the effect up here. And, you know, make sure that I'm making assumptions that will match my investment requirements. Pro form a is very detailed, so I'm not gonna get into every section here, but the highlights obviously are that those same cards will be displayed up here but now we also have another section that are geared more towards the operating statistics. And you can see as I scroll here, that's always going to be in view. So you've got your key metrics here with your GOP, your GOP PAR, percentage of revenue, etcetera. You can view your occupancy statistics at any time. So as I go through here and I make changes, you can see 2026 is 77% I may drop that to 75 If I can type right. You can see as I make a change, it's gonna it's make a change live. I don't have to refresh. I don't have click a save button, it's all going to be right there. Revenue, same thing. We've got the other revenue rolled up, but if I wanna see the detail, can just click on that, then I can see the line item detail. And same thing with expenses. So, always trying to keep the important information right in front of you at all times. There will be like I said earlier, we don't wanna have just everybody use the same projection and forecasting method. So there are things that I've put in here. So simple things, like with my occupancy here, my ADR growth, I can just just use a flat growth that's gonna be the same every year. Oh, I didn't mean to tab down. So 2% across here or if I wanna go year by year, be a little bit more, precise, I can do that. And then same thing down here on the expenses. Now this is where you can forecast using the preoccupied room So it's gonna take my historical data that I uploaded there when I input the the property details. And it's going to calculate the cost per occupied room based on the occupancy numbers up here, or I could do it as a percentage of revenue. And this will be based on the total rooms revenue divided by the by the, total excuse me. Yeah. The total rooms expense divided by the total rooms revenue It'll calculate there, so I can go ahead and just continue the the trend if I want to. Again, I typed too fast. 12% is what I was going for. If I can get 123 I'll certainly do that. And then or I could just do a manual input. If I don't want to bother with that. Could just do, you know, 500 and and just put in whatever I want. And that's consistent down through all of the expense rows But what's important is this is because this is a valuation model, we go well below the total expense and a bit below line you know, we can put in our reserve for replacement, if it's 5%, know, we can input that, go through and change it. We get down to the net operating income. Of course, you need that in order to get your valuation, but you can also then go even farther and put in your capital expenditures So if I say, for example, want to include a new roof, and I wanna put that in year two at $350,000. I can do that. We start off with two lines but again, you may have a major CapEx, a major renovation going on. You can just continue to add add in indefinitely. Mhmm. Then you can go down and go there. So very quickly, that's that is the whole pro form a and projection process. Do you have any questions or comments before I go on? We're almost wrapped up here. Okay. Alright. So once we've done all of this evaluation

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:18:01.649Z)

No. That's good if you wanna keep going. I'm just sort of

### You (2025-07-29T18:18:02.722Z)

form a, we get down to our investment summary.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:18:05.199Z)

listening. Awesome.

### You (2025-07-29T18:18:05.752Z)

And so this will show you the breakdown with your year zero acquisition costs, your yearly projections throughout the whole period. And and one thing I didn't mention is in that property details or in excuse me, in the valuation section, was an input for the hold period, so it could be three years, five years, ten years, whatever you input is the number of years that will be displayed for the projection. Scrolling on down here, I don't have any end undistributed expenses in the model right now. That's why it's showing all zeros, but here's your gross operating profit. All the way down, and then you've got your exit assumptions that you put in with the sales proceeds, your debt assumptions, and then finally coming down, you've got your return metrics, your free clear, cash on cash, debt service, debt yield. We're still in the process of evaluating what other metrics we we may wanna include. And again those major cards are going to be shown here. So that's that's really the the meat of the tool. Of course, we will have reports. You know, here's just a sample occupancy report that we can include, but we can have a a large number of reports. There will be a dashboard where the user can see their individual deals or roll up. Going back to the pipeline, you can know, we'll have selection boxes on those deals where if you wanna see a roll up of three properties that might be in the same geographic area, you can do that And then documents. This is another important feature that we that we are incorporating is that we want this to be kind of your one stop do all for asset management, acquisitions, etcetera. So you can upload any related documents into this into this deal. Right? So you could create custom folders. We'll name it you know, custom folder one. And so now we've got custom folders over here. If you prefer grid view as opposed to a table view, it's etcetera. So, you know, being flexible for what works best for you as well as the various ways of evaluating a deal. Is is really the end goal here. So any any questions or comments?

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:20:43.299Z)

I guess I I mean, wow. It's like there's a lot of work that's gone into this. And you know, I guess when I'm looking at this, I like that it's all in one folder, like, of the documents, the sales, the deal is all together. I guess it's you know, it's kind of what we have. And so I'm just trying to figure out what the I'm very sad. Like, if I were Steve Angel and decide whether or not to to buy this for fulcrum, what would what would make us

### You (2025-07-29T18:21:17.382Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:21:17.739Z)

do that, except for the efficiencies. Right? So I think it's really great. I do think there are some things

### You (2025-07-29T18:21:21.512Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:21:22.049Z)

like the waterfall. I assume you're working on putting in a a waterfall for different in you know, investor in preferred and

### You (2025-07-29T18:21:30.122Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:21:31.119Z)

I think on the debt side, I'm assuming you have you know, different parameters on who you know, if you have if you want to look at the different tranches on the debt and and, you know, suffer plus.

### You (2025-07-29T18:21:43.242Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:21:43.719Z)

I think for our investment model, one of the things that we like to include is we toggle a lot with value add. So if we did this, what is the result? If we did that, what is the result? And so and that includes any kind of capital investment to do that, and we'll we'll toggle on and off depending on you know, our partner might be like, you're crazy. We're never gonna do that kind of thing. So I think that those you know, to make it a little and I know this is early, so I'm just saying, you know, please take that with with my acknowledgment that, you know, I think having those kind of I don't wanna say more sophisticated, but more

### You (2025-07-29T18:22:18.942Z)

Yeah. Yeah. The

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:22:20.779Z)

more flexibility, so that that makes it easier for someone who's

### You (2025-07-29T18:22:22.322Z)

that yeah. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:22:24.609Z)

for a group that might not know how to do that. And I think yeah, Yeah.

### You (2025-07-29T18:22:31.962Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:22:32.139Z)

No. No. I was gonna say, I mean, I do like that it's all together in one and it's easily

### You (2025-07-29T18:22:32.612Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:22:35.939Z)

all the documents together. I mean, that is really nice. We have that. Anywhere. Right? Yeah. If I could jump in here giant deal folder. If I could just jump in here for a second on the vision. Right? It's that this is if we were to look at the commercial real estate sector, what we're doing is we're taking a deal path like platform and combining it, embedding an ABM in it. But what our vision is is that we essentially API integrations or agents with essentially all of this data Right? Right. So let's take just, for example, like, real estate tax data. We may, in the future, have an API integration with Ryan or with CBRE. Right? I'm just I'm just grabbing a couple of the bigger providers. Where we're actually able to go in and grab inform from their Yeah. That would be amazing. Yeah. In here. We may be able to right, go grab we're we're thinking about how to create a an API integrate eventually. Right? Not off the bat, but we'll say Procore. And develop a CapEx module that sits on top of Procore so that we're able to pull up all the renovation detail and CapEx detail if this is making sense. Because we're working with Procore on a specific hotel module that sits on top of their their their, GC, right, their GC software platform. So that is, like, the ultimate end goal is we'll probably have, when this is over, 300 different, like, APIs or agents going out to collect all this data and centralize it. So if it takes you two days to do an acquisition underwriting, because we're our goal is to streamline all of this data collection for you. Can you get it down to twenty minutes or an hour? And how do I think that that's automate. Yeah. I mean, that would be an a really interesting hook, especially if it's from sources. You know, you we we're working with all the, you know, chat, b c, everything, but the sources Mhmm. Can be really problematic. So mean, I think having access immediately to source and having contained in one file Mhmm. Is really

### You (2025-07-29T18:24:49.742Z)

Yeah. L l Ellen, if I if I could real quick,

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:24:52.829Z)

interesting. So I think that that would be you know, that adds a lot of

### You (2025-07-29T18:24:55.272Z)

you know, I've in in

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:24:56.659Z)

you know, inter I could see where that's a hook. Right?

### You (2025-07-29T18:24:57.442Z)

being respectful of your time, I there's a lot of stuff that I skipped over.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:25:00.379Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-29T18:25:02.882Z)

No. No. Yeah. Yeah. But I think you one of the things you ask, you know, what is the advantage? I I would say number one is

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:25:09.769Z)

Oh, no. No. I'm sure. And I I don't wanna sound whatever. I'm just yeah.

efficiency and to even go further than that, Right now, we are working on the ability to extract the data. We we already have the ability. We we can upload a financial data, use AI, extract that data, and and put it in the database. Right? That's where we get that historical information. However,

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:25:34.789Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-29T18:25:35.002Z)

we can also pull in things that are, for example, on on an off memorandum, a PDF document lot of that time, lot of those will contain historical financial and maybe even the broker will include their own pro form a projections. Market descriptions, information that very important that we can automate this. I I think our goal is to get at least 85 to 90% of this model prepopulated. So that you don't have to go there. So, you know, imagine if a broker did include the pro form a projections in an offering memorandum, we automatically extract that put that into your projections, and that way you don't have to go line by line and input everything. Right? You can just say, yeah. I just that looks alright. But, oh, wait. You know, this one's out of line. I wanna change it. You know, way, way faster than what we can do. And then then to tack on to what Diane was mentioning, yeah, we we already have experimented with going out and grabbing tax information on a parcel.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:26:38.179Z)

Yeah. I get it. Yeah. That's yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:26:40.739Z)

Yeah. That's helpful.

transaction, data on a parcel. It's it's getting way way easier to do that. So a lot of the technology is new. It's not a 100%. Right? It might be 80 or 85% accurate, which I'm not so comfortable going out to market with a new product with you know, until it gets better. But it's it's you know, we all know it. It AI is is expanding at a breathtaking pace. Right? It's it's

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:27:07.029Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-29T18:27:09.452Z)

it's not there today. It could be there next week. Right? The way it's going. So

### Guest (2025-07-29T18:27:22.249Z)

And, Ellen, one other thing that we have in the background, and Drew is a really important member of our team. He he has mapped 50 management companies against each other from a chart of accounts. So while we showed you a manual mean, it's it's automatic, but it's manual entry to begin with. Right? Once this gets going completely believe we'll be able to work with the management community to essentially start almost like an automatic transfer of the data from I was working on a potential disposition for a contract I was working on HEI was the manager. It was a potential disposition and refi. Right, at the same time. In this if we fast forward a year from now, we will have an API integration with HEI where they're able to just transmit the data directly into InnVest and Yeah. No. That's through the transaction you know, the eighth month or however long it's taking, we're they're able to transmit it, update the trailing 12. So just do all of that automatically. So that the user does not have to go in and, you know, roll that back up as the is progressing. We're not there yet. Right? We have to we have to walk. We have to to crawl before we even walk and then run. But Drew's ability to map all these management companies against each other is a really wonderful starting point for us, and we'll be building these relationships the management companies over time. Yeah. And then and then another benefit, Allan, is is that you know, if if you're a owner of a portfolio of hotels, by having all of the data for each of the hotels that you own and put it in a consistent way, you'll be able to do comparisons within the portfolio and see real time, you know, data points in terms of how assets are performing relative to each other. Yeah. So, you know, one of the challenges in the industry today is that, you know, most companies don't report and analyze their data in a consistent way. And if everyone's data is input and analyzed differently, it makes it impossible compare and contrast. So by having everything formatted in a consistent way, allows you to compare and then ultimately you know, as we build AI functionality, in order for AI to be most effective, everything needs to be input in a consistent way. So know, is really all about, you know, consistency of data and reporting. No. I think that's really helpful. And we have those problems with the portfolio. So it is it is And and, actually, we are trying to use AI to figure out how to do it. We're still working towards not great with Excel, but it does sound like with all of these other in addition to the model, which is great, I think it's really all the other information that you're bringing into it. That's to me where I think you get the the real value add. In terms of being having access to certain formats and stuff. And I'm I hate to say this, but I actually really do have to jump to this other deal call. But you know, Diane or Mark, if there's anything you wanna follow-up with and and Howard and Drew, thank you so much for your time. And it does it does look really impressive. You know, let me know. We can find some other time.

### You (2025-07-29T18:30:27.072Z)
