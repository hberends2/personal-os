### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:24.299Z)

So

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:25.665Z)

because they were just CPRE,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:26.699Z)

because they worked at CBRE,

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:29.185Z)

and

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:29.829Z)

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:30.345Z)

worked in the home.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:31.659Z)

in the VAS group when I was at CBRE.

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:32.305Z)

The home. When I was at CBRE. I went with the schools with the

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:35.399Z)

I had breakfast once with the appraisal leader for the Northeast Region, and he knew Evan really, really well.

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:36.425Z)

appraisal meeting for the Northeast Region. He knew Evan really, really well. And

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:42.629Z)

And we were talking. I'm like, would there ever be an opportune

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:42.785Z)

were talking, like, with the number of the opportunities to come back to CBRE to kind of

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:45.669Z)

to come back to CBRE to kind of lead an advisory team?

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:49.165Z)

19. And he said, I

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:50.639Z)

And he said, I don't think so because Evan makes

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:51.745Z)

think so. Because Evan sets $100,000 year

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:55.319Z)

$700,000 a year, and so he makes more than

### You (2025-06-27T18:08:57.085Z)

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:08:59.479Z)

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:09:04.689Z)

### You (2025-06-27T18:09:06.485Z)

can think fit back.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:09:08.519Z)

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:28.755Z)

And then if you like our platform, maybe the consulting fee that

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:30.999Z)

maybe the consulting fee then converts into

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:32.495Z)

converts into

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:35.769Z)

pre c capital or something along those lines.

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:35.875Z)

capital. Or something along those lines. Right. So that

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:40.289Z)

Right? So that we would be doing something for them

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:40.875Z)

we would be doing something for them that might also

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:43.969Z)

that might also benefit us

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:44.645Z)

us. And and

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:46.899Z)

And

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:47.365Z)

build their own

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:47.639Z)

building a relationship that could lead to a little bit of pre seed capital.

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:48.275Z)

relationship that could lead to freeze. Capital. And then

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:52.429Z)

And then I just I I guess this

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:52.905Z)

guess I guess this is I think in my mind,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:54.669Z)

thing in my mind is too is

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:54.875Z)

too is our are they gonna go after a luster and white

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:12:56.749Z)

our are they gonna go after a lesser and wise? Because if they are,

### You (2025-06-27T18:12:58.895Z)

because they are, we're we're

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:01.159Z)

we're we're a more

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:01.665Z)

cost effective

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:02.739Z)

cost effective alternative, I'm sure. Right? Because we're

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:03.195Z)

alternative. I'm sure. Right? Because we're just starting to have

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:06.579Z)

just starting out, so we basically have no value other than

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:06.895Z)

So basically no value. Other than so prepaid, you know, $12,000,000 of free line value that we're gonna make up.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:11.279Z)

some premade, you know, $12,000,000 pre money value that we're gonna make up.

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:16.105Z)

But then we have to have to pay

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:16.969Z)

But they would actually have to pay for lesser and

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:18.055Z)

for lesser and whites. Right? And then we would have to absorb damn in heaven

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:20.019Z)

Right? And then they would have to absorb Dan and Evan in at high salaries.

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:22.045Z)

and and high salaries and things like that. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:24.239Z)

And things like that.

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:25.575Z)

So I recalled, but that is what I wanted.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:27.019Z)

So I rambled, but that is what I wanna and

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:30.005Z)

I'm not asking you

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:30.939Z)

I'm not asking it necessarily for you to do anything. I just wanted you to, like,

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:31.165Z)

in this do anything. I just wanted you to, like, have this in trouble and

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:13:35.769Z)

have this intel and just think on it a little bit.

### You (2025-06-27T18:13:36.765Z)

just think on it a little bit. Yeah. No. I I I appreciate that. In fact, I was also gonna suggest that you and I start setting aside two days a week for just a little half hour catch up If you wanna take a look at your calendar and see when you're available because we are getting to the point we have to start going through a lot of the the paperwork. And getting this thing up and ready. You know, when I put that analysis together yesterday and it talked about setting up an 83 b and all these different things that we have to do. I mean, we're we're gonna have to get an attorney. You know, we're gonna have to get a CPA and get all these things going. And then I know we are gonna

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:14:20.049Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:14:21.065Z)

money for that yet, but I just wanna make sure that we're we don't miss anything. And at least start putting together a list of items and brainstorming. So, you know, if you've got a couple days to work, you know, half you can block off, let me know.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:14:34.499Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:14:38.835Z)

One of the things that popped into mind is you mentioned that there might be a possibility that they might be splitting or making a change there.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:14:48.769Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:14:50.165Z)

What if we partnered with Lark? I've heard Lark mention by yourself and Drew. A lot.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:14:56.859Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:14:56.915Z)

I don't know anything about but the whole value proposition of our tool

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:15:04.759Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:15:05.335Z)

is data. I've said that over and over again. It's not just creating a AVM. It's what we can do

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:15:14.489Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:15:15.465Z)

AVM. And if we could partner with somebody who is already a name in the industry, and utilize their their data.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:15:28.259Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:15:30.385Z)

That would be good. Even if they move forward with Burkadia, if we've got a contract with them, then know, we could still

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:15:37.219Z)

Partner.

### You (2025-06-27T18:15:37.625Z)

more like most likely Okay. Carry that through even if with Burkadia and continue. You know, that's that's what they did with Red IQ. Red IQ you know, already had JLL, CBRE, Walker and Dunlop, and all those clients before Berecadia bought them. And then after Berecadia bought them, they stayed on. And, you know, it could potentially be something

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:02.219Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:05.685Z)

similar here. So that's one thing. If there ever is an opportunity for them for Berecadia to buy them, I would hope that we could have something in place if it's all if it's possible. I don't know if it's even possible.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:24.049Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:25.245Z)

You know? Given that Mark knows them, you know them, you know, unless there's some bad blood somewhere between you guys, think, you know, it would be worth a phone call.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:36.909Z)

There's no bad blood on the lark's

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:37.385Z)

They're damage on the large

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:40.439Z)

side, and there's no bad blood on the

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:40.875Z)

blood on the

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:42.699Z)

Dan and Evan side.

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:43.315Z)

side? Other than that,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:44.959Z)

Other than what I'll say is Dan holding he holds things super close to the vest,

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:45.065Z)

what I'll say damn, He holds things super close to the Yeah. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:50.999Z)

Right? And so does Mark. Right? And and that's good because they're they are protecting

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:51.245Z)

Smart. Right? And that's good because they're are protecting you know, their internal

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:16:55.969Z)

you know, their intern But it's

### You (2025-06-27T18:16:56.575Z)

Yes. But it's it's so

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:17:00.799Z)

so there's a lot of ego. There's this when you get with

### You (2025-06-27T18:17:01.525Z)

you want go and just just get doing.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:17:04.659Z)

Dan and Evan, there's a lot of ego

### You (2025-06-27T18:17:06.015Z)

Yeah. That's that's involved.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:17:07.059Z)

that's involved.

### You (2025-06-27T18:17:08.255Z)

And and and

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:17:09.399Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-27T18:17:10.165Z)

that doesn't surprise me. And that's why, you know, obviously, we're not in a position to go and buy a company. But know, I would wanna avoid them trying to buy us. You know, unless they make an offer we can't refuse.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:17:25.349Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-27T18:17:26.955Z)

Right. We're gonna give up all control and and gonna do it. But if we were partners, if we had a contract and they agree to sharing their data, or us using their data subscribing to it, or doing whatever we can to you know, when when a InnVest user creates a deal, they're going through their analysis and we want to have third party, I know we got HPIS, But my biggest concern with Drew is that he has such a small portion of the industry.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:01.899Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:04.875Z)

That unless an InnVest user is looking at a deal that he has in his database which is like a small slice of the pie, we're gonna have to get data from somewhere else. Or a lot of the features that we excuse me. A lot of the features that we want to provide we can't provide until we build up the database and that could take years. So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:30.119Z)

Unless and unless

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:33.495Z)

it's like she becomes such a

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:34.359Z)

like, he becomes such a part like, and then I know I have to have this conversation with him

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:38.165Z)

got

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:38.759Z)

Again, I'm just waiting until the day where we actually get to the

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:39.115Z)

until the day. Like, get to the point where I

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:41.779Z)

point where it write pencils, and then it's but

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:42.175Z)

write pencils and everything. But so

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:46.319Z)

so

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:46.945Z)

let me take an example. I'm

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:47.349Z)

let me take an example. I'm very, very good friend

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:48.315Z)

very, different with deep

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:50.609Z)

with Davidson Hotel Group.

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:50.695Z)

Hotel Group.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:53.079Z)

They helped me early in my career.

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:53.515Z)

They helped me my career And in return

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:18:56.639Z)

And in return, I gave them business. And Steve Margall, who is

### You (2025-06-27T18:18:57.275Z)

I gave them business and Steve Arnold who is like, their chairman

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:01.609Z)

like, their chairman, is one of my one of my mentors.

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:02.225Z)

It So I'm.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:05.249Z)

So I'm chatting with them just as, again, my friend.

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:06.925Z)

My friend. For a whole new day.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:08.269Z)

Right? All I'm doing right now is just going to my the closest people in my network

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:08.505Z)

Now, I'm just going to my the closest people in my network. Get advice on this.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:12.729Z)

and getting advice on this. So what I was hoping to ask

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:14.125Z)

So what I was hoping that I ask that

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:17.319Z)

them to do

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:17.665Z)

to do if to test

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:19.689Z)

is to test out

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:20.335Z)

out like, if if

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:22.329Z)

like, if we if if there was a hotel that went to market

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:23.245Z)

if there was a hotel went to market,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:26.499Z)

and it was a Davidson managed hotel, but it's not in Drew's portfolio. Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:30.635Z)

Right? Yeah. Can we

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:32.349Z)

Can we still transmit it

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:32.525Z)

still train it? From deep?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:35.179Z)

from Davidson to Drew and then into InvestAI Because the only thing that would have to change versus what is now

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:35.185Z)

Davidson? To Drew? And then into Invest because the only thing I would have to change for to switch it now is the

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:44.819Z)

is the owner whoever that

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:45.575Z)

is who have that owner would be,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:47.699Z)

owner would be, would have to say to Davidson,

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:47.805Z)

would have say that they had sent released the data

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:50.569Z)

release the data to Drew. Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:51.575Z)

Correct? Yeah. So it's it becomes an

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:19:53.329Z)

So it's it becomes an owner change of behavior. Then Drew's database

### You (2025-06-27T18:19:54.695Z)

older behavior. And then Drew said, for zero. And I know

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:01.249Z)

grows and grows. And I know we have to deal with the whole thing. Like, who's Drew? Who are we? Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:02.255Z)

to do, like, the whole thing, like, culture. But

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:06.729Z)

But

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:06.735Z)

that's

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:07.859Z)

that's

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:09.205Z)

point

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:09.219Z)

Drew brought up the point that

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:09.895Z)

that our differentiating factors that everyone else is getting to chew

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:11.289Z)

our differentiating factor is that everyone else is getting to geo

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:14.955Z)

p. But we're getting the NOI.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:16.809Z)

but we're getting to NOI

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:18.345Z)

Right? Because we

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:19.229Z)

Right? Because we need NOI to underwrite.

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:19.325Z)

need NOI to underwrite. Right. He's at right. That is a that is

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:21.949Z)

He's absolutely right. That is an that is

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:23.475Z)

that just us in a different ballgame.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:24.319Z)

just puts us in a different ballgame than everyone else.

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:25.085Z)

Than everyone else. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:27.759Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:28.875Z)

I mean, That's something that we've talked about since day one, is that if we do partner with Drew or whatever we do, would be a cross sell.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:40.699Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:41.745Z)

Opportunity. And that's that's that's true. I mean, if if we do have an investor who comes comes in, sets up a deal, it's not an HBIS. What you described is one alternative. Another alternative is that they send the data to us.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:20:57.749Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:20:58.115Z)

But we go to HPIS. Right? We it it adds an extra step, but we're talking millis

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:04.169Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:07.135Z)

Right? Oh, I'm citrus.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:07.549Z)

Oh, I see what you're saying. They send it to us, and then we somehow have to

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:08.265Z)

You're saying. They're saying that The Us

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:11.859Z)

transmit it to HBI. That Drew can, like, load it and map it and

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:16.155Z)

Right. So if if they had to go through Drew, and they had to subscribe to Drew. Drew's product to do that. I don't know how he's got it set up. Don't know what his monetization is, but that would that would be a pain point. For the users. Like,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:36.469Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:37.045Z)

what is the they don't wanna subscribe to HPIS?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:38.939Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:40.825Z)

They've already got coming from some other company. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:21:42.889Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:21:44.745Z)

But if they wanna use InnVest, there's no reason why why we can't just funnel that data to Drew, let him do his thing. And it comes back to InnVest. It would start and end with us.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:01.669Z)

I see your point, and I see why that could be an advantage.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:02.315Z)

Point. And I why the meeting.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:05.889Z)

Right? Because then we're not it's like Drew's in sitting

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:07.215Z)

It's like in the back. Right? And and

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:09.809Z)

in the background. Right? And right? Almost as, a white label

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:11.515Z)

Right. Label. Kind of solution. Yeah. Where you use technology. Got it. So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:14.539Z)

kind of solution, but the date has come vast.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:18.125Z)

yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:19.069Z)

Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:19.525Z)

Right. Because Vinodo And we have a. I think that is really

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:20.599Z)

Right. I like that idea, Howard. I think I actually yeah.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:23.895Z)

Yeah. I would in fact, I would I would argue.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:24.929Z)

Go ahead.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:27.885Z)

Against. Having them to be an HBIS client?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:31.619Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:34.495Z)

We would just have to build into our pricing structure that if they're not an HPIS client, part of that revenue would go to to Drew, but I would I would probably sell it the other way around. Know, here is our price at x dollars. If you're an HBIS client, we'll give you a 5% discount. Rather than saying if you're not an HPIS

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:22:57.589Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:22:58.705Z)

we gotta charge you another $200. Right? So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:02.549Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:03.275Z)

I don't think don't think that would be a problem at all.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:04.339Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:07.035Z)

And and Drew's going into these conversations as well. This is not a surprise because Vinod and I realized that what Drew is doing is is is not as difficult as what people think.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:21.519Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:21.665Z)

And if we Okay. If we were not to use Drew, then it just means gonna set us back a little bit. Couple weeks or a few weeks. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:31.449Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:33.165Z)

And I and I am oversimplifying it. I probably can't do all of the reports that he puts together, but I'm talking about just the processing of the data.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:40.799Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:41.685Z)

Getting the data in processing it, putting it in the database not that difficult.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:48.899Z)

Mapping it.

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:49.595Z)

Right. So And and then they're take the cross

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:50.549Z)

And and the mapping across

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:52.545Z)

hard to mapping across

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:23:52.869Z)

and, Howard, the mapping across management companies

### You (2025-06-27T18:23:54.335Z)

management companies. Yeah. That's that would that would take a little bit of time, but once you've got it I mean, once you've got the the knowledge of how to do it, it's just a matter of doing it. So I have to

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:07.739Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:09.595Z)

This is the classic mousetrap. You know, I don't want I don't wanna replicate and duplicate what we already have access to. So that's why I think it's really important to partner with Drew. Some way or another. Either he becomes a partner in InnVest or we just partner with him. But let him process the data. He's already got the he's already got it set up. And that would that's what I was

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:33.289Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:35.065Z)

counting on to to get us to market faster. So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:38.659Z)

I like the

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:40.865Z)

I your I comes to us

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:43.059Z)

that it comes to us though versus through him.

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:43.975Z)

though, versus through him. Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:46.649Z)

And one one clarification, I never did

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:46.675Z)

what one third certification, I never did a sync that video.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:49.699Z)

assume that if the data went through HPIS, they would become his

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:49.965Z)

Went. It would be computed stats. Management client.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:53.169Z)

asset management client.

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:54.125Z)

Mhmm. I really

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:55.389Z)

I really just thought of it as, like, a transmission path.

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:55.665Z)

that like, a train Yeah. Yeah. Like,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:24:58.739Z)

Right? Like, he would be the piping

### You (2025-06-27T18:24:59.395Z)

she And then

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:01.939Z)

And then the that

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:02.345Z)

that people really

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:03.779Z)

well, really, it's on the buy side. Then the owner

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:04.915Z)

side

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:07.119Z)

the new owner can choose They wanna have Drew in as their asset management provider. Right? Does that make sense? Because

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:12.855Z)

Right? Sense?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:16.139Z)

now they've got the data, and they can have him it's really easy to have him be their ass

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:16.145Z)

Data. Now it's it's real

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:20.179Z)

management provider. But, but I like the idea of it just coming to us, and then we send it to Drew. It's cleaner and more understandable for the client.

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:28.915Z)

for audience. Yeah. I mean, are there are a million companies out there that

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:32.839Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:35.385Z)

it's basically we're just outsourcing.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:25:37.669Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:25:38.115Z)

Right? Be no different than hiring somebody in India to hand input. This into an Excel spreadsheet. Right? Same thing. You know, we would have to probably have some we'd have to get an attorney to make sure that somehow, I'm sure that our clients would need to know that maybe their data is going through HPIS. We would have to have some type of some some something in the agreement that basically says, know, we're using them to process this data of however the data will always be between you and InnVestAI. But for Drew, you know, like I said, he would he would get some revenue from it. And and it's an upsell opportunity for him then. So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:26:20.489Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:26:24.245Z)

you know, he could always go in and say,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:26:25.769Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:26:26.215Z)

you know, we're working with InnVestAI. We process the data. You know, we've got an opportunity here to do whatever.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:26:36.419Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:26:38.795Z)

So so, yeah, that's that's what I would hope to do, but that doesn't really answer what LARC we can do with them. But yeah. Well, Larkin's different, doesn't it?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:26:51.309Z)

Well, Lark is different, though, because Lark is, like, destination data. That's, like, market data. Does that make

### You (2025-06-27T18:26:55.505Z)

Data. That's, like, data. Does that explain

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:26:59.349Z)

sense? Like, they're, like, the

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:00.105Z)

they're the put them

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:03.109Z)

the I mean, I don't even know what variables they're pulling, but it's more they pull 20 economic variables and you

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:10.875Z)

more pool.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:13.619Z)

those variables to come up with a market cast for

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:17.845Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:18.349Z)

RevPAR.

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:19.345Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:20.439Z)

I have heard chatter. I mean, this is what I hear in the industry.

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:23.415Z)

I

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:23.759Z)

At CBRE,

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:25.985Z)

seen I have their

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:26.439Z)

where the brokers have their own

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:27.145Z)

home. Force. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:28.839Z)

data source. Right? Rachel Rothman pulls that data up.

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:30.055Z)

Pull that data off The actually

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:32.279Z)

They actually go to Lark in a closed door meeting

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:32.585Z)

go to

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:37.249Z)

every month to go market by market through what

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:37.295Z)

to go the changes. Are.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:41.789Z)

the changes are and what's going on. And I don't know if that's, again, a

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:45.055Z)

Matter

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:45.649Z)

Habiro thing or if they truly believe that large data is better, Mark Woodworth, who is, like, the

### You (2025-06-27T18:27:51.645Z)

would work you doing?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:27:54.959Z)

grandfather of data in our industry, will say, I have no idea how Lark does what they claim they do. They think it's impossible

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:00.735Z)

Does. What they claim. They do.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:05.009Z)

that whatever Ryan does that he's capable of doing that.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:06.875Z)

Of doing. That. But that's

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:08.929Z)

But that's the chitter chatter I've heard in the industry about

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:09.305Z)

the center counter. Heard. Industry about both. You know, like,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:13.299Z)

both, you know, like,

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:13.975Z)

Mark stuff like that. But but, like,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:15.089Z)

Lark and stuff like that. But but, like, they would be, like,

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:16.935Z)

be like amazing.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:18.109Z)

but it could be amazing. Right? Because then you just plug in, and it's like, oh,

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:18.225Z)

Right, is that you just plug in. Like, you know.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:21.939Z)

You're investing in

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:24.195Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:24.299Z)

Baltimore. Right? Here's all this Baltimore data.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:24.615Z)

Here's all this Baltimore data. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:27.469Z)

Right? You you have the macroeconomic forecast for Baltimore.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:27.555Z)

Macroeconomic forecast or Baltimore

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:30.519Z)

You know where all the demand drivers are. You know where the sports stadiums are, and things along those lines. So

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:37.225Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:38.799Z)

convention business, stuff like that.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:39.395Z)

stuff like that. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:43.629Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:43.955Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:45.169Z)

So

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:45.845Z)

anyway

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:46.189Z)

anyway, just think like, just let yourself, like, mull over the whole brick

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:46.225Z)

think what you said you're like, all over the whole

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:28:50.559Z)

Berecadia thing. Because one thing is when the analyst comes to join the and for us to show the analyst the proof of concept.

### You (2025-06-27T18:28:58.455Z)

the proof of concept. Mhmm. Maybe we wanna invite someone from the technology

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:01.509Z)

Maybe we wanna invite someone from the technology group too. Like, I I don't know someone that you and Vinod know that might wanna

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:03.295Z)

group. Too. Like, I don't know. What that you would would know. One

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:09.639Z)

sit in as well, or perhaps that's not a good

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:10.835Z)

Or perhaps it's not a good stretch. Like, you guys

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:13.019Z)

strategy. Like, you guys know the technology team better, and

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:13.035Z)

know that tech technology team. Better. And just don't know who has control

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:16.979Z)

you just don't know who has control

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:18.085Z)

within companies. Sometimes

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:18.979Z)

within a company sometimes. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:19.985Z)

Right? Like, us. Where the senior

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:23.049Z)

right at CBRE, the technology teams are

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:24.105Z)

technology teams are slowly gaining.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:26.129Z)

slowly gaining control. But at the end of the day, the brokers have the end say.

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:26.185Z)

Control. But at the end of the day, brokers have the you know, say. Yeah. But I don't know the

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:29:33.649Z)

But I don't know what it's like at Berends.

### You (2025-06-27T18:29:33.945Z)

like in Arcadia. It it's it's similar. I would probably argue against bringing anybody in, number one, because they may realize it's something they could build on their own. And and and that's why they bought Run IQ to to begin with. Is to to have just the valuation model. That's That's all they were looking for. And then when it got integrated with Bereq, he we started to kind of mingle some of the technology. So Red IQ still had a better rent roll processor. But Berecadia had a better financial statement processor. And eventually it got to the point where BERCADIA could handle both rent rolls and financial statements their rent roll process or wasn't as good.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:30:30.179Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:30:30.985Z)

It was slow. But for internal use, it served its purpose.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:30:34.199Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:30:36.725Z)

So RedIQ, that's that's why I think RedIQ kinda became more disposable at that point, that they Right. So I I would I would fear something similar, not

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:30:43.059Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:30:47.185Z)

that they would I mean, if they bought InnVestAI, you know, that's can do whatever they wanna do. But if they see what we're doing and they've already got some of that technology in place, I'd be a little bit more nervous. But you know, I don't think the brokerage team, if we just focus on them, let them make the decision, It would be cloud based for them. You know, if they are sounds to me like like they have to probably have multiple logins in BERCADIA.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:21.519Z)

It may

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:22.935Z)

In order to get different data

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:25.949Z)

it may be because a lot of those

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:28.225Z)

brokerage houses started out

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:29.089Z)

brokerage houses started out as independent

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:30.165Z)

as independent. Regional offices. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:33.039Z)

regional offices.

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:34.075Z)

You know, like

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:34.849Z)

You know, like, that were owned independently, and then they kinda merged into

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:35.075Z)

we're all independently and that they kinda work. So might be the history of why the technology exists

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:39.459Z)

so that might be the history of why the technology exists that way.

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:41.905Z)

that way. Yeah. But we could go to each server and pull their data off and help them

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:44.599Z)

But if we could go to each server and pull their data off and help them

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:47.885Z)

aggregate it and pull it up into the cloud Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:48.849Z)

aggregate it and pull it up into the cloud,

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:51.325Z)

That would be a valuable thing for them. And that might be more

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:51.889Z)

that would be a valuable thing for them. And that might be worth

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:55.305Z)

don't know how much that's worth, like, a couple 100 k. Is that I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:55.929Z)

I don't know how much that's worth, like, couple 100 k. Is that I mean,

### You (2025-06-27T18:31:58.805Z)

you know, 200 k, something like that. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:31:59.859Z)

you know, 200 k, something like that. Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:01.795Z)

Yeah. And then the consulting assignment,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:32:02.799Z)

And as a consulting assignment, 200 k us would give us a lifeline of, like, three months, you know, to be able to

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:04.455Z)

200 k for us would give us a lifeline of, like, three months, you know, to be able to I mean, even if it's just a consulting agreement,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:32:11.389Z)

I mean, even if it's just a consulting agreement and it's our revenue and we just walk away with

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:12.765Z)

that's our revenue. We just walk away with the revenue. We could use some of that revenue

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:32:15.789Z)

the revenue, we could use some of that revenue to

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:17.425Z)

to to help with

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:32:18.739Z)

to help with the cost that we're gonna start to incur. Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:18.895Z)

the cost that that start to occur. Right? Yeah. We can go direct

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:32:56.949Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:32:57.455Z)

what I always participated in the meetings or the they would always have a demo date twice a year where the vendors that are in being engaged would show off their products and give a little dog and pony show and and you know, try to get some feedback from everybody. But they don't acquire the products. They're not owned by Berends, they do have that incubator. And I don't know what type of financial investment they typically make. But, I mean,

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:33:28.519Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:33:28.885Z)

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:38.035Z)

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:35:39.779Z)

It is.

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:40.075Z)

It is. So It is. It is still happening. Something. It's too much of a need.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:35:44.099Z)

It is gonna happen. It's too much of a needed product

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:46.135Z)

Product. Yeah. And Mark is too much of a, like, connected

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:35:47.789Z)

and Mark is too much of a a, like, connected in the industry

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:50.525Z)

industry for this not to work.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:35:52.099Z)

for this not to work. So

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:53.205Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:35:54.139Z)

okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:35:54.555Z)

Yeah. Well, I can just tell you the proof of concept is going really well. Drew provided me some sample tu templates for market data. And so those have been incorporated into the model. The problem that I'm having is, and I mentioned it in my email, that these tools that I'm using are designed for proof of concept, but they're really I'm I'm stretching them probably beyond the limit. Let's just Yeah. On underneath.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:36:28.309Z)

Yeah. On their use.

### You (2025-06-27T18:36:30.495Z)

Yeah. So I fixed something Something else breaks. And I kinda went through that this morning. I was working on the reserve for replacement based on the total revenue. And it went through, and all of a sudden, like, four things stopped working. Know it. So I had to revert back and and and so that's kinda where I'm at right now. It's like I really it works fine if I'm working in other areas.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:37:01.449Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:37:03.615Z)

So you know, like the model that I have and and things like that. I can I don't have any problem at all? That's, you know, I was able to get Drew's stuff in in like five minutes and it's fine. But in that valuation model itself, it is it's it's almost maxed out. So I don't think that I'm going to be able to get the valuation in that same page. But I think what I'll have to do is and when I say the valuation, the financing, the acquisition and and disposition assumptions, all of those things. And it might be better to have those on a page anyway. So it's like

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:37:47.729Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:37:49.155Z)

valuation would be all operation. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:37:52.139Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-27T18:37:52.565Z)

And then you can have another one that's more financial. And then

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:37:57.349Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:37:57.445Z)

the two together. Can be combined. And I don't I don't think I'll have a problem doing it that way. I'll just have to be very, very careful. I think the one I know, would picture different

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:06.929Z)

Think the one nomenclature different for us is that when you say valuation

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:08.725Z)

for us. Is that we you say evaluation, we as a as an industry probably call that

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:11.779Z)

we as a as an industry probably call that

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:13.515Z)

pro form a work or underwriting work. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:14.669Z)

pro form a work or underwriting work.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:16.805Z)

And then the financial piece is what we then call value

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:17.869Z)

And then the financial piece is what we then call valuation, if that makes sense.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:20.005Z)

if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did change Because it needs Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:22.819Z)

Yeah. But those are just names. Right?

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:24.835Z)

And I changed it in the model to be pro form a. It doesn't say valuation anymore in the sidebar.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:25.949Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:30.955Z)

Says pro form a, but you know, if makes more sense when I start putting in that information for the financing and everything, I can just

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:38.219Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:38.305Z)

call that the valuation section. So okay. That that helps. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:42.149Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:42.995Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:44.219Z)

Okay. Thanks.

### You (2025-06-27T18:38:44.375Z)

Alright. So Thanks for thanks for the info.

### Guest (2025-06-27T18:38:45.709Z)
