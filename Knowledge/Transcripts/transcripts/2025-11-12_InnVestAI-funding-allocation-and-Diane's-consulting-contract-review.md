### Guest (2025-11-12T22:32:54.292Z)

I don't hear. Any. One minute. Howard is. In. Okay? I think we all are on audio, right? Yeah, I am on my computer. Yeah, okay. It's fine. Oh, yeah. No video needed. Okay? I'm going to share my screen if you guys are able to. See? Yes. Beautiful background there. Okay? All right. Can you guys read this? Yes. Okay?

### You (2025-11-12T22:34:15.967Z)

Into a large screen here. Hold on.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:34:23.652Z)

There should be a button on the little thingy where it says maximize true limits. There was a note for me that content is being shared and I clicked on View button and then I see that. Window now.

### You (2025-11-12T22:34:41.007Z)

I can see it.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:34:41.412Z)

Okay? All right. So this one. I think this is easy. We all agree to this. As does. Mark. This. I think drew the first one. We have to have an account for that, right? Right? Yeah. That's the whole point, is that we get the LLC agreed to so that we can open the bank account and then do this. Right. So this tech development, right? And obviously. Developing the product is the most important thing. So we want to get as much as we can of the money to go towards that. So.

### You (2025-11-12T22:35:32.607Z)

's.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:35:34.532Z)

I went to. I took our. Budget. Right. This is the budget that we've had. And I mean.

### You (2025-11-12T22:35:51.407Z)

Saved on the team site. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:35:53.252Z)

Correct? Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T22:35:53.967Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:36:01.252Z)

The product, you know, engineering team, the technology team. Right. We have. The 800,000. I think I paid 1400 in our in the last payment. And I'm assuming if nothing has changed, the next one or two will be 1400, and then we want to be able to increase what we're paying the existing team. Potentially add some additional team members. Right. That's. Really, you know, top one of the top priorities and then the other is. The, you know, cloud, you know. The hardware software, right? Costs that we have, which we expect to go up. So basically, I took. That budget. Those amounts that just. I'm just pulling it over here. Five months. So starting in November, for reference. So here's what's already been spent. By me. And Howard, he said 900. That you have spent on other things, on various things.

### You (2025-11-12T22:37:07.247Z)

It was like 6:70 a couple of months ago. And. It's eight something. Now.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:37:14.452Z)

Yeah, I don't. I don't know if Diane has anything that she spent. You know, Vinod, I don't know if you have anything you spent. But I have nothing. Okay? So reimbursing you. Howard. 900. And then all of my costs, you know, 1,000 for legal so far. Probably going to be more. 350 for caries collateral, 2,400 for cloud hosting services. And other actually, I think this 2400. Is more than just cloud hosting, it's all of these software. Yeah. Costs. Plus, I think there might be some on a different credit card, so this might actually be a little higher. 2600 for the offshore engineering team. So far. Right? So that puts us at 8,300. So, you know, for me, I guess there's also a contingency in here, so I could probably zero that out, actually. So that is it. Is it you that's been paying for most of these things? Yes, Me personally. Out of my personal bank account. Okay, gotcha. So.

### You (2025-11-12T22:38:31.727Z)

Your original $7,500.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:38:35.812Z)

That's it. It's been spent. Now.

### You (2025-11-12T22:38:37.327Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:38:39.492Z)

So when we open the bank account, I will likely not be getting anything. I will not put anything into it. I will. Put a journal entry to Mark. That I, you know, like. Yeah. And then. And it. You know, I can't recall if I think Mark and I said we would do this as a loan. With, you know, so we'll get repaid with interest. That you know at the next raise. Which you know. So that'll be, you know, let's say sometime later this, you know, or early next year or whatever. So. But that's going to be in this bucket, and it can be. The next bucket. So if you see here, I have four buckets here, right? So this. This one is the two. Two be raised. This is Mark's money, which really, you know. We will start spending this next. And then. Then there's the money from Driftwood. So I started to look at, you know, here's our monthly expenses. How much? You know, how are we going to allocate this money? I said, you know, this basically is just all this is doing is saying how many months, like through the through month seven here through January. I know the numbering is a little confusing, but basically trying to say, like, how, you know, how much, you know, where do we put this money, you know, for how many months of expenses on each of these rows. So. Cloud hosting. I mean, I said we. You know, obviously, we need to be able to cover that. This covers us through March. You're. Excuse me. Through February, on the cloud hosting. And, you know, technology, infrastructure costs. There's this covers us through. I think we want to give the engineering team as much. Longevity, you know, in how we allocate or, you know, kind of commit these funds. Right. So this is. This 12,800 is through April for them. But that doesn't include any additional. Right? Like, no additional resources until we get more money. And then. Paying back, and this can actually go to zero. So we have a little bit more money back. So two months of 8500, which is going to go has to go as a loan. Basically because we. I don't think we will have payroll set up yet. 900 reimbursed you, Howard. And so, yeah. We can actually, basically, and this is just like, how are we going to dedicate this money, right? And yes, we can say. I mean, Mark studies. I mean, he. He's literally. He did say 50%. I think he was under the impression that Diane's going to take half. Which is.

### You (2025-11-12T22:41:52.607Z)

Actually, yeah, when he and I spoke. So he didn't call me after I sent my response. And. He was quite upset, clearly. But he said something about why was he in the 85%. We need at least 50% for the devs. I'm like 85% and it's like, then it made sense. I think he was confusing aim $500 for 85%. I thought that was very serious. So hopefully when I pointed that out, hopefully he understands now. That she was never asking for 85% of that 75 grand. I think.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:42:31.812Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T22:42:31.967Z)

That's set him. Off a little bit.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:42:35.252Z)

Y. Eah. That. That would be. That would be very okay. But I do think she is asking. I mean, she's not just asking for a one time $8,500. I think she is expecting. She needs this to be a monthly thing.

### You (2025-11-12T22:42:49.887Z)

We need to clarify.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:42:50.212Z)

So.

### You (2025-11-12T22:42:51.087Z)

Though.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:42:53.412Z)

Yeah, we can clarify. That's sure.

### You (2025-11-12T22:42:56.927Z)

When she was talking about it when I had my college around Tuesday. She mainly mentioned this as a one time payout. So 8500. To her. And then she mentioned the 2000 when I told her I. Couldn't do it out. Just for the reimbursement. So, yeah, let's clarify that, because I kind of thought that. This is just a. One time payout. To her. And myself. And.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:43:43.972Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-12T22:43:46.127Z)

That definitely makes a difference because we've had many conversations as a team saying that we can't draw the salary until we've got revenue. Coming in.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:43:55.652Z)

Well.

### You (2025-11-12T22:43:55.727Z)

So really surprised that she's expecting that on a monthly basis.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:44:02.132Z)

That's fair. I. I did get the sense that is what she's expecting, but.

### You (2025-11-12T22:44:07.167Z)

Definitely ask.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:44:11.012Z)

Here. I'll take 8,500 of the monthly 12K. The way again. I don't know if we can go back on this, but. Nope, here we go. She's expecting that they will pay in November and December monthly amounts. 12,500 per month. And she'll take 80, 80, 500 of the monthly 12k. So I'm presuming that is each month.

### You (2025-11-12T22:44:56.767Z)

Okay? All right. I went through. The. Entire safe note. It does not say anything in the safe Note about monthly payments.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:45:09.332Z)

Yeah, it doesn't. I don't know why she did it. That's what I was, like, trying to tell her, like. I don't know why. Like she should not have taken the liberty of arranging. The. The accounting part of this. Like. That's not so. Again, one of these as well is like, this is just. Like.

### You (2025-11-12T22:45:29.407Z)

She also gave me a copy. Of the contract that she's got from a consultant. Abortion. And that doesn't say anything about monthly payments. Either.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:45:37.572Z)

No. Yes.

### You (2025-11-12T22:45:38.127Z)

Something that I definitely wanted to talk with. Her. To figure that.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:45:41.732Z)

Y. Eah. So it. It should all just be a one time payment.

### You (2025-11-12T22:45:42.207Z)

Out.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:45:44.852Z)

That, that. So. Okay, so, again, like, I'm. I expect. I. I'm pretty sure that she is expecting this to be a monthly, you know, so if we do it if for the next. Yeah. So if that's, you know, through February, that's $35,000. That's almost half. So.

### You (2025-11-12T22:46:08.367Z)

That. Can't be.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:46:12.132Z)

I mean. Yeah. I don't know. That's just. That's just what's in here right now for this 75,000 and how it's. Going to get used the other half. You know? We can do through March. You know, fund the. Excuse me. The current development team with no additions. Through April, we can do cloud hosting. Costs. I mean. It's. It's. We can really take the business through March, basically. With what we have. Or if we. If we need to hire more people. Then obviously that it's only going to, you know, that it's going to. Be february or january and. You know, we are trying to line up, obviously, additional investors, but. Chicken and egg, Right? Like we need something to coax. Them to invest. Anyway, so. Use the funds part, we can. Ask her about, but I'm Pretty sure it's 8,500amonth. And my suggestion is that we. This thing that I put together is part of what we. Like this gets signed as a business plan or something. Like this. Internally only doesn't need to be shared with Driftwood. But we agree that this is how the funds are going to get used.

### You (2025-11-12T22:47:42.367Z)

I've been trying to. Not. Take sides. And try to make sure that I understand both sides clearly. And. Because she sent me a copy of her contract. I've got to pull them up again. And. The compensation. I'll just read it. The total cost for services is $75,000, payable via a safe. Instrument. In best AI. Separate, safe documentation will be executed concurrently with this agreement.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:48:18.132Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T22:48:21.087Z)

Is that she's getting paid $75,000. Which is why she may feel that she can. Do that.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:48:29.972Z)

Yes, she. She did. That is much she did. She told Driftwood, basically. Like. You know, they're interested in investing in this anyway. But she said to make it a sure thing for you, I'll work for free, basically.

### You (2025-11-12T22:48:45.567Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:48:46.532Z)

And that. I. Mean, you can't go back on it. She's already done it. But that's like. Very, very. Makes this whole thing very, very, very complicated and puts her, all of us. In a massive disadvantage. So. And that. So, like, I. I don't know what Driftwood thinks they're paying, but if they were willing to just give her the money, Point blank. Then. I don't know. I don't know what they think they're investing in. Which is part of, you know, the last point of, like, we, you know, getting and getting Us. We need to meet Driftwood and we need to talk with them. Like they have said Diane. I don't know if Diane is just. You know? Footballing ideas. When she says, oh, we can incorporate Domino, they can incorporate us. Manny, their CTO can get involved, whatever. Like maybe she's just throwing ideas out. That's fine. But if she, you know, what has she shared with Driftwood? And what do they expect? Like, are these expectations that they have? I don't know. And I. I don't think she does anything of, you know, like. I don't think it's any ill. Intense. But it is, you know, everything that is done instead has consequences.

### You (2025-11-12T22:50:15.247Z)

Okay, that kind of helps you figure out where Mark's coming from as well. Because if she really is expecting. $8,500 each month. Her contract goes from October 14th through April 16th. That's six months. So that's $51,000. Of the 75,000. That would. Go to her if that's how she is treating this.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:50:46.292Z)

Yeah, I think that is.

### You (2025-11-12T22:50:48.607Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:50:58.772Z)

This one we can talk with Diane, but this is ultimately. Like we need to agree how this money is going to get used.

### You (2025-11-12T22:51:06.047Z)

Yeah. Well. I think, clearly, since her consulting contract, that's what it is, that this is payable via a safe note. I think the safe note agreement takes precedence, but I'm not an attorney. Sort of. The question is, there's nothing in the safe note that says how it has to be handled. But I think. For us. We. Would have to treat. That the entire 75,000 is how we would do it without any safe note from any investor. And that would exclude paying salaries.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:51:45.492Z)

Yeah, it's. It's just the safe note is not. Special to that consulting agreement. It's just meant to be, right? The money is supposed to get paid to InnVestAI. And then we do with it what we will. Is consulting agreement that she crafted has nothing to do with anything. That we are talking about. Unfortunately volunteered to work for free, basically. So that's. That's the issue. The job description. I mean, there is job descriptions already in the LLC agreement. They are. You know, chat, GPT, job descriptions. So they require finessing and. I mean, ultimately, Diane is not doing these things. I mean, she's like, She's doing some of them or she's doing her best, and I, you know, I understand that. I don't know if. If Mark is going to. Like these job descriptions, right? Like I should say just Mark, I don't know of any of us are going to agree. Like this is going to be difficult to get us to agree to this. However, I do think it is important. If not job descriptions, we put ourselves in swim lanes. To some extent. Which currently we do not. You know, the LLC just says, We all weigh in on everybody else's, you know? Jobs. Basically. Which. I think. Is. Proving to be problematic. Possibly. So as I'm thinking out loud here, maybe we. Instead of job descriptions, we craft this as. Drew. Where did the last job description come from? Is that you who created it? I just did it from chatgpt said give me the basic, you know, standard job descriptions for these startup. So it's super generic. Gotcha. Gotcha. This might be something we can do. Very easily. Then a full on job description. I didn't explicitly get this with Mark, but I think my thought here is this can be done outside of the LLC agreement. Like this would just be. You know, we can each find an employment agreement. In order to receive compensation. Which can just say, you know, we're going to work. For FBI, you know, whatever. Similar to, like, a contractor agreement that we should have had our contractor signed that I was working on and never finished, but you should still try to finish and get, you know, but basically just something pretty standard. Mark said he's fine. And I'm fine as well. If we get paid back on our loan. After. Not from this raise, but from the next one. And I think you know Mark's vouching hour for you as well, right? Like any expenses you've incurred should also get reimbursed. I mean, I think for you it'll be out of this raise. It'll be done now. So this is, you know, we can put this into this business plan that I. The sources and uses funds that I put together. This can just go into. The llc agreement. Howard, I think your. Your point is valid. You know, like. Like, you know, not everybody can do this if we're, you know, meeting in person, but if it's, I think we can just say. There should be, you know, good faith effort. You know, like any. Any meetings that any of us have externally that are related to the business. Should, you know, we should at least mention to each other, you know, to each of us, which we have been doing a better job of recently. Like Diane mentioned, Mohari, which is a group she was meeting with just to discuss. Turns out they're a customer of mine. So, you know, that was relevant. You know, Mark brought up Access Point Financial, which is great because they're a customer I talk to. So, you know, we have been doing better in this, but we can put it into the LLC as. A, you know, part of our operating process. I did not put this in here originally because. I didn't think it was relevant, and it wasn't in the template for the LLC agreement. But Mark. Agrees. You know, Mark wanted this in here, which now that he pointed it out, I think Diane and I think. You guys have also said this is relevant, like we should. It's just. It's just be a super simple cookie cutter table. You know, we all invest over three years.

### You (2025-11-12T22:57:15.327Z)

Yeah. When I come to the end on Tuesday. She just briefly mentioned this. And she wants it. That's superior. I think she wants it to be 20% right out of the gate. So I don't remember who originally brought up. The vaccine.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:57:36.532Z)

She originally wanted the best thing.

### You (2025-11-12T22:57:37.967Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:57:38.052Z)

But then she tried.

### You (2025-11-12T22:57:39.967Z)

She added on that, so that's.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:57:40.932Z)

Yeah, I think she started to say that. Then it only applied. It didn't apply to her. That it only applied to everybody else.

### You (2025-11-12T22:57:49.007Z)

Sorry. To remember. That now. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T22:57:51.732Z)

That she was carved out, okay? I was not part of that. So why should we have wasting at all? Well. The point is that if any one of us leaves, For whatever reason, you know, good or bad. If we are fully vested. At the beginning right now. Then we take the 20% with us and. Nobody can do any. Like the company then can't do anything with that. So, like Benode, if you were to leave, if you were to get, you know, amazing million dollar job offer and you were like, gods. All right, I gotta take this. You know you would take your 20% with you. And we would have to go find another CTO, but we'd be 20% poor in order to do that. Unless you wanted to give us our 20. You know, give us the 20% back. So investing schedule would ensure that if, you know, same thing. If I get a job offer, that's, you know, if my company blows up and I'm like, guys, I can't do this anymore. I gotta focus on my own company. You know, if that happens in the first year or two before this company is making decent money and can pay everybody, you know, reasonable amount and has value, You know, then the vesting schedule ensures that if any one of us leaves, we can go find a replacement and use the equity that that person is leaving behind to do that. Got it. So till three years. If you live within that three year, you get nothing, right? No, I don't think you get nothing. I think you just. It would be, you know, 1/3. 1/3, 1/3. That's how I leave. In the first year, you get one third. If you leave in the second year, you get two thirds. If you leave the third year, you get all, you know. That's good. So I think that's fine with me. Mark. I mean, Howard. What do you think?

### You (2025-11-12T22:59:49.487Z)

No, I actually do confuse the exact same reasons. So, yeah, I think we just need to get clarification what she meant. If she was still just referring to herself when she went back on that. Or if she was thinking about. Making it for everyone.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:00:24.212Z)

Okay? Basic governments. I mean, this is in the agreement for the most part. You know, everything is done by. There's a handful of things that are done by supermajority.

### You (2025-11-12T23:00:29.407Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:00:33.892Z)

And everything else by majority. Nothing is done by consensus. Which means that no, basically, no one person can. Be a roadblock. If everybody else. Agrees on something.

### You (2025-11-12T23:00:48.287Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:00:48.532Z)

Which diane.

### You (2025-11-12T23:00:48.847Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:00:51.252Z)

I think. We had all said initially that we agreed to. I don't. There may have been changing stances on that. Diana may not feel the same way now, but that is something that I know that she. I mean, because that's why she brought us in. All those equal partners. That was in the initial agreement.

### You (2025-11-12T23:01:09.807Z)

Y. Eah. We can't. Have. Consensus. So we're fine. On that one.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:01:25.252Z)

So that the last one is. So, you know, Driftwood, what are their expectations and. I guess active capital partner. Meaning? Again, just going back to what is Driftwood. What are their expectations?

### You (2025-11-12T23:01:41.247Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:01:42.932Z)

I got the sense that Diane. And again, maybe she was just spitballing ideas, things that they could do with us. Not things that they expect. To do with us. It's hard to know, you know, which were which when she has been talking to these guys for a long time. And metal. You know, talk to their cto. And their whatever. Their VP of whatever. Like, she's been floating a lot of ideas by them, which is fine. On the one hand, however, we now have no idea what they expect.

### You (2025-11-12T23:02:16.607Z)

Y. Ep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:02:17.732Z)

And that's, you know, that's problematic. Not just for us as a company, but me and Mark in particular, because our names are affiliated with this. And for me, if I want to go, I mean, what's absolutely a target customer for my business, and if, you know, if this goes sideways or their expectations are not met, Hampers or ruins any chance of me getting them as a customer.

### You (2025-11-12T23:02:42.127Z)

Right, so.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:02:43.332Z)

Hey, Drew, I think Mark wants to be added to the call. With that. Mark wants to be added to the call. Oh, shit. Okay.

### You (2025-11-12T23:02:52.927Z)

That's fine, but I need to drop in about three minutes.

Yeah. What is. What is about Driftwood is that it doesn't mention anything in the safe node itself. But that doesn't mean that she hasn't verbally made any type of commitment, so I fully agree.

### Guest (2025-11-12T23:03:08.052Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T23:03:18.527Z)

Hey, Mark, it's Drew. Tonight you're on my phone when we're talking. I'm sorry. I thought you were driving, so I didn't try to loop you into this. We're on a teams call. Sorry. Howard Benoit. Can you guys hear? Me. Yeah, okay. So, Mark, we were just going through this literally, line by line. Of your comments. You know point one. Driftwood money gets deposited directly to a bank account that will be opened. So that's, you know, totally agreed to. I'm gonna skip number two. Which was about the. Actually, number two, like, I think this, this is. I think Howard needs to go. Howard, Anything you want to say or something?

No, no. I mean documents. So if you want to just review with Mark, that's fine. I have my phone with me, so he'll just pin me on tubes or send me a text. I can reply, but I just. I just have to drop the call.
