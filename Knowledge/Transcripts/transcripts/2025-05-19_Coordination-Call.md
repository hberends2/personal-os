all the deals are in draft phase. I haven't marked them active. Says zero active. Then it'll calculate the average return for all the deals. I kind of hard quoted that 8.5 in most of the deals, and that's probably why it is averaging out that way.

### You (2025-05-19T20:33:52.725Z)

in of the things in that space. Probably why it's happening outside where total properties are in the portfolio is fifteen.

in

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:36:58.452Z)

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:04.115Z)

fence is the form that

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:04.592Z)

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:19.415Z)

course

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:22.872Z)

details from the operating unit table? Because I'm assuming there is a table with all the operating unit attributes that I gave you. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:31.255Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:31.282Z)

Is that the right way to think of this?

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:32.625Z)

basically,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:33.192Z)

So it'll basically pull these different details based on our database structure.

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:40.615Z)

order

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:41.902Z)

So deal whatever information we, are basically showing. So this

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:43.175Z)

basically showing to this this I

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:46.452Z)

again, this yeah. I mean,

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:47.205Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:50.412Z)

we can change how this looks or what all we want to show here. But right now,

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:53.855Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:54.692Z)

this is what we have.

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:55.295Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:55.952Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:56.725Z)

just to

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:57.312Z)

And then I I guess if I'm just

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:58.155Z)

expand on

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:37:59.052Z)

to expand upon this,

### You (2025-05-19T20:37:59.165Z)

I But

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:03.042Z)

Like, like, I if I know Howard, correct me if I'm wrong, but Diane, Mark, I think, like, if you think about it in the background, there's, like just think of, like, an Excel table. With a list of all the operating units

### You (2025-05-19T20:38:14.915Z)

my other one. Know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:15.642Z)

in, you know, like, on one side and then, you know, in each row, there's a whole bunch of attributes You know? Brands, parent brand, key count, building date, whatever. Just, like, whatever the attributes are that we wanna add, Right. You know, I just included whatever was in our system to start with, but you could add you know, is it union, nonunion? Is it, you know, like, when was the renovated? As many attributes as you can consistently get your hands on. You know, we can add. Yep. Yeah. And then some of them can also be user entered.

### You (2025-05-19T20:38:45.235Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:45.842Z)

When we do this.

### You (2025-05-19T20:38:46.695Z)

that's

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:47.082Z)

But

### You (2025-05-19T20:38:47.415Z)

that's right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:47.812Z)

I think this just

### You (2025-05-19T20:38:47.965Z)

I think first

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:38:48.872Z)

that that's, like, the I think, like, the first in my mind, that's, like, the first sort of step of setting up a deal is, like, what are all those attributes that are relevant? Where where were those attributes? Where would you put those attributes? Well, there I'm just saying, like, in the background, there's a there's a table. All those attributes are listed, and this page is bringing those to the surface. Right. Right. How does it get to the table? So that is basically the data Drew is saying is in the database right now. We have everything in the database. We can decide we want to show on this this page. So this is just the first draft. And then, you know, as I get your feedback, as we get users you know, Howard also hasn't seen that this is we are doing it first time. So we can decide what all information we want

### You (2025-05-19T20:39:31.995Z)

we Vinod, do you go back to

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:39:35.912Z)

to show in the deal detail page.

### You (2025-05-19T20:39:37.085Z)

I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:39:37.602Z)

And this is for a specific deal? Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:39:40.645Z)

yeah. Go back to to the deals. So, Drew, to address what you are mentioning here, what we had in Red IQ this would be all of the deals that the investor is working on. Right? So whether that's I mean, they could be active. They could be inactive. What we had, what we may wanna consider is the user could select the columns they want to see in this view. Because there's way too many to get on the page. Right? Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:40:13.902Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:40:17.175Z)

you know, if if the parent company is important and they wanna see it on deal list, we can do that. You know, just we be scrolling horizontally a lot if they want I mean, they may want everything. They may just wanna do four or five columns on there. And then when you drill into it, like, if Vinod, if you go back to the radish seven, you know, that you can you can also have some details here. The question is, how many? And And how And

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:40:52.992Z)

And, Howard, what you're talking about though is that Vinod, can you jump back to that list again? This isn't the list of hotels that are in your

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:01.825Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:02.472Z)

portfolio per se. Right? In theory, this is the list of deals that you are

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:03.315Z)

Is that you are

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:07.412Z)

underwriting at this current moment in time. So I might be looking at three deals, and I'm really active and maybe

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:12.655Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:15.412Z)

two deals I underwrote a month ago, but they didn't go anywhere. So I kinda put them on the

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:19.935Z)

this is your headline.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:20.082Z)

backburn. Right? Like, this is your this is your pipeline.

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:20.965Z)

That's exactly yeah. That's exactly what this is.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:22.862Z)

Essentially. Right? Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:24.225Z)

So some of the fields we wanna add on here. So you've got status. Right? So you could have an active. You could have whatever status that that you use. You might want a due diligence date or a bid due date on here. I mean, there's all sorts of things that we can add to this particular deal list.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:41:44.752Z)

And

### You (2025-05-19T20:41:44.955Z)

But, yes, you're right. This this would typically this would only be the pipeline. This is not you know, for the asset management clients. Then then, yeah, they're gonna wanna keep their portfolio on here, but they're gonna wanna probably a different view than than the other. Probably, there there is no status

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:42:01.152Z)

Right. Yeah. Or the same the same view

### You (2025-05-19T20:42:04.675Z)

think Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:42:05.842Z)

isn't the same view but it would be a different filter. Like, you'd be filtered filtering the properties separately.

### You (2025-05-19T20:42:09.045Z)

Okay. Yeah. There we there would be a

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:42:12.422Z)

Perhaps. Right. I think an asset manager would love to see this, They, you know, they don't necessarily care as much what's in the pipeline. They wanna know of the 10 hotels that I own, show me this list with the current, you know, investment returns and

### You (2025-05-19T20:42:25.715Z)

So what we did in our IQ and what what what I think is very common is

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:42:26.452Z)

Right. But but sit

### You (2025-05-19T20:42:29.695Z)

up there by the create deal button or somewhere there, you'd have a you know, select your columns. Right? Then you'd have a list of every column that we have, and they can check the ones they want. And maybe drag them into a different order, if they want to see the status right after the deal name, they can do that. Or move it around. And then you can also create groups Right? So if you're an asset manager, you may wanna call a create an asset manager group because those are the deals that you own. Their status

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:42:57.842Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T20:42:59.505Z)

might be owned. Right? You can do all sorts of different things with it with it that way. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:43:03.862Z)

But initially, for the

### You (2025-05-19T20:43:03.995Z)

But it does sound like capital

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:43:07.332Z)

capital market I mean, for the for, like, the Red IQ and the underwriting and acquisition person and the debt and structured finance person. Just wanna be clear. Right? This can be an asset management. Function, but this also is it's like so this is my pipeline. Right, that I'm work this that that I'm working on. Right? Okay. Cool. And, I mean, yeah, we can modify either and this page can be, you know, editable. And we can add any column. And then, you know, we kind of move them around or but, you know, I mean, the that in fact, Howard, you reminded me

### You (2025-05-19T20:43:15.895Z)

function, but it's also it's like so this is my pipeline. Right? That I'm working on. Right? Okay. But, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:43:40.462Z)

of that good functionality wherein we could kind of add and remove column on, you know, of move them around. So we can, you know, I can add add that here as well. Got it. Eddie, can I just throw this out there? And because I know you guys have had discussions too. But I I and I don't know how far we're gonna go with the like, how far

### You (2025-05-19T20:43:55.665Z)

like, how far

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:43:58.832Z)

we need to get out there. Right? We need I I think we should be out there the week after

### You (2025-05-19T20:43:59.975Z)

We get after and, like, NYU and start quietly trying to talk to people

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:02.452Z)

NYU and start quietly trying to talk to people.

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:04.815Z)

get climate, get

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:06.672Z)

Get client get, like, user feedback and things like that.

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:06.835Z)

like, user feedback. And things like that. But any time if time to

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:11.612Z)

But if there is any time to modify this page just the way it looks, right, because all the data is there, Mark would be the best person to on the on the, like, pipeline to say, we don't wanna call it investment deals. Maybe we wanna call it pipeline, or or maybe Mark has a different word he wants to use here. He probably would be the best person to sit to to comment on

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:33.655Z)

since now all the

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:33.802Z)

if if we have time since now all the data is linked. If we have time to just make some visual changes to the layout

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:39.835Z)

to the layout. Yet to to reach out.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:43.252Z)

he'd be the best person in yep. To to look at that. Please

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:45.995Z)

Half

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:46.452Z)

send send send your feedback, and then, you know, we'll accommodate all all the those feedbacks here. And, Mark, are you okay with that? I don't mean to dump that on you, but yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:44:53.605Z)

Yeah. Okay. K. Alright. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:44:55.722Z)

Yeah. Okay. Let me just take this second. Hang on one you know? Drew, you I Oh, can you go I'm sorry. Can you go back to that page for one second? Just wanna think through it so I should think about it.

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:07.955Z)

Thank you.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:08.572Z)

Thanks. Vinod, what we gonna Oh, we are done here? Okay. Yeah. Alright. So what I was saying is

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:19.095Z)

Is

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:21.662Z)

you had a lot of feedback on this space. So if you could also send your imports I'll, you know, modify this space according according, then we can see that version as well.

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:29.165Z)

Yeah. My

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:31.212Z)

Yeah. My my, question so if if

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:31.585Z)

question So it's, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:35.202Z)

know, Mark is probably

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:37.085Z)

to do.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:37.652Z)

the type of user that's going to that would really use this sort of page. My my my questions and my interest is more of, like, thinking about or making sure I understand

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:49.525Z)

Interest

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:51.852Z)

like Yeah. What is market trend analysis? What

### You (2025-05-19T20:45:53.405Z)

what are you trying

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:45:54.872Z)

you know, what are the deal details? Where are they coming from to make sure that when Mark says he wants to see you know, a certain thing on the page, it is indeed the same thing from the data table that we're getting, if that makes sense. Mhmm. Right. That's great because that's the power of this, right, is the direct linkage of the data and that and and then when it comes down to it, that's that's really Yeah. The the true power of what we're creating here. Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:46:18.855Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:46:22.062Z)

Yes. So as far as the data validation and this these all calculation validation where where these are working correctly or not. So we'll basically have to sit back on the data or in Excel and see if this all is, working fine. We'll have to do that sort of test I haven't done that yet. This is you know, I'm kind of still putting these pieces together. Yeah. A lot of stakeholders. And it looks great, Vinod. I mean, it it's like it's like Yeah. Every week, it's like we see it

### You (2025-05-19T20:46:52.235Z)

More and more. So it's like

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:46:53.672Z)

come to life more and more, and it's so exciting. It really looks wonderful.

### You (2025-05-19T20:46:53.975Z)

It really Thank you. So, yeah,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:46:58.322Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-05-19T20:46:59.345Z)

the business big.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:00.692Z)

So, yeah, this is basically what we have on the deal. It is

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:02.945Z)

Do a sec.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:04.652Z)

I can send see, this is just running on my local. This is not running any on any so I can't really share the application. But I can send this screenshot to you. For, you know, all the pages we have, and then you can provide feedback on those.

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:15.655Z)

Yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:17.812Z)

So how do you how do you get to the data input

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:18.285Z)

put? Thank you. So maybe

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:20.912Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So we we go there. So

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:21.505Z)

go ahead. So so we teleport I already Yeah. So what?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:24.442Z)

we click on add it here. So what so from here, right, we kind of input all these details. So say, acquisition.

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:30.335Z)

These together.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:36.872Z)

Acquisition cost for whatever, say, percent. Shouldn't this be Probably, like, a million or don't This shouldn't be a percentage. Right? This should be, like, month or What does that mean? I don't know what acquisition cost means. I think that would be, like, the the asking price. So, you know, 10,000,000, 20,000,000, whatever. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:58.045Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:47:59.412Z)

Oh, okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:47:59.915Z)

Right. I think acquisition cost, if you go back to the model that you sent, Diane,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:01.422Z)

Purchase price. Right? Purchase price. Yeah. Price is a gift. Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:05.045Z)

Diane, that is your Yeah. Go ahead. Got it.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:08.372Z)

Oh, that's what got it.

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:09.035Z)

Yeah. Got it. Miscellaneous.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:11.402Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:13.665Z)

Got

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:13.832Z)

And so, like, Mark, this this might be something you wanna break out, right, to have a

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:14.635Z)

Got it. Print.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:18.072Z)

a purchase price and then a place for the fees that go along with it, like the

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:18.265Z)

For the fees. That go on a bit. Like, the 2% or whatever You're you're trying to calculate the purchase price.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:22.832Z)

2% or whatever it is. And then

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:25.275Z)

You mean that's that's what this model is for.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:25.552Z)

yeah. Well okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:27.875Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:29.462Z)

Yeah. But but I think typically,

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:29.795Z)

You know, they're there's gonna be an asking price.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:32.192Z)

you know, there there's gonna be an asking price I mean, I I guess you could back into it also. You go either way, but, typically, there is an asking price that the broker or the seller would would sort of assign to the

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:41.785Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:44.122Z)

transactions. That's something that that the acquisition

### You (2025-05-19T20:48:44.315Z)

Right. Sort of in mind.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:48:47.802Z)

analyst needs to keep in mind. So yeah. Bit so based on sorry. Go ahead, Diane. As I said, if you look on this guy, IRR, it's got where you are compared to your hurdles, got cap rate, cash on cash return. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:05.875Z)

That's pretty cool. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:08.502Z)

That's pretty cool. Yeah. I think yeah. That's those are the metrics I think we decided

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:11.835Z)

Setting.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:15.292Z)

so we'll have those. There. And then, you know, based on these values, these these data basically get updated. Suppose hold period is 20, then your returns would go down.

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:24.675Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:27.472Z)

So something like that. Five, then it'll go up.

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:33.375Z)

She's got

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:34.042Z)

Yeah. Three This is calculating off of a form a? Is that where is the net information coming from? Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:41.735Z)

that's it.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:42.062Z)

That's that's how it is getting emulated. I'll I'll have to double check, but yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:51.345Z)

It's a

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:51.702Z)

So yeah. I mean, this is

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:52.035Z)

a thing.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:49:54.442Z)

the exemption form, and I think this still needs to be modified, right, Howard. We

### You (2025-05-19T20:49:58.215Z)

More Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:00.612Z)

have more food and beverage and all that coming up. Right? So, Howard and Vinod, you're still in the process of taking those data ranges that you created in Excel and

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:13.425Z)

Pull them up into this. Got it. Yeah. And I'm not sure that's

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:15.842Z)

pulling them up into this. Got it. And that's I'm sure that's a miserable hard

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:16.785Z)

up. Is there a washer?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:20.602Z)

awful process. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:23.065Z)

Thing.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:23.822Z)

And this is gonna break. So yeah. So, yeah, I mean, as far as data input goes, so either you added the existing data that you have already added

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:33.945Z)

Or

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:36.242Z)

or when creating a deal, we are saying add assumptions. So if I go back

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:39.505Z)

deal see.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:43.112Z)

let's see. Create new deal. Remember, it's fair field. Let's see this.

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:50.135Z)

At this created,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:52.422Z)

At this point, when the deal is created, we can insert the data at that point.

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:52.745Z)

we can insert the data and track So at this stage,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:57.332Z)

So

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:57.435Z)

the user will basically

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:58.122Z)

and this stays

### You (2025-05-19T20:50:59.175Z)

input all this data

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:50:59.682Z)

the user will basically input all this data

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:04.535Z)

The So yeah. One thing is

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:09.012Z)

So yeah. When this is question. If it's, like,

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:09.755Z)

like, like, hypothetically saying, that

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:12.632Z)

like, hypothetically, say that in, like, in a year from now,

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:14.485Z)

now. That

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:17.512Z)

that the an owner taking an asset to market says, okay.

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:19.015Z)

taking it as

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:23.342Z)

HEI, send all this information to Invest AI. Digitally. Right? So we don't have to deal with all these Excel files and stuff like that.

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:29.855Z)

the key, then it comes in to a really good rest

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:31.392Z)

So if that's the case and it comes in through Drew into Invest AI,

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:33.145Z)

then it's all gets populated

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:35.632Z)

then this all gets populated into the

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:35.755Z)

into the historical component of the under

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:38.892Z)

historical component of the underwriting model.

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:39.875Z)

model. Right? Like, instantaneously.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:42.632Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:43.295Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:43.702Z)

instantaneously. I don't think the user would be able to send these data, though.

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:49.385Z)

What's that? They started the data.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:50.582Z)

Right, Howard? The historical data is there for sure, but this user has

### You (2025-05-19T20:51:51.755Z)

But they the history.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:51:55.712Z)

input unless we, kind of our AI is in place and AI is able to, you know, come up with some prepopulated fields and able to fill all these. For the pro form a part of it. Right? The historicals would get

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:07.355Z)

Store close would get populated.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:11.212Z)

populated, and then the analyst or whoever's underwriting this would have the ability

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:12.435Z)

Have the ability to change the pro form a of assumption.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:15.672Z)

to change the pro form a assumptions going forward.

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:16.275Z)

Going forward. Yes. Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:19.622Z)

Yes. Okay. So, yeah, this

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:21.085Z)

Yeah, this part is progress. So once this is completed, we'll

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:23.862Z)

part is in progress. So once this is completed, we'll

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:25.155Z)

basically

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:27.572Z)

be able to,

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:27.705Z)

to pull

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:29.952Z)

pull, push all that data into the model. But, we are discussing, like, how we should handle the model whether, you know, we want to give the user ability to the model and then work on it, but that diff defeats the purpose of our application wherein we want user to be able to use the application, not Excel.

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:50.865Z)

think through that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:50.932Z)

So probably we'll have to think through that.

### You (2025-05-19T20:52:56.615Z)

That So so

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:52:57.322Z)

I don't I don't understand where that I didn't follow so so we're we're not gonna user's not gonna have the ability to create their own model?

### You (2025-05-19T20:53:02.125Z)

No. No. We're what Vinod was mentioning is one of the things that was that we talked about offline were how how could we make it easier for the users to input the data? And one of the things mentioned is, well, maybe maybe they input this information into Excel, and then we upload it like we do others. But as he just mentioned, that's that's that's defeating the purpose. Because they would be basically creating the model in Excel. So why would they want to upload it here? So really the bottom line is our goal at the end of the day is to have all of the work done in our web app. Nothing gets done in Excel. In a perfect world. And it's gonna take a while to get there, But, essentially, what we're showing you here, and I've got something here I can I can show you as well that I've been working on today? The users would upload the data or we get it from HPIS. Whatever however we get the historical data. And then what they're going to do is they're going to go through these different pages, which are essentially different tabs in Excel. So so what you see along the left hand side would be just like an Excel model, tabs along the bottom. And so you could go to those pages like you would in Excel, input the information, and you see the effect of that change immediately. With the key performance metrics up there. And each page will also have information on it. You know, we'll have, like, the if if if there's something that you have to input for each year of the hold period, you can have 12 inputs going across the top. You can see everything, and I'll I'll kinda show you what I'm I'm working on here to that. But you know, Mark, at the end of the day, we wanna get all of this data within the app. Because Excel is a black hole. When we start pushing people into Excel, we lose control of the data. We don't get the data back. Therefore, we can't monetize the data. Right. But I I think it's Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:17.472Z)

Right. But I I mean, I guess the question that I have is is just you know, is it too much

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:22.325Z)

Too much to ask of all these people. To do change

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:25.212Z)

to ask an acquisitions people to do change everything that they do

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:26.915Z)

every that they do. Today. Instantly. Or for the

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:30.942Z)

today instantly or should there be a more gradual progression

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:33.665Z)

so people trust kinda freak out and say, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:35.982Z)

so that people don't just kind of freak out and say, you know,

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:37.545Z)

everything I'm doing.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:39.582Z)

everything I've known and done for the last

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:39.965Z)

You know? Ten years.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:42.202Z)

you know, ten years in the case of an acquisitions person. Is changing. I I just wonder whether this is

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:46.625Z)

Right? Question that ultimately we're gonna get here.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:47.632Z)

it's it's amazing. Right? And there's no question that ultimately we're gonna get here.

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:49.535Z)

But it should some kind of interim step so that it's not just

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:51.662Z)

But should there be some kind of interim steps so that it's not just

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:53.415Z)

radically different than whatever. Has done.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:55:55.652Z)

radically different than what everyone has done for their whole careers day one?

### You (2025-05-19T20:55:56.795Z)

Careers. Day one. I I have the

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:00.232Z)

I I don't have the answer. I'm just throwing it out there for discussion.

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:01.005Z)

Yeah. No. I I I understand what you're saying. And, yeah, we're not gonna be here on day one. This is where we want to be after a few versions. You know, we're Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:12.512Z)

Right. But Diane keeps saying, you know, Diane's trying to keep us to a timeline, which is which

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:13.755Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:16.342Z)

is great and very important. For us for her to do. But, like, what do we want version one I'm trying to understand, you know, when some date in June when we start

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:20.675Z)

But I'm trying to you know, what something we start test marketing? To some people?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:27.372Z)

test marketing this to some people,

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:27.415Z)

What what is the the product?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:29.472Z)

What is the product

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:29.535Z)

What is the look like? Like, this is

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:31.552Z)

What is v one gonna look like? Like, this to me, this seems like

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:32.825Z)

same like and it's very So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:36.012Z)

and it's great. So I'm I'm I'm just trying to be constructive, but this seems like v three or

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:36.465Z)

trying to construct this seems like me. 300 people. Four. Like, what

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:40.682Z)

v four.

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:40.925Z)

first? In the first version?

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:41.622Z)

Like, what what are we gonna do with the first in the first version?

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:43.275Z)

To get people excited

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:46.092Z)

To get people

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:47.425Z)

about this. And

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:48.332Z)

excited about this

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:49.225Z)

you know, try to have

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:50.562Z)

And, you know, do we wanna try to have version one work for acquisitions people

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:51.545Z)

Well, acquisition. People. Look etcetera.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:56:56.582Z)

asset managers, lenders, etcetera, or do we wanna just say version one is just

### You (2025-05-19T20:56:57.045Z)

Who want to say for people.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:01.252Z)

gonna be

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:01.695Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:01.962Z)

for acquisitions people so that we just narrow our focus and we

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:02.375Z)

just narrow focus we can really drill down. And make big one.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:06.062Z)

could really drill down and make v one as

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:07.585Z)

Yep. Good. Be big.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:10.112Z)

you know, good as it can be. Right? So I just

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:10.175Z)

They get

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:12.642Z)

again, I'm just reacting because I I you know, just giving some some my

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:15.585Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No. Fair enough.

### Guest (2025-05-19T20:57:16.562Z)

thinking out loud, if you will.

### You (2025-05-19T20:57:18.295Z)

Version one, yes. It will be primarily for the acquisitions. The the the analysts who would normally work within an Excel spreadsheet to come up with evaluation. Our goal is based on the spreadsheet that I was given for the template. Know, we wanna get that summary page. We wanna get the operating cash flow page, the cash flow summary. And in order to do that, we have to input assumptions penetration, food and beverage. There's a lot of detail that has to be put in that feeds those sheets to get to the overall valuation. So coming out of the gate, we're gonna have a lot of that information in there. Now some of the inputs are gonna be more at the summary level and not individual line item detail, and we can talk about that before. Or later. But what we need to do is we need to get something at least with enough flesh on it so that when you sit down and talk to somebody, you can show them this is what you input. And this is what you get out of the model. And then we can build additional features after that. Like, you know, going for the asset managers and bringing in data and automating things that we can do along the way. But in order to get to that POC, we we do have to build a lot of what you're seeing here today. And to address your other concern, yeah. You know, there are gonna be people that push back. And say, I like the model I got. Don't want to change. So what we need to do, we need to show how number one, this is gonna save them a lot of time. And it's going to be accurate because Excel has errors. Bottom line. There's there's a there's a certain marketing push that we're gonna have to go through in order to get the people to use it. And I equate that like, okay. Well, what if I was underwriting and I was employed by Diane and I'm using Diane's model, then Mark comes gives me a better offer, and I go to work for Mark, but work Mark has a different Excel model. No different here. It than if they were going to go somewhere else. And work for somebody else in the same industry, but they have a different Excel model. So there's no way we can make this look like everybody's model because everybody's model is different. So there will be a difference in how it looks but there won't be a difference in how it acts. The formula to calculate something is going to be the same. No matter where it is. So you put in the number, you generate the formula, this times this equals that. That's not gonna change. So everything else is there. It's just how it gets there. And and that's what we're really focusing on right now is it's got to be super simple, for any analysts to go in here and say, oh, yeah. That's that's where I put in my food and beverage. That's where I put in my occupancy. I type it in, and you immediately see the information there. It saved. They don't have to worry about saving the information. It can be changed. I mean, you can you can share it with teams. So there's an awful lot of benefits that can be done, and and this will save them a tremendous amount of time. So that's that's really we saw. Is.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:00.682Z)

I ask a question? Like, so say, hypothetically, if we were used the the summer, and we were to go out and we were to talk to, like, Mark's professional analyst, and we were to talk to Drew, you know, Drew's

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:09.445Z)

You know, Drew's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:12.522Z)

Starwood Capital, their acquisition analyst. And we were to

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:12.635Z)

And we were at instead of, like, a whole a weird self

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:16.382Z)

instead of, like, a hard sell on this, we were to say, look. This is the proof of concept.

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:16.405Z)

we were sailing. Concept We're getting we're collecting

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:21.232Z)

We're getting we're collecting customer feedback right now.

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:21.285Z)

customer feedback right now. So let's take your model and

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:25.782Z)

So let's take your Excel model and, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:26.635Z)

show what you do right when we have submitted.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:28.922Z)

show us what you're doing right and what the outcome is. And then let's

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:29.515Z)

Then then let's see how it takes to do this and invest AI. I'm trying

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:32.602Z)

then let's see how long it takes to do this in InvestAI, how much more complicated it is

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:33.835Z)

more complicated. If we're

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:37.572Z)

for you. And

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:37.975Z)

react is that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:39.492Z)

if what Mark's reaction is they're just gonna roll their eyes and be like, no. This is too much

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:40.165Z)

and be like, no. This is too much for me right now. Right? Is there

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:44.102Z)

for me right now. Right? Is there a bridge that could exist

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:45.505Z)

exist for a period? Called, like, a

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:48.412Z)

for a interim period, call it a

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:51.655Z)

Right? So that we can

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:51.972Z)

twelve month period, right, so that we could

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:52.635Z)

start to get actual revenue. Through the door.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:55.082Z)

start to get actual revenue through the door.

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:55.965Z)

And then people

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:01:58.282Z)

And then as people become more comfortable that the online model

### You (2025-05-19T21:01:58.865Z)

that the model can. Replace Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:03.042Z)

can replace Excel that we

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:03.085Z)

That we sold start to move people off of Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:06.242Z)

slowly start to move people off of Excel. May and maybe it's a price

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:07.905Z)

A pricing strategy that goes in or some other thing

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:10.702Z)

strategy that does it or some other thing. But in in your mind, is there a way that over and maybe a year isn't the right interim. You know, maybe it's until December of of this year. But I I think

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:21.295Z)

year. But I think it's probably gonna take us a solid twelve months to penetrate

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:26.172Z)

it's probably gonna take us a solid twelve months to penetrate the hospitality industry with with this.

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:28.135Z)

the hospitality industry with with this. You know, from a a demo and a customer feedback and acquisition perspective.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:32.902Z)

You know, from a a demo and a customer feedback and acquisition

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:36.635Z)

I I labeled there, but is there

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:37.872Z)

So I I rambled there, but is there a way that we can, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:38.985Z)

that we can, like, almost have that excel

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:42.842Z)

almost have that weaning of Excel as as part of

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:43.325Z)

as part of our process with them. We we can certainly

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:47.012Z)

our process with them.

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:49.885Z)

those

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:50.242Z)

We I mean, we can certainly go

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:50.305Z)

two x number of ownership groups, acquisition

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:52.772Z)

to x number of

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:54.635Z)

teams, and say, here's what we have.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:55.312Z)

ownership groups, acquisitions teams, and say, here's what we have.

### You (2025-05-19T21:02:56.355Z)

And here's what we're thinking. You know, give us your feedback.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:02:58.812Z)

And here's what we're thinking.

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:00.125Z)

If some of the feedback is

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:01.222Z)

Know, give us your feedback.

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:02.335Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:02.762Z)

If some of the feedback is

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:04.865Z)

we for

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:05.622Z)

you know, we prefer Excel,

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:05.645Z)

Excel. Then I think that ideally, that's an opportunity for us to

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:08.642Z)

then I think that ideally, that's an opportunity for us to

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:10.815Z)

you know, talk to to Nick understand why.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:13.402Z)

you know, talk to to dig in, to understand why.

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:14.555Z)

Like what they're doing in Excel that we're not doing in the online interface.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:17.052Z)

Like, what is it that they're doing in Excel that we're not doing in the online interface?

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:18.645Z)

Okay. But I think, yeah, I think you're good too. Too logical.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:21.232Z)

But but but I think, yeah, I think you're being too

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:22.335Z)

It's not that they like the or

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:23.392Z)

too logical. It's not that they like

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:24.635Z)

don't like Excel. It's just what they're used to.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:26.472Z)

or don't like Excel. It's just what they're used to.

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:26.685Z)

And know, if you're asking someone to change everything

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:29.152Z)

And, you know, if you're asking someone to change everything that they've done,

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:30.205Z)

that they done, I just don't know if people are going to do that. Day one or or if it takes

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:33.512Z)

I just don't know if people are willing to do that day one or or or if it takes

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:36.135Z)

you know, if you look at self driving cars or, you know, look at whatever

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:38.092Z)

you know, I mean, look at self driving cars or, you know, look at

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:39.275Z)

new technology there is. Right? It's it's a graphical progression in terms of people getting comfortable

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:41.202Z)

whatever new technology there is. Right? It's just it's a gradual progression in terms of people getting comfortable

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:43.945Z)

new technology. And there's no question this is the future. Mean, there's no question this is amazing.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:46.032Z)

with new technology. And and there's no question this is the future. And there's no question this is amazing.

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:49.565Z)

But people are just creatures of habit and

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:51.952Z)

But people are just

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:53.075Z)

Yeah. You know, I get that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:54.022Z)

creatures of habit. And Yeah. You know, I get that, you know,

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:54.205Z)

you know, younger people may be more have to try think.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:03:57.042Z)

younger people may be more apt to try new things, but

### You (2025-05-19T21:03:57.225Z)

But I just don't know if they're be willing. I I don't have the I don't have

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:00.142Z)

yeah, I just don't know if they're gonna be willing and I I don't have the I don't have the again, I'm

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:00.895Z)

the account. Mean,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:03.882Z)

not my I'm just reacting initially. Like, I just when you ask someone to change everything that they're comfortable doing,

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:07.215Z)

overnight, then generally speaking, makes people uncomfortable.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:09.832Z)

overnight, that generally speaking makes people uncomfortable.

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:12.335Z)

All. So that certainly, if you

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:13.462Z)

Yeah. That's that's true. From the from a if you I mean, there's two sort of on the average side, there's gonna be, like, a senior you know, more senior people that are looking across

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:18.695Z)

you know, of a portfolio

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:23.502Z)

a a portfolio of of investment opportunities.

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:25.125Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:27.632Z)

Reviewing things, and there's the analysts that are gonna be

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:29.095Z)

work.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:30.372Z)

doing the legwork, entering the information, you know, tweaking the assumptions. Are you thinking of one group over the other more so in in your in that comment?

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:39.475Z)

The kids

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:39.492Z)

Yeah. I I think that we have to win over

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:41.665Z)

the scene

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:41.812Z)

the kids.

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:42.375Z)

are gonna say, oh, sounds interesting. They gotta go out there and say, what do you think of this?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:43.652Z)

Know, the the senior people are gonna say, oh, sounds interesting. They're gonna go to their analyst thing

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:47.005Z)

And you know, I think the senior

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:47.812Z)

say, what do you think of this? And, you know, I I think the senior people are gonna force

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:49.155Z)

people can force the senior people to to use this. I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:52.692Z)

the junior people to

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:53.215Z)

we're we're gonna have to

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:54.202Z)

to use this. I think we're they we're gonna have to

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:54.245Z)

hit the We're gonna have to do this

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:04:56.852Z)

hit them at multiple level. We're gonna have to introduce this at multiple levels, but ultimately,

### You (2025-05-19T21:04:57.405Z)

multiple levels. But ultimately, have to get to twenty thirty year olds to think this is the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:01.522Z)

we have to get the 20 and 30 year olds to think this is the greatest thing. And I just don't know

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:02.195Z)

thing, and I just don't know. Honestly, I I'm just you know, I know what

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:06.162Z)

Honestly, I I'm just

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:06.455Z)

they'll be willing to change overnight.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:07.662Z)

I don't know whether they'll be willing to change overnight.

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:07.965Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:10.592Z)

From our like, so looking at our own sales process customer base, the thing that we did is as you said, really target the analysts

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:18.755Z)

And that that was what

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:21.502Z)

because that that was what kind of I was doing and where I saw the need. And it it definitely was like, not like, it was it it tended to be more the executives that are, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:34.575Z)

You know, they

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:37.422Z)

you know, that they're making the decisions and and didn't see as much of the value in what we were doing. Because they're like, well, we just have analysts do this.

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:42.695Z)

I I just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:44.062Z)

So,

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:45.095Z)

I and I agree

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:45.542Z)

I I guess what I'm getting at is I mean, I agree. I think you gotta you gotta

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:48.955Z)

of people.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:50.182Z)

target both groups of people. I guess what I'm asking so, like, is what you see here, if you're wearing your executive, you know,

### You (2025-05-19T21:05:57.905Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:05:58.332Z)

team leader hat, it is this interesting to you to get you to you know, move ahead. Right? Assuming you're let's just forget what your analysts say for the time. And let's say they were, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:09.285Z)

open to it. We did see a

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:10.522Z)

let you know, they're, like, you know, open to it. Would this be enough to

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:12.145Z)

talk.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:13.962Z)

a from your executive point of view, enough to to gauge your gauge your interest?

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:15.955Z)

To be clear, that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:17.132Z)

Yeah. And, again, just to be clear, I'm I'm trying to remove myself

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:17.345Z)

myself personally,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:20.242Z)

personally. I just put myself in those shoes of a user, so this is not like

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:21.595Z)

I'm just trying to just give feedback here and be helpful.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:24.312Z)

just trying to

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:24.435Z)

So still

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:25.212Z)

just give feedback here. It'd be helpful. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:25.735Z)

it may not person

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:27.022Z)

So I I just don't know if if a young person

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:27.075Z)

is gonna have to current

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:29.792Z)

is gonna have the courage

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:29.805Z)

to just trust

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:32.502Z)

to just

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:33.135Z)

in their way. Doing something. Right? Because if for some reason,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:34.342Z)

trust the new way of doing something. Right? Because if for some reason,

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:36.075Z)

you know, this says it's not your heart 12 and a half, then it's really,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:38.382Z)

you know, this says it's an IRR of 12 and a half and it's really

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:39.615Z)

you know, 10 and a half right that that almost is gonna

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:42.422Z)

you know, 10 and a half. Right? That that analyst is gonna

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:43.365Z)

you know, get five or so. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:45.902Z)

you know, get fired. So I I don't know. I'm being overly dramatic, but

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:46.865Z)

but I I just have the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:50.032Z)

I just

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:50.145Z)

I'm just saying

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:50.882Z)

again, I I don't have the answer. I'm just saying, will people be willing to just

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:51.035Z)

people be willing to just change the way? They do this? Business overnight? Or is

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:54.652Z)

change the way they do business overnight

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:55.655Z)

there a rep? Progression? I just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:06:56.942Z)

or is there a gradual progression? I just

### You (2025-05-19T21:06:57.845Z)

think I'm throwing up Yeah. No. You you bring up a very valid point.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:07:00.442Z)

again, I'm just throwing it out there for our discuss

### You (2025-05-19T21:07:02.815Z)

I'm not trying to discount it. But there are multiple ways to to work with it. So first off, rather than Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:07:14.582Z)

But just to be clear, I this is great. Right? Like, I'm not I'm not

### You (2025-05-19T21:07:15.175Z)

Rather

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:07:17.602Z)

trying to be now, like, ultimately, this is gonna prevail. I have no doubt.

### You (2025-05-19T21:07:19.255Z)

from here to where we

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:07:20.762Z)

Just how do we get from here to where we will ultimately wanna be is my question.

### You (2025-05-19T21:07:21.405Z)

Great question. Yeah. So during the rollout, during the introductory period, what we wanna do is the the things that are really gonna win them over are let them go ahead and use both. Put together your Excel model. And then do the same thing in our model and, you know, if you are concerned about the numbers tying, let's take a look at it. If they don't tie, I mean, we certainly want know. Right? I mean, if if there's a problem in the model, we we absolutely want that. But there again, they may find there's a problem in their model. Somebody may have changed the formula. They weren't aware of it. Right? So that is extremely valuable process to have them do that side by side testing. Where we're gonna gain traction, number one, is client client testimonials. So when we start working with people, we absolutely wanna encourage them to give us client testimonials whether it's incentivized or or not. You know, as soon as I see somebody else taking advantage of it, then that kind of breaks good because, you know, there's always your pioneers, and there's always your Right? So we gotta hit the pioneers, let them start testing it out. And then the another thing that's gonna happen is people are gonna start losing out on deals to people using this tool because if we do it right, they will get to their number much faster than the other process. So if somebody starts putting in a deal a week before they can even finish their process, because of the time savings that we can provide. That's gonna force them. I mean, they they, you know, gotta keep up. So, so so your analogy, like, you know, with the self driving cars, I mean, that that's that's absolutely correct. I mean, everybody could be doing great, but nobody's out there buying it yet because nobody's proven that, you know, the self driving cars are faster, cheaper, and more exciting because that's what people love to drive. Right? So those are just a few ideas But, again, I I'm not a salesperson. You know? Maybe we need somebody in sales and marketing to to help consult. You know? It's like, how do we break down these walls? What what are we gonna do to overcome these objections? So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:09:53.232Z)

Howard, you're saying there there is the one could use an Excel model to write, like, with the named range that you put into the template that Diane provided. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:03.835Z)

One could use that model

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:10:06.752Z)

one could use those that model and with the named ranges uploaded.

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:10.735Z)

No. No. We we could.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:10:11.022Z)

To the system. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:16.485Z)

That that's the thing Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:10:20.322Z)

It defeats the purpose. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:20.515Z)

So what what we would have to do is we would have to have a template model. That we know to go into Excel, and we say, okay. This cell in this worksheet is the same as this in our database. Go in there, extract it, and put it in our database. If they use that, that's fine. But the problem is it it goes back to Mark's original objection, is like, it's not gonna be their model. It's not gonna be what they're used to. So so what what I'm saying is

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:10:50.882Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:50.895Z)

do a side by side. Do a taste test. Right? Pepsi, Coke. Which one do you like best? And what are they? Part of both. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:10:58.172Z)

I mean, we could you could do something

### You (2025-05-19T21:10:59.135Z)

About

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:00.302Z)

I I know this is a expensive time consuming proposition.

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:02.195Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:03.812Z)

Got Coke here. It could be for the first couple of customers, or, you know, testers, we could set it up with you could end you could take their existing model, like, Mark's Mark's TPG model, and you could make add the same named ranges. I mean, that would be a somebody would have to do that. Hopefully, not Howard, but, you know, you'd hire somebody

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:24.655Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:27.242Z)

offshore to do that, to do the named ranges, and then you they could use their existing model And for the first couple of customers to get to get traction, that might be a way around

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:36.935Z)

That

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:37.372Z)

and that, you know, somebody's hesitation of, like, well, I'm reluctant to leave my model for this new product that no one's ever used before. That might be one way around it.

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:46.455Z)

That that would.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:47.772Z)

At least initially.

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:48.835Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:50.992Z)

Uploading it Yeah. Uploading it to the system, seeing it populate IRR and all this stuff.

### You (2025-05-19T21:11:52.325Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:11:56.242Z)

You know? And then providing the testimonials that we need. Right? Or right? So mean, that's unfortunately, like, that that adds extra cost for for us because somebody has to do that. Yeah. And then the other thing is so sorry. The other thing is we'll lose on the modifications

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:12.935Z)

Details.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:16.092Z)

they make in the axle. If they're modifying something in our platform, we have that data. If they do anything in Excel, we are not syncing back from that. So

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:24.145Z)

Some of you how how

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:26.052Z)

Yeah. You you lose some So how are how are we inputting daily? If if I have five years of historical,

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:30.525Z)

date

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:30.602Z)

for a hotel,

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:31.055Z)

get here?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:31.682Z)

how does that data get in here? Well, sounds good to say maybe maybe show us if you're if you have it built out Howard, Vinod. Like, can you show us can you keep taking us through some of the pages as you as a user a user would enter assumptions, or is it not built out to that point yet?

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:46.685Z)

Right now, it's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:47.002Z)

Right now, it's

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:47.935Z)

closed. Going to, like, March.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:50.472Z)

kinda not going to like, not saving the data.

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:50.695Z)

So it's kind of in

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:53.422Z)

So

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:53.615Z)

the process. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:54.732Z)

it's it's kind of in the process. But the financial part that

### You (2025-05-19T21:12:55.925Z)

part that Michael was saying. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:12:59.952Z)

Mark was saying so that will come from either Drew or that will come through the user by uploading the files. So they upload their financial files on our system. We extract that information. It

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:08.835Z)

extract. Information

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:12.672Z)

on database. And we get it on the application. Can you show us can you go back to can you go to, like, operating revenue? That that tab and show us

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:21.925Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:21.982Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:24.275Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:25.302Z)

So I'm

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:25.325Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:28.022Z)

yeah. I mean, you can definitely add these assumptions.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:30.255Z)

I So what's that? Let's clarify so everybody knows that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:32.282Z)

Right? So But yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:34.325Z)

what the note is showing right now is strictly pro form a.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:34.502Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:38.805Z)

It's not historical.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:41.122Z)

Yeah. That's fine.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:42.085Z)

So so So that was definitely

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:43.242Z)

It's nice. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:44.375Z)

Yeah. Like typically, like,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:44.892Z)

So how would you adjust, here, like, typically, like, with food and beverage revenue,

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:45.575Z)

with right, you want to increase each year. So it's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:49.592Z)

right, you wanted to increase each year. So is this

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:50.465Z)

this just the, like, onetime percentage?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:13:53.242Z)

just the, like, a one time percentage, or can you adjust it by year?

### You (2025-05-19T21:13:53.525Z)

Here? I'd let let me when when we're done here, I'll show you that the this was just a version zero point zero Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:03.212Z)

Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:03.565Z)

Example of how we could go through a process. Yeah. None of these fields other than the property, the the property description fields. None of the other ones really are I mean, they they could be used, So so there are certain inputs that you just input once. Then there's other inputs that you wanna input by year. So we that's what we're gonna have to differentiate here. So since we put this together, I came up with another

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:35.312Z)

I mean, I was I was just having

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:35.935Z)

idea that I wanna show. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:40.892Z)

So we can go to that from But to that point, I mean, I would suggest, like, when we have inputs, like, it should be

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:45.245Z)

adjust typically you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:47.802Z)

adjustable by year because, typically,

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:48.565Z)

we're probably in acquisition acquisition for play.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:50.032Z)

you know, if we're looking at acquisitions, we're playing with

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:50.225Z)

With. You know, ramp up, ramp down,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:53.142Z)

you know, ramp up, ramp down. Maybe we close a venue for a year. Maybe we open it slowly. So there's a lot of

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:58.305Z)

cooking that right away.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:14:59.082Z)

it's not really just sort of

### You (2025-05-19T21:14:59.785Z)

Typically. Each year,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:15:01.282Z)

cookie cutter. Right? I mean, typically, each year,

### You (2025-05-19T21:15:02.165Z)

a sauce. Assumptions over ten year. Period.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:15:03.782Z)

may have its own assumptions over a ten year period.

### You (2025-05-19T21:15:04.025Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:15:07.522Z)

It's just as a FYI.

### You (2025-05-19T21:15:07.955Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:15:09.712Z)

Yeah. So how I think what would be useful is once we are kind of completed creating those forms, we could share those screenshots with everyone. That, you know, they understand that we have got capture

### You (2025-05-19T21:15:20.855Z)

three point. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:15:22.942Z)

the required fields. Yeah. Then kind of start putting that there. Howard, Vinod, real quick. The other thing I was gonna ask you, do you anticipate or, like, do you envision that user would be able to see historical data like, on this input form where you're inputting your future projections will be historical data for the same you know, metrics be shown somewhere right, so that I know you know, operated other operated revenue PLR was, you know, $25 last year, $24 the year before, $28 the before. Right? So I can see that history. Right? And I know, okay. Based on my investment thesis, this is what it's gonna be next year, the next year, the next year. Right? But you have the history visible in order to do that.

### You (2025-05-19T21:16:14.255Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:16:15.042Z)

Yeah. We can we can do that if you know, the user require it. Yeah. No. I think it's I think it's a very good point. I think that's people are gonna wanna see that. Yeah. Because there's one of the things. So, like, the if you looked at go back to the assumptions tab that Diane had. Right? Like, it had the historical view on there.

### You (2025-05-19T21:16:31.315Z)

Just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:16:31.862Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T21:16:32.235Z)

not just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:16:32.892Z)

Right? And that's just because hospitality all these assumption metrics are so volatile from year to year. It's not it's different than multifamily. It's not gonna it's not gonna be, like, whatever what it was yeah. It's like it it could change wildly, like, this, you know, this these metrics could change wildly from what they were last year. And and there's no you know, what what I mean, while there are, like, industry standards to a certain extent. Right? Like, it's gonna depend heavily from deal deal. So it's really important to look at the history, and then be able to apply that

### You (2025-05-19T21:17:06.045Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:17:07.552Z)

to the to the future. Yeah. And Drew's point is a really good one, especially now more than ever. People are looking at, like, pre COVID, during COVID, and post COVID as a benchmark

### You (2025-05-19T21:17:13.675Z)

A bit. For projecting

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:17:17.222Z)

for projecting the future. So there there's more of a focus now on historical than there probably has been in the past. Tell me. We can show that information for sure.

### You (2025-05-19T21:17:26.125Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:17:27.742Z)

Okay. Yeah. That would be I think that would be a good point. I think that would also ease the users Like Yeah. Yeah. The users' hesitation. Of, like, that they're used to seeing historical and like, that's what they're used to seeing. So if we as long as we keep you know, kind of keep what we're showing somewhat similar to what they're used to seeing, I think it'll reduce resistance

### You (2025-05-19T21:17:46.555Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:17:50.052Z)

too. Yeah. I mean, this is I mean, these are great inputs, and then, you know, we we have to make these things easier for the user, and that's the only way to, you know, kind of survive in the market and to

### You (2025-05-19T21:18:01.155Z)

Yeah. That's this page that you're

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:18:02.332Z)

do better than other competitors.

### You (2025-05-19T21:18:04.625Z)

showing right now is a is a good example of that. So when you're sharing the screen like this, it's hard to kinda get a an idea of how much room is on the screen. But those those metric are actually quite large. And so, you know, if if you wanna think about it, you also have, you know, maybe right below them, a row with your twenty nineteen, twenty twenty, 21, with all those same metrics and then going forward as well. They would be much smaller columns, if we need to make more real estate, you know, that that that left navigation pane, it's quite common to have it collapse down and then expand out. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:18:45.022Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:18:47.105Z)

having trouble with do viewing it. So to have a yearly metric

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:18:48.902Z)

Yes. We

### You (2025-05-19T21:18:51.265Z)

going along there is not a problem at all. That would be yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:18:56.012Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's why we are doing this session that, you know, we get good feedback, and we can incorporate I'll do just to be clear, I think people are gonna wanna see the full

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:05.995Z)

Historical budget, the historic

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:08.762Z)

historical budget and historic historical performance, so they're gonna wanna see line by line

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:08.795Z)

performance. I think I wanna see why my line know, over the food revenue line, expense.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:13.592Z)

you know, what was the food and beverage revenue? What was the food and beverage expense? What was the AG? What was the sales and marketing? What was

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:13.755Z)

Mostly sales marketing summary. Performance metrics.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:18.562Z)

right? So they're want us not to see the summary

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:19.455Z)

But they wanna see the actual line after

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:21.052Z)

performance matrix,

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:21.385Z)

from the financial statement.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:22.272Z)

they're gonna wanna see the actual line items from the financial statement.

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:22.885Z)

Yep. Yep. Every every day different metric on here. So if he clicked on, for example, food and beverage,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:25.632Z)

Yeah. And let when when

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:29.385Z)

you could have all your food and beverage information there. As well as being able to export the historical information for the, you know, if they want to see it, and we could display the full, p and l on here. I mean, the sky's the limit, really, with what we can put in here. I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:49.182Z)

I mean, whatever you

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:50.665Z)

mean, have this time, and that's always

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:52.802Z)

useful to the user

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:54.225Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:54.332Z)

at this time, I think that's what we should show.

### You (2025-05-19T21:19:55.925Z)

You know what? What?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:19:58.532Z)

You know, when we demoed that one wall type family AVM, one thing I thought was really interesting is they used the very right I don't know what you call it. Oh, yeah. Okay. Of the screen. Right? Oh, I'm on am I on mute? No. Okay. No. No. No. You're good. The very fourth of the screen to show, like, real time impact to the model to assumption changes. And I thought that was, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:18.985Z)

But I'm like, really great great. That's what you're doing in a

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:22.842Z)

really great great because that's what you're doing in a model. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:24.115Z)

to and

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:25.982Z)

you're trying to and and I know I'm very I'm a bit partial to the inputs

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:29.235Z)

inputs page that I sent to you guys because I really like

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:32.602Z)

page that I sent to you guys because I really like the way that it takes

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:32.735Z)

way that it takes the future projections and pulls up more. Back on that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:36.282Z)

the future projections and pulls it right back onto that

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:36.575Z)

Page. And it. So you

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:39.222Z)

that page and deflates it. So you can just kind of see, like, okay. If I'm making this kind of

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:39.835Z)

see, like, okay. My is kind of change, change. To my year two or year

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:44.162Z)

change, it makes this change to my year two or year three revenue.

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:45.585Z)

And then on on

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:48.442Z)

And then if on the on the quarter side, you could okay. Now that changes my IRR by

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:51.785Z)

okay, know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:20:54.682Z)

you know, it takes my IRR from a ten five an eleven two or something like that. It just it because that's the thing with an

### You (2025-05-19T21:20:55.915Z)

two or something like that. Because that's the the Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:02.942Z)

when you guys know this because, Howard, it's really not really that different than multifamily. It's all the flipping around in a model that you have to do. Right? That that's another part of what takes so much

### You (2025-05-19T21:21:12.675Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:12.702Z)

time. So Yeah. Right. Yeah. I think first step to this is finalizing the

### You (2025-05-19T21:21:17.825Z)

Information required.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:19.242Z)

steps and what all inputs we require in these. And you know, that's taken is, like, getting all the details for these tabs. And then after, you know, we are able to submit this

### You (2025-05-19T21:21:28.875Z)

This.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:32.142Z)

in database, then we can kind of, connect all this data into database. We could play different reports and all that.

### You (2025-05-19T21:21:38.595Z)

Yeah. And Diane, what we're describing is essentially what we've got at the top of the page here. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:42.572Z)

Got it. And and I wanted Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-05-19T21:21:45.275Z)

just going down the right. We're putting on the top. But, I mean, we can we can rearrange it anyway.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:21:51.122Z)

Ex It was great on the top too. I don't know why I liked it so much on the I I mean, maybe. I don't know why I liked it so much on the right. I just kinda felt like it was just, a constant, you know, check over to the right to see, like, how am I how are my inputs changing. But but you know what? That might be something that we want real user feedback on too. Right? Sell the kids. I think that that's gonna be our motto, Mark. We gotta sell the kids. On this, but

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:18.665Z)

Between the four kinds

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:19.922Z)

so so there may be change between the proof of concept

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:20.235Z)

So version we take to market.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:23.122Z)

and what ultimately ends up as

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:24.605Z)

Yeah. That I mean, that that's really important that everybody needs to

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:25.562Z)

the version we take to market.

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:28.495Z)

We can sit here and debate all day long how we like it, and we may be the only five that like it that way. Everybody else

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:32.192Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:35.285Z)

I want something different. Right? No. I want my and they want it on the bottom of the page. We haven't even talked about

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:40.962Z)

That's true. Totally true.

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:42.305Z)

that. Right? So that's what it's gonna come down to is is

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:46.432Z)

That's totally true.

### You (2025-05-19T21:22:47.615Z)

putting it in front of clients and and letting them decide how it works best for them.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:22:48.612Z)

Well, And and then if I could just say one thing on the sales process because I know that Mark said this, and he said it really well. It's like when we approach approach the sales strategy, it's almost like we're gonna have to have a tiered approach. We're gonna have to get the analyst on board first really like it and try to present it.

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:08.755Z)

Mhmm. Senior team

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:14.092Z)

But the senior team, Drew, you said you've had challenges trying to sell the the person who's gonna write the check. Right? Because they're like, well, we have analysts to do this.

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:21.795Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:22.762Z)

And the two things is, one, as Howard said, this can scale your organization and you can get there faster.

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:28.235Z)

But also, if you talk

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:30.842Z)

But, also,

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:31.255Z)

CEO, deal path forward,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:32.142Z)

if you talk to like, I heard the CEO of DealPath wants think he was speaking on I don't know if it was blueprints stage or one of the stages. Nirvana for a real estate investor is to be able to have all of the deals and

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:45.165Z)

be able to have all of the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:50.542Z)

all of the data that you're looking at overlaid to your portfolio. And he's like, that's hit that in

### You (2025-05-19T21:23:54.065Z)

like that full term.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:23:57.642Z)

he that was in a direct quote from him. Right? And so for, like, the

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:00.025Z)

They know

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:01.292Z)

senior senior folks, they now have to consider, alright. I have to somehow aggregate all of my data if I to be able to use AI two years from now.

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:01.395Z)

consider, alright, I have to all of my data in I want to be able to apply to from now. So how am I gonna actually going to do that? Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:11.822Z)

So how am I actually going to do that

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:13.575Z)

Is solution. For that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:15.472Z)

Right? And this is the solution for them to be able to do that.

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:15.905Z)

To be able to do that. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:22.172Z)

Yes. Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:23.185Z)

Something that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:23.402Z)

Yeah. And my point about

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:24.195Z)

that out.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:26.142Z)

selling the

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:27.105Z)

Lot of

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:27.112Z)

the it was basically that

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:27.535Z)

dashboard.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:28.582Z)

like, we don't have a lot of

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:29.985Z)

Like ours.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:30.392Z)

dashboards or standard reports. Like, ours is a like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:34.485Z)

Bye.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:35.472Z)

you can do anything with it. Which is on the one hand great, but that also means that somebody has to do that. Somebody has to go, like, do this, like, build the dashboards, build the reports, which we are which we do in some cases, but

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:49.345Z)

Or you know, they're like, look.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:50.012Z)

a lot of

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:50.685Z)

You know, I just want

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:51.322Z)

the executives were you know, they're like, well,

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:53.295Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:53.572Z)

you know, I just want

### You (2025-05-19T21:24:54.155Z)

really impressive dashboard.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:24:54.912Z)

like, some really impressive dashboard or this or that. You know? Whether or not they actually end up using it. Down the road if they become a customer is a separate you know, separate question. But, you know, from a sales perspective, having

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:06.605Z)

Look that's more polished.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:08.752Z)

dashboards that look really clean and professional and polished,

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:08.855Z)

Really

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:11.912Z)

really

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:11.965Z)

season. On and get

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:12.752Z)

turns executives like the the c suite people on and gets you know, gets a lot of buy in. I think that there's also buy in required at the analyst level, obviously.

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:13.515Z)

you know, get a lot of money. I think it's there's also a time required

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:22.622Z)

But they're they're sort of separate. Right. And that and that's what Mark Right? Think Yeah. Mark, that's what you were saying. It's almost like a tear

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:25.215Z)

Mark has been 2%. It's almost like a tiered selling strategy. That you the way we have to figure out.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:30.122Z)

selling strategy that you the way we have to figure out. To approach it. And and think this, like, what we have, like, right now, I would think is

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:36.155Z)

For executive they're gonna fit.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:37.782Z)

like, for the executives that are gonna that you know, like, I think about Davidson where I was working

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:40.735Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:42.512Z)

Right? That has, like, therapy. You got, like, 15 people on their

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:43.855Z)

On their own. Their underwriting

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:47.202Z)

their underwriting, you know, acquisitions team, and and they're all based remotely. And

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:50.155Z)

ready. So skills.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:51.602Z)

any given time, they're probably underwriting, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:51.795Z)

And for the head of the chief to be able to, like,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:53.762Z)

30 deals.

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:54.445Z)

have a look like

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:54.872Z)

And for the head of the team to be able to, like, have a lit like, this would

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:55.665Z)

I think like

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:25:58.522Z)

I think, like, be very interesting to him. Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T21:25:59.715Z)

to get

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:26:00.952Z)

To be able to to

### You (2025-05-19T21:26:01.135Z)

better handle on all the stuff that you do. You know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:26:03.632Z)

get a better handle on all the stuff that he's doing. You know, whether or not the analysts would like it,

### You (2025-05-19T21:26:03.645Z)

or not the analyst, point.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:26:08.552Z)

you know, it's a different question.

### You (2025-05-19T21:26:09.485Z)

Look.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:26:10.062Z)

Well,

### You (2025-05-19T21:26:13.435Z)

Let Howard

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:26:13.882Z)

think Okay. I I'll let Howard probably, that form, and then we'll we'll discuss few more things.

### You (2025-05-19T21:26:25.705Z)

Yeah. And this will just take a couple minutes. It's getting late here. So Vinod and I spoke earlier today. And I wanna make sure I bring up the correct window here. Okay. So this is kind of an example of what I was referring to earlier about what we would input on a page. So going back to what Vinod just showed you, just imagine, if you will, up at the top here, above the here will be those KPI cards, he was showing. We could show, you know, certain metrics that are specific to food and beverage as well as the overall metrics. We could have different tables here off on the left here where these numbers are would be the navigation. Right? So let's just kinda put ourselves in a place where I'm an analyst, and I need to put in my food and beverage numbers. K. So I would click on that food and beverage tab on the left hand side or the the link and it will take me to this page. So on this page here, I could select, you know, which of these are applicable. And we could probably make it so it includes more, or maybe they can write in or select custom ones. And then there is also an input on that Excel spread sheet where you input the number average guests per occupied room, I just put in some numbers here. Now all of these numbers are calculated fields, so none of these numbers tie to I'm gonna show you yet because I actually literally just worked on this up until our call today. And everything on the right hand side is just for me to check. So just think, you know, this will be our food and beverage page. So here in blue, I would input what are my total nonguests for food and beverage because this did break it up by hotel guests. Nonguests, and then amount per person. So down here, this is where I could go in here and say, okay. This is where I need to do my input. So, you know, I I would have a little caret here. That I would click, it would expand the section here. Now I know this kinda hard to see, so I'm gonna make it actually a little smaller just so you can see it fit on the screen. I won't worry too much whether you can read the numbers or not. But so here, let's just say we have a bar and a restaurant. We don't have room service or banquet. So you can see bar and restaurant is here. This is where I input my percentage of guest usage. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And then I could go down here and expand that and then go down to the middle section and do the same thing for my non hotel usage. Right? So you can probably get the picture here that this is what the the user would go through in every time that I make a change, in any of these fields here, you'll immediately see the change reflected up here. Let me say, so I got up here I've got a five year hold period in this one. Could go up to ten. These columns would not be visible if I only had a five year. I just put it in here so I could see the whole width essentially. This is what we're talking about, being able to go group by group or page by page or by department. And you input the information, you see the results immediately along with those cards that would be up here at the top. So if it did change my IRR or if it did change my overall valuation, I could go back and modify it right there immediately on the fly, and I don't have to go back to this page or this tab to find out what's going on here. So so that's really the goal is we just need to bake this as easy as possible to as quick as possible so that users can come up here and make a modification see the result immediately, And then when I'm done, I would go ahead and go back to my next page, or do my inputs there. So So our like, worksheet. Right? It is. Like, each one could be

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:30:56.882Z)

So, Howard, it's like a work

### You (2025-05-19T21:30:58.245Z)

Can I ask you a question? Is if an underwriter were to say,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:00.172Z)

sheet. Right? It's almost like each one The the breakdown. Ask

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:01.615Z)

okay. This is just a select service hotel, like, connecting your point

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:03.642Z)

question? Is if an underwriter were to say, okay. This is just

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:06.065Z)

things that you yeah. I just wanna use just a simple POR, and I wanna get into the detail. You can

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:07.952Z)

select service hotel, like, kinda like to your point that there were things, and maybe I just wanna

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:11.135Z)

override it. Right? Somehow, there's a way to

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:12.172Z)

use just a simple POR, and I don't wanna get into the detail.

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:13.595Z)

say, turn off the detail and just do the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:15.282Z)

You can just override it. Right? Somehow, there's a way to just say,

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:16.015Z)

a sim Do that make sense? Like Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:18.842Z)

turn off the detail and just to use a SIP

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:18.845Z)

Yeah. So yeah. Absolutely. If if that's what we wanna do,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:21.162Z)

Does that make sense? Like, right.

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:23.425Z)

that's the the the we will have to have a menu where the user can say, this is what do I want the detail? Or do I wanna just say it's gonna grow by 3% a year? And they Right. Figure historical. Right? So, yeah, you have to give them an opportunity to do both.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:31:36.222Z)

Gray.

### You (2025-05-19T21:31:38.365Z)

So but as I was going through and looking at all the different pages that we wanna have ready for the proof of concept, this one seemed to be the most difficult. At least on that spreadsheet that I found, because so many inputs. I didn't even realize it until today when I started looking at it. And I'm like, wait a minute. There's hidden rows here. And all a sudden, I expand these rows, and I see all these different inputs in there. And I'm like, oh my god.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:05.672Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:06.385Z)

I gotta get this.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:09.032Z)

And in in one in one confession is this I because I combined three different models for the model I gave you. I combined, like, a model that had really

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:21.945Z)

That had some real estate outputs.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:22.132Z)

great, just general inputs, and then I had to go find a model that had

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:25.745Z)

Fun beverage that's created

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:27.042Z)

some real estate outputs. This was a model that on the food and beverage that was

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:27.575Z)

by a real estate person. Who prob doesn't understand understand food and beverage.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:31.772Z)

created by a real estate person who probably doesn't understand food and beverage

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:32.475Z)

And budget was a food and beverage person, though. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:36.742Z)

as much as a food and beverage person dot you know what I mean?

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:37.915Z)

this be a great year to be to rely

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:40.602Z)

So this would be a great area for, like, maybe a prop Prakashani analyst. Because, Mark, you guys underwrite some pretty

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:46.745Z)

big food beverage operation. I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:49.732Z)

complicated deals, right, with big food and beverage operations. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:50.855Z)

you have a food and beverage page, or think your house

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:54.262Z)

And, I mean, if you guys have a food and beverage page or

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:54.955Z)

look at food and beverage,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:32:58.312Z)

if your analysts look at food and beverage because I think they're probably breaking it out by

### You (2025-05-19T21:32:58.465Z)

coverage. It up by the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:03.222Z)

banquets. They're probably bake breaking it out by maybe a a specialty restaurant may or or maybe just the outlets and banquets. I don't know. Right? And then the PORs of the guests. Just a general POR number. I I'm rambling, and I'm sorry, but I know that Mark and Drew know what I'm

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:18.945Z)

We just the size

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:21.242Z)

what I'm rambling about. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:21.645Z)

of each venue. Right? Because you know, it's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:23.632Z)

We should also put something in here about just the size of each venue. Right? Because that's you know, it's

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:23.895Z)

you want the the speech constraints and context for the feedback.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:28.542Z)

we wanna put the the spatial constraints in context

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:28.815Z)

Per hour.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:32.402Z)

with the amount of revenue per outlet?

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:33.075Z)

From square footage or to a table or to something that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:34.672Z)

Mhmm. When I add a line for just the these the number of

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:35.805Z)

helps the analyst from getting carried away.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:37.782Z)

of square footage or or tables or just something that

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:38.845Z)

The revenue. Right? So now you know, create a lot of revenue

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:40.962Z)

helps analyst from getting carried away with the revenue. Right? Because sometimes you create a lot of revenue, but then you don't think about how much how many people can actually squeeze into the venue.

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:47.425Z)

CVS. CVS

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:50.052Z)

Right. And that's actually a great place where CVAT CVAT information can come in.

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:50.215Z)

we'll quickly learn if that's even information is accurate or not, but they have the four plans

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:54.392Z)

I guess we'll quickly learn if that CVEN information is accurate or not

### You (2025-05-19T21:33:54.885Z)

the square footage is only now. So some have to go and, like, research all of that and then keyed in if we can just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:33:58.132Z)

but they have the floor plans and the square footage is all laid out. So some poor analyst doesn't have to go and, like, research all of that and then

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:02.285Z)

scrape it. From the seat belt. Page. I think it could be

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:05.612Z)

key it in if we can just

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:06.915Z)

incredibly helpful. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:07.022Z)

scrape it from the c vent. Page. I think it could be incredibly helpful.

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:11.395Z)

Could just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:13.142Z)

But but also keep in a lot a lot of this information, you know,

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:13.535Z)

Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:16.212Z)

could just be in the broker package. Mhmm. Right? So so is there a way for the user to just input it sort of the old fashioned way

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:20.425Z)

Basis. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:24.012Z)

at least on a neutral basis?

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:24.565Z)

Whether you try

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:26.872Z)

We we we talked initially about

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:27.225Z)

be trying to sell it to you like,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:29.302Z)

whether we would try be, you know, trying to sell this to

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:29.985Z)

full service service.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:33.732Z)

like, full service you know, teams or investors that do more full service, high end luxury

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:36.435Z)

You know? Or more. Flex. You know, terms of

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:40.592Z)

product, you know, hotels or more of the selects

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:43.775Z)

I guess,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:44.522Z)

limited service And

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:47.935Z)

We were still gonna, you know, probably try to tackle on the credit.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:48.762Z)

I guess I don't know if we ever really, like, settle on that. I think we were still gonna, you know, probably try to tackle both. But I think this

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:54.435Z)

Upscale, complex, complex hotel.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:55.192Z)

is really more useful to a full service, you know, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:34:57.975Z)

There was a lot of lot of investors across

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:34:59.202Z)

upscale comp like, complex hotel.

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:01.505Z)

tried mess across different property types. So you may have investment in customer service, full service,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:03.542Z)

There was a thing a lot of a lot of investors invest across different property types. You may have an investor who does select service, full service,

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:08.965Z)

service,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:11.012Z)

and we support

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:12.115Z)

I think it's good to, you know, to tie your point, maybe just dial it up or dial it down based on the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:12.202Z)

and if we want if we wanna become, like, their one stop shop for accumulating all their data, I think it's good to, you know, to Diane's point, maybe just dial it up or dial it down based on the

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:16.695Z)

specifics on the asset by getting the user the full of access, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:21.492Z)

specifics of the asset by giving the user

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:22.505Z)

I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:24.372Z)

the full range of accessibility. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:26.045Z)

know, I

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:27.602Z)

I think my my first thought here is that a lot of flex service hotels won't have all of this information. Like, of the 300 hotels that we work with, I'd say, you know, maybe half

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:43.075Z)

know, track, like, an extra

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:44.142Z)

provide

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:46.205Z)

like, customers

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:47.122Z)

like, you know, even even track I shouldn't say

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:49.875Z)

but it's not.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:50.142Z)

track. Like, they obviously track, like, customers, like, F and B customers and labor stats.

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:52.665Z)

So it's not as easy to get

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:54.662Z)

But it's not

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:55.435Z)

But your question

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:55.482Z)

included in their accounting data.

### You (2025-05-19T21:35:56.565Z)

question, I know I'm very happy.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:35:57.422Z)

So it's not as easy to get like, if you're underwriting a, you know, a Marriott managed or Hilton managed or a Hyatt managed property, they have would have all this information, and you could populate the historicals very easily.

### You (2025-05-19T21:36:08.455Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:36:08.702Z)

But if you're going to, like, a McKibbon or an LBA or

### You (2025-05-19T21:36:11.005Z)

operators.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:36:12.442Z)

like, in one of the select service, you know, third party operators, they're not gonna have this information, and they're probably not going to be able to get it to you. I mean,

### You (2025-05-19T21:36:20.605Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:36:20.912Z)

even if you own the hotel, even if you're an active owner, they're still not gonna be able to get it to you very consistently.

### You (2025-05-19T21:36:21.725Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:36:25.552Z)

So I think it's important to have like, what Diane was saying is just just the default should be look at look at it on a POR, PAR, or in big you know, maybe banks and cater, you might do per group room basis or percent of revenue. Right? Like, those are those are like, you're always gonna have room sold. That is the one statistic you're always going to get. So you can always base other thing and can always base other things on that. And then if the additional data is available, I think this is extremely useful. Or, you know, or if it becomes available as you work through the acquisitions process,

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:00.035Z)

to the

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:01.912Z)

I think it becomes really useful. But I think that thinking to the tab that we looked at previously, like, on the the UI. I think it'll be really important to have a little bit more functionality on that tab

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:12.345Z)

before

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:13.502Z)

to give the users the ability to input data there.

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:15.795Z)

you know, hundred dollars it's almost like hundred dollars.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:17.182Z)

Before going here because you're that's huge jump. That's from, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:20.205Z)

Three. Outstages between

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:20.652Z)

you know, hundred thousand it's from, like, a hundred thousand feet down to 10,000 feet. There needs to be a couple stages of between or maybe at least one stage in between, perhaps. How are we we love the I think with, like, the worksheet idea is awesome. Right? Yeah. No. I this is what

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:30.125Z)

doing in Excel. That they have the backup to their work to prove to show that, you know, I have the analyze that it's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:34.592Z)

someone's doing in Excel so that they have the backup

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:37.485Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:37.612Z)

to their work to prove to show that, you know, I have analyzed this.

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:38.435Z)

if you want the tool, you could too far

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:42.352Z)

And

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:42.555Z)

a ball.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:43.582Z)

you want before you go too far because this would this was of all of everything I gave you, this was probably one of the

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:50.495Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:50.992Z)

least hotel y kind of analyses. So

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:51.215Z)

this you want me to take this stab at, like, another f and b workshop?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:55.232Z)

I can take a do you want me to take a stab at, like,

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:56.345Z)

That looks maybe a little

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:37:58.292Z)

another f and b worksheet that looks

### You (2025-05-19T21:37:59.635Z)

Yeah. I'm I'm just trying to reverse engineer

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:02.372Z)

maybe a little different than this, but

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:03.295Z)

was said.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:04.542Z)

more like okay. Alright. Well, look. Again, if I could just I mean, I I I think we should

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:08.875Z)

What to have

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:10.402Z)

my opinion is is

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:11.415Z)

Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:12.452Z)

maybe just think about what we want

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:12.855Z)

I guess this is great.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:14.642Z)

to have in version one.

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:15.845Z)

It'll be

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:16.432Z)

And I guess

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:16.515Z)

should come up

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:18.712Z)

this is great, but but you know, maybe we should come up with a list of priorities and and say, like, you know,

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:22.165Z)

one.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:24.412Z)

maybe one through 10 are in version one and maybe 10 11 through 20 are in version two.

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:27.445Z)

To 30. Point But

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:30.212Z)

And maybe, you know, 21 through 30 or version three, you guys get the point.

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:30.535Z)

you know, ourselves from just getting

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:34.182Z)

But I just like you know, how do we present our prevent ourselves from just getting these are all great ideas. But there's only so much that we can reasonably accomplish in the next three weeks and and make like, we we wanna have I think we need, like, 10 or 12, like, wow things

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:47.605Z)

do in first two. Yeah. I I I should've I should've clarified.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:50.652Z)

Maybe this is something that we do in version two.

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:52.495Z)

Yeah. This is not realistic to get into version one.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:38:53.772Z)

I mean, just just in terms of being realistic with time,

### You (2025-05-19T21:38:56.345Z)

I just kinda wanted to to show the level of detail that at some point we're gonna have to get into for some of these. And and and to Drew's point, know, and it kinda goes along with what Diane mentioned earlier is, our our first user should probably be what I would say the least sophisticated out there. Not not that they're not knowledgeable, but like like, Mark, the the the model you sent was for a Holiday Inn Express. There was no food and beverage. I wanted to see if I could get some other food and beverage in there. And I went back there, I could not find any food in there. To use one that wasn't super

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:39:33.722Z)

You know, I I purposely

### You (2025-05-19T21:39:34.245Z)

in was trying to No. No. That that's right. But that's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:39:37.132Z)

tried to use one that wasn't super complicated because I just was trying to

### You (2025-05-19T21:39:37.235Z)

wasn't But that that's the type of that's the type of investor we should be talking to first.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:39:40.582Z)

I intentionally picked that.

### You (2025-05-19T21:39:42.935Z)

Let's do the simple things first, and then we can start getting it. I mean, we haven't even talked about resorts and and golf and all these other things that we could potentially get in there. I mean, yeah. Yeah. I mean, if we tried to go to market with this level of detail in the food and beverage and and it it's wrong, we're never gonna have a second meeting. With them. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:11.072Z)

Right. This is like I mean, there were there were a dozen there were a dozen things

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:13.085Z)

Feel like it's it's productive.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:14.512Z)

I think version one needs to have.

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:15.195Z)

For them to spend. Time. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:16.702Z)

So that the users can feel like it's it's

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:17.385Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:19.162Z)

productive for them to spend their time.

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:21.275Z)

check just so we can

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:21.462Z)

And

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:22.495Z)

see that

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:22.782Z)

I think maybe we should just come up with a list and just use that as a reality check and just so we can

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:26.035Z)

know, couple of

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:27.422Z)

because everyone's busy doing a lot of different things.

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:27.495Z)

essential things. That have to be there. Particularly

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:29.822Z)

You know, there's just a a couple of essential things that have to be there

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:30.065Z)

good. He was a work. You know, productive Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:34.382Z)

for it to kinda be usable or or

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:34.875Z)

You start us off? Can you just can you maybe circulate an email, say, here's my top

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:36.762Z)

know, productive. Are we

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:38.945Z)

12, and then have Drew and weigh in and yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:43.132Z)

Yeah. Sure. Mhmm. And I would like for us

### You (2025-05-19T21:40:50.215Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:40:50.952Z)

think I know this tool is targeted towards acquisition people. But in in the real practical world out there right now, what I'm seeing, Mark, maybe I think you're seeing something different, but I'm seeing a lot of refi going on versus straight up acquisition. And so there could be debt groups that need this tool before even if they've just from the volume of work that they're looking at, You know, like, we're going to MetLife right now to try to get a refi. So MetLife's debt group has to underwrite this. Right? And and, of course, there has to be an appraiser too. But

### You (2025-05-19T21:41:26.665Z)

it's like

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:41:28.862Z)

I I just wanna put it out because it's so it's like it's like peanut butter and jelly. Right? They go together, and debt people underwrite at a high level, and they have to underwrite fast, and they have to underwrite

### You (2025-05-19T21:41:34.455Z)

That's strong. That that could be a very good place to start.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:41:39.602Z)

volume.

### You (2025-05-19T21:41:41.065Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:41:44.892Z)

From a from a monetization

### You (2025-05-19T21:41:45.005Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If if you're you're right. They don't need to get into that level of detail. They're gonna use

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:41:50.522Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-19T21:41:51.835Z)

kind of a rule of thumb And and that's kinda what I was thinking with with your comment earlier when you mentioned, you know, instead of getting into this detailed can we just do POR or PAR and and and sounds to me like that's probably what a lender would do. If Yeah. So, yeah, I agree. I think that would be a great place to to start looking.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:42:10.692Z)

Right. That's what a lender would do. Yes. Yeah. And you guys, this has been such a productive call. I have to go. It is my son's seventeenth birthday, and we're having chicken parm for dinner. My husband's cooking. I have presents I've gotta get wrapped, which is why you see my head bobbing back and forth because I'm trying to, like, locate them all. And, for, next week is Memorial Day. So is there a way we can move this to Tuesday?

### You (2025-05-19T21:42:40.415Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:42:44.242Z)

Instead of Monday?

### You (2025-05-19T21:42:44.445Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:42:46.462Z)

That's fine with me. Sure. And is Tuesday 01:30 or 04:30? What works better for folks? Tuesday is my the next next week is my Columbus Day. So Columbus week. Sorry. So Vinod, what works best for you then next week? And we can doesn't have

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:01.725Z)

Just

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:03.932Z)

be Monday or it doesn't have to be Tuesday or, like, just based on your

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:04.235Z)

but probably not. Last week. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:07.492Z)

because you have the hardest schedule of of probably all of us next week. Yeah. I mean, I can do Tuesday, but after five. I can do any day after five. When I'm not going to office, but I can, do anytime on Monday or Fridays. Otherwise, weekend as

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:23.025Z)

So that's

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:23.792Z)

well. If you are available on Saturdays, Sundays, I mean,

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:24.665Z)

could it. Before the end of

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:26.622Z)

Got it. So if that's the case, then we could do it on Memorial Day. That's

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:27.105Z)

I just o'clock.

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:31.112Z)

I mean, I just it's it's up to the group. Would you rather do it Tuesday, 05:00 or would you rather do it Monday or some other time over the holiday weekend?

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:32.915Z)

Monday. Or some other time over the holiday What time month that we discussing? One time we normally would do it

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:44.262Z)

What time on Monday were you suggesting?

### You (2025-05-19T21:43:47.165Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:43:47.662Z)

### Guest (2025-05-19T21:44:38.752Z)

Put it on my list of things to to figure out. It's a long list.
