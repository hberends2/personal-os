Good morning. Hey, jen. Back again? Good morning. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Good. Sorry, but. Sorry about the other day. I just said we're getting some work done here, so I couldn't put them off. No, no. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us. I mean, I know you're really, really busy, and I appreciate. You taking time out of your schedule. So how do you think it's best? Because I do want to make the most of your time, and I see you as just an incredibly smart person that. I mean, your advice is important to us. You understand the industry. I'd like to, you know, if you're interested. We can show you under the hood a little bit about what we've created and kind of. What love to do that. Okay. All right, great. And then maybe we can end with some conversations about, like, how we see. Just explore a little bit, too. You'd mentioned that at Airbnb, you guys might be looking at trying to secure some sort of AVM on the residential side. So I just wanted to poke around around that idea. And then last after you see what we've created. I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts as well as if maybe even if it be something you would be interested in working with us part time on something like this. So just kind of plan all those seeds. Okay, Howard. You want to take it away? You too, Howard. How are you?

### You (2025-11-13T14:03:57.652Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:04:36.932Z)

Right. Okay? Right.

### You (2025-11-13T14:07:01.572Z)

Information. That we have. In the deal. Er.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:08:12.212Z)

Can I ask a question? Right there. Would it? Work in reverse as well. If I said, look, this is what I'm buying it for, and as I continue to work through this, I mean, that cap rate might change because my assumptions might change on, you know, I'm taking things in and out of the expenses like, this is an extraordinary. They have asset management above. The line. We're not going to have that in. It'd be interesting if it worked both ways, because to me, to sit there and calculate the cap rate at first, I mean, You know, 6.175. Six more, you know, versus just throwing in a. This is the price I'm paying. And we're just, we're going to continue to develop the income. It's like, I was just wondering if it went, if it worked both ways. Gotcha. Right. Okay?

### You (2025-11-13T14:09:40.532Z)

Information. Model.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:11:02.852Z)

And can you load in mez as well? I mean, everyone's using mez today.

### You (2025-11-13T14:11:15.652Z)

Right. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:11:15.972Z)

Right. That's interesting. So you're. You're going to work on an after a post Noi Waterfall. As well. Okay? Okay? Because I. Because just a ton of people like as, you know, like, that's when they dump it into their own Excel models and only trust their own. Their own kind of waterfall analysis. I mean, you know, some people are really particular about that.

### You (2025-11-13T14:11:57.492Z)

Make.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:11:59.732Z)

Yeah. Super, super unique. Super tricky. I'm not. I'm not sure I would tackle it, to be honest with you.

### You (2025-11-13T14:12:15.172Z)

It.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:12:18.532Z)

Okay? Okay? That'd be that. That. That'd be really interesting to see it to see.

### You (2025-11-13T14:12:37.492Z)

To. That point.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:12:39.732Z)

And if I could mention a real world comparable, there's a company called Paraview that is doing investment. It's basically a SaaS platform for investment management that then has a direct integration into Juniper Square. Right, for the like for the owner or for the investor, distribution and all of that they're tackling. Waterfall right now, and I've had some discussions with their clients about. I mean, it's an ordeal. It is, truly. I mean, to. To transfer Excel Waterfall analysis into a SaaS platform, but what they're finding is the number of errors that have been made. And Excel Waterfall Analysis is kind of beyond expectation. Right? Like that. There's, there's, as an industry, we're making way more mistakes in that waterfall analysis than we'd really like to believe, so I found that, Found that interesting. That's absolutely horrifying. Right, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Because I imagine. It's so unbelievably true. If I had to think about. I mean even, even people gaming the year with, gaming it with, you know, working in meters with mid year discounting or something like that. I mean you're just. You're right, you can. I mean they're probably. The the amount of violations that are going on are probably unbelievably huge. But again, as Howard said, that's going to be. I mean, it's in our roadmap. It's in our roadmap because we see competitors doing it and having success with it, but it's not. We have a. We have, like a to do, and then we've got a parking lot of things that follow, and so that will be a later item. But I think it's critical for us. If our goal is end to end connectivity, acquisition to disposition, then and groups like peer review are doing this, then we need to be able to create a solution eventually in our software that does allow us to have have that capacity to do the waterfalls. Yeah, that makes. That makes sense.

### You (2025-11-13T14:15:10.452Z)

Keep. Up. There.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:15:38.932Z)

I agree. I say the same thing. I may use it. I use it daily. In research and. From six months ago. I mean, the error rate is down 10x from what it. What, what it was six months ago. I can't believe how much better. Grok4 super heavy because I. I pay for the, you know, whatever, $300 a month or whatever they charge to get. To get the best model I possibly can. And I really, really surprised. Like, blown away. Like, how much. How much better it was. Because sometimes I'm like, all right, this is just nonsense. I mean, like, I. I know this isn't. And I'm literally telling it facts that I absolutely know, and it's. And it's arguing back. Like, that can't be possible. Like, this can't. Possibly be, you know, on the coast of Georgia and Atlanta in the same day. I'm like, yeah, they can. I mean, we have cars, you know, I mean. But it's odd how. It's amazing how much. How. How good it's getting. Hold on one second. I gotta grab something from my. My menacing dog. Drop it. Drop it. Thank you. He likes to steal little things that he can shoot. And. And, Jim, one other concept that we're very. We're gonna be very disciplined on is build by partner. Build by partner. Built by partner, right? There's gonna be certain things we build. There are gonna be certain things that are just not worth building in house. And so we're gonna partner, right? And. So and there there'll be maybe some things eventually down the road we buy as well. And so that is, I think, when you talk to startups, at least like our anchor investor, confidentially, is Driftwood. I may have mentioned that on Thursday. And they're very, very focused on that as well, focused on bringing together AI Solutions kind of into a room of company of companies that you can then partner with. Right. And so in the same with their ventures. Right. Their canary technology on voice activation and things like that. I don't mean to digress, but like, as we advance through and add AI features, we might not build all the AI features ourselves. We may be partnering with people that are well advanced then we are, and bringing some of that technology in. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I wish Airbnb would do more than. And we're so big now that they like. We like to try to come up with solutions. And I'm working on something right now where there's a better platform already. And we should just buy it, but instead, I have a feeling we're. We're gonna be ignorant about it. And it's one of those things where, I mean, we should buy this right now for $50 million. Not what you guys are talking about, because we don't. Valuations don't matter. To us, but we should buy this other software or this other platform I'm talking about right now. Because it's one of those things like, we should buy it now for $250 million, or we're going to end up buying it for a billion. Right? Right. Yeah. And I could see the handwriting on the wall. It's a platform that is so much better than what we do. And so value add. And it was. And as a lot of these things are that are accretive in our industry, they're written by people who used to be at Airbnb, like they saw that they saw. They're like, we need to do this. We need to do this. We're not going to do this. So they're like, okay, well, I'm going to leave because it's a huge business and they leave. They leave and develop it. And they're crushing right now and they're using AI in a way that far better than anyone in our short term rental industries using. And I see it. And I know they have meetings scheduled with my competitors because I talk to the founder. We have a standing call every Friday, and I talk to them and it's like, you guys are going to miss it. And I'm like, I'm not in charge. I know we're going to miss it. But the people who I could get that appoint that point across, who don't care, I mean, this isn't a hotel company before where I had some level of stroke. I have zero level of stroke at Airbnb because it's a tech company and I'm a real estate guy. They don't care about real estate people. They barely can spell real estate. But anyway, I do mean to digress. I just wanted to make that point. Like that is in a roadmap. And so. And Howard point is correcting your point is changing so quickly that it's almost. I mean, we've gone back. Howard has gone back and rethought some of the things we had planned just three months ago because of the rate of acceleration on AI success and things. Yeah, that's. That's the same thing I'm seeing. I'm glad that someone else is seeing it because it's to say it's not impossible to keep up with. But so far, everything, it's much, much better. I don't see it overthinking, but I don't. I mean, the mistake level has gone down. I mean, so unbelievably noticeably that I can't believe more people aren't talking about. From a. From both a good basis and potentially horrifying basis. That how much better it's getting this fast. Right. Right. Okay. Sorry. We can keep going. Sorry about that. And just jumping in for one quick second is it was our intention to build this just like what an acquisition hotel model looks like, right? So that if you're an acquisition person, this looks and feels very familiar to you. The only two changes really are is you're no longer copying, pasting, uploading, copying pasting. Up the right you know that piece has been taken out for you, which is incredibly time consuming and the metrics cards become very live and all visible on one page but and we probably have more work to do to get the UI exactly like our various use how calls them Personas. So like a Persona is a data structure, finance company or platform. Right. And acquisition person, an appraiser, you know, even a brand and management feasibility company. But we want this to feel so much like it's their own model that they've been using for a long time that it isn't as hard of a transition as some people think. It could be so. I'm sorry, Howard. I just had to. I just wanted to jump in and try to. Okay. Right. The source of truth is the str code. Yeah, makes sense. It's actually one of my original questions. So jumping in here right at the star code right now is the best code we have. But the HLA is working on an industry. Working group to establish a unified identifier code for hotels. And their focus is really on operations, right? Because you need to understand if you have a hotel that's posting on Expedia and it's posting on hotel tonight, right? It's posting on like, is it the actual same hotel? And so they're trying to work on finding a code maybe outside of star, developing a system that allows them from the travel tech side or right to have the correct unique identifier code that connects it all our ideas, we would love to join that group, that working group, and pull that concept through the real estate right to have a unique identifier code that pulls through on the real estate aid so that you have confirmation that the hotel, like whatever your underwriting, you know, the lender is this, that eventually the PCA reports will roll up and be identified, you know, and connected with unique identifier code. So the work is already in. Existence. We just have to network with the AHLA and get in there and prove to them that there's a lot of value on the real estate side to doing this and that the work could be the work that that would be done would benefit both sides of the funds. So that's a partner thing for us, right? We want to go in and be partner and fade. And we might not initially be able to monetize that as much as we would hope. Long term, having some sort of unique identifier code that's not tied to star, I think just helps our industry overall and can will help us create future products. That really could be amazing from tracking of capex and warranties and all of that. As long as ahla is going to be agnostic to the fact whether they're hla members. I mean, if they're just going to do HLA members, then a whole thing falls apart. Oh, oh, I see. You mean, like, as far as the code doesn't apply if you're not an ASLA member. Yeah, Yeah, I have thought about that. That's a good point. Because we are vehemently anti hla, I can tell you that. They are totally opposed to us in unreasonable. So we will do. I mean, we will actively fight. Ahla, and we have way more money. And they're really, really, really screwing up right now as far as their hostility. Because they're making a petulant child mad. You're making a 43 year old billionaire mad. And when you make a 43 year old Billy, I mean, I've seen it with. I've seen it when berry was a 40. Well, Berry wasn't a billionaire at 43, but I've seen it when. I've seen what happens when you make petulant children mad, I mean. They break things. They smash things. We hired Chip Rogers. Right. Chip works for us. Right. Does he still work for you? The modern elder? No, not chip connolly. We hired the CEO of hla. We hired chip roger. Whoa. Well, then. Right, so you guys may be a better advisor for us on a unique identifier code than I had what my original thought was on it. But I have no idea. There's something out there that is very easy to enact. But look, if I may, I'm. If I'm Ahla, I want to be the creator of that code. But they'll be smart enough. They'll go. They'll have to go agnostic, I mean. Someone's got to mention it to them. Like you don't get a code if you're not part of ahla, then. I mean, then you're just gonna alienate the non HLA members even farther. Right? Right. That's an excellent point. And then, you know, that could actually be made because sometimes owners aren't members of ATEL and ahla. Right? It's. It tends to be more the operator community and the owner community. They're only involved if they're an owner operator, so that's a but. Anyway, I just wanted to mention it because right now it's start code. That's the only code that really exists to unify. But we'd like to try to figure out a solution that can help us on the. On the real estate side and help us to be able to connect, you know, again, pca. Esa. You know, like all that different type of data that needs to be identified and attached to an asset. Yeah. I mean, you make, you make, you make a great point on how this could really be a. I mean, it could. It could be something unifying that works. I mean, it's like the fact that you can find out anything about a used car you're looking at. Right? Right. Yes, because it's on. The vin. Yeah, it would be. It would be cool. So. And again, I digress. Sorry, Howard. So. Okay? Right.

### You (2025-11-13T14:32:46.452Z)

Automatically.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:34:13.572Z)

And the view on, you know, the call arounds, which we all do. We've done it for years and years and years. Right. And then you get the individual. You were an appraiser, right? So, you know, you try to go track down what the individual hotels in the comp set are actually performing at the way we view that is that would be almost like a shell of a product that our clients can use we would not ever touch. I mean, we're. We're not using that data to roll it up in anything. We're not aggregating, anonymizing that. That literally just exists for them, so. That they don't have to look through 20 different underwriting files right, on their network to go find that data. It just exists for them. And it is because we don't. We're not validating that information. Right. It's them call. It's just acquisition people or whatever appraisers. Calling around getting the data, but we want to make it so that it's very, very easy for them. To go back and find deals where they've already done, call around on numbers. And I pitched this to host about a year ago, and this is one of the components that they really loved about the idea. Of. And they spend so much money on technology, it's crazy, but they don't spend it so much on the acquisition side of the fans, and so they. They really love this idea. Yeah, they're. I mean, as you know, they're much more about portfolio management than they are acquisitions. I mean, they just. They don't buy much these days. I mean, it's just. I mean, it's the occasional. I mean, Four Seasons, Disney, you know, one south beach, one Nashville. They just. They buy. Giant things these days. They just. Their transaction volume is way down on a total basis. But their asset management is. Is. I mean, look, their CFO was an analyst who was my analyst. So he's incredibly technical. I'm sure this is something here. He would love have you. Do you probably know. It's semi related, I guess. But what's his name? Svetlan. No, I actually don't know. Spent more with. With open. His brother used to work for me. Agan chev. It's j a n c h e v. But his company is called open comps, I think. Oh, okay. No, I actually don't know him. Do you? I mean, are a lot of people using open comps now? From I know, I have no idea. I have no idea, but I. I don't know what kind of functionality they have. I just. I saw something on LinkedIn a few months ago, like celebrating whatever anniversary. I didn't even know they were still in existence, so I don't know, it just might be just worth. Yeah, no, absolutely. What is seeing. What open comps is because the Gon Chevs have a decent network. Augie worked at Starwood and worked at ihg. I'm not sure where he is now. I don't know where Svetlin. I think he's been working on this. I think they're. I think they're Granola guys, both of them. But, yeah, just take a look. I don't know if there's any. Any. Any potential synergy there. And where he's. You know, where they're getting their data feed, it's always just because. Because I would look at comps as being somewhat related. Yes. You. Know to what you're doing. I think it might be worth looking at. I believe it's called. I believe it's called open comps. Okay, let me. Let me do the research on it. One other thing that came up in the past two weeks that really could be game changing for us. I mentioned a little bit on the call on Tuesday is C Beren shut down their entire hotel research group. They're abandoning all the products. They're abandoning Horizons. They're abandoning Benchmark. And I've built a strong relationship with Mark Woodworth through when we both worked at C. Beren. And just our passion around this product. So, confidentially, we talked earlier this week about is there a way to before benchmark or totally dies of death, resurrect it? Right, because there's 8,000 hotels in Benchmarker and the hotels, I mean, it's all Vainbridge's portfolio, it's all Marriott. It's all Hilton, it's all Hyatt, it's all the big Berends Concord, Davidson. I mean, it's an amazing list of hotel comparables. That if we took this opportunity and if Mark Woodworth and Robert Mandelbaum and I and Howard, right, Like, if we sat down and kind of went and had strategic conversations, management company by management company, I think we could potentially keep it running, right? And then we would just process the data, which we're already processing. Data through AI extraction. And there's some, there's some also, you know, the old Bird API integration. But there's some agency solutions we could explore. But that would be an amazing like for us to be able to within 3 to 6 months have in software benchmarking that is aggregated anonymized all like what benchmarker was right, that that could be a big win on so many fronts for us. So that is, they, they're very positive about the idea. They want to work with us. And we just have to sit down and now think about how do you tackle, how do you, how do you I mean, you definitely don't want that dog to get away, you know? Right, right. That's what I'm thinking. If they're just putting it out to pasture, I mean. Yeah, that's what they're doing. They're putting it off the pasture. You can totally resurrect it and keep those connections live and show what it could. It could lead to, which is, you know, I think, far more exciting what they were doing with it. Obviously. I mean, they're going to regret that. They're going to regret abandoning that. That's a bad idea. It is a bad idea, but it's a good idea. It's a stroke of luck for. For us at this moment, right, because. And these relationships are so just circular, right, because Mark Woodworth, his number two of PKF was Jamie Lane. Jamie Lane runs Air DNA. Right, Jamie and Braum Gallagher went over to. Airdnd. I always get that. I'm sorry. My dyslexia kicks in. Air DNA. Air DNA. Right. But they're economists, at the end of the day, at least. Proms and economists. And so you just kind of just have this. All this circular thing going on where there's really something there. If we can put our minds together and figure out how to quickly go after it. So that's like, as of a Tuesday, a really positive update that could impact us so wonderfully in 1Q if we can pull 1Q 2Q if we can pull it off. That makes all the sense in the world. But Woodward doesn't have any stroke there anymore. I mean, so who's. Who's your champion inside? Is Mandelbaum still there or not? Well, they're literally firing the entire research group. So Robert Mandelbaum is gone as of December 31st. And Mark. Woodworth could. He's already brought on so many people from C. Beren, so he could bring on Robert in. I mean, and Robert's getting closer to retirement. I don't know if Robert wants to retire or not, but really, Robert, 150,000 would be worth his price in gold to be able to continue having conversations with all those relationships. Right. You just start to marry it with InnVestAI And so, I don't know, Robert joins Mark Woodworth and we enter into a strategic joint venture on it. Maybe they contribute the cost of Robert as safe note investment. Right. And they hand him over to us and let us work with him, and then Mark becomes, you know, an investor, just like Driftwood is an investment. That's another solution, but it's there. It just needs to be thought through, and I'm really excited about it. Great. So, again, Howard, I keep interrupting you, so let's go back to.

### You (2025-11-13T14:43:22.932Z)

Crack. Stop working. I like the keyboard. Straigh. T, okay?

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:43:47.412Z)

Right? Right. Okay?

### You (2025-11-13T14:44:13.892Z)

Financial. Statement. Focus.

### Guest (2025-11-13T14:44:18.212Z)

Great. Okay? Right. Gotcha. And the FFNE reserve as well, right? You have that in there that it can sometimes ramp 2, 3, 4, 5 or. Right, Howard? Or do we just not get there yet? Okay? Sure. An investor, meaning like an acquisition person. Right. Or a data structure versus one of our investors where we'll be looking for some working capital to try to help us, you know, because we've been doing, we've been doing this all on our own free time for the past year, and we probably have about a million dollars of spec time into building this product. But from a Persona perspective, we still need to do some. Howard, what do you call it? Like, you. I mean, you're the project manager, so you would call it, what, like, customer research work on what they want their UI to look like or how. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, we do the same thing. I mean, I'm working on Personas for two of our products right now. I mean, they're, you know, on condo. Condo and kind of hotel side. They're asking me to define the different people who will be accessing the product and how they will access and what they will use it for. And, you know, and so we're working on things like roles and permissions that if you're this type of person, if you're just a building manager. Well, this is all you're gonna see. You don't need to see the names and the first and last name of a guest that's checking in. That's probably too much PI for that level. But if you're the property, if you're the hotel manager. At the front desk who's gonna be checking IDs against that, that you need that level. So we work on Personas and roles and permissions, which are a really big deal when you're dealing with data. Right. And data, making the data as easy as it is possible for users. Right. So nobody has to go key in information anymore. I mean, that's like Core Central to. Right. So we are going to be. The LARC relationship is a good first step for us, but there are other relationships we're going to be exploring. Like Ryan on taxes, right? And C. Beren taxes and maybe Marsh on insurance. But like, and then if you were to think about, like, you know, maybe it's RCA on comm, Slark on sales comps. But our goal is that no acquisition, no deal person anymore has to go out and go find this information. And load it into a model themselves. We will have a gentic ar relationships. We're going to be Switzerland. Right? And we're going to. We're not going to mark up that data. It's not our intention. We want the best possible relationship we can with all those data providers. Hopefully, we help them sell more data. Right, because it's in in the underwriting tools automatically. But that is a very big important part of our strategy is that if a customer says, hey, we use this data all the time, or we would like to use this data. We're going to be going to that data provider and trying to create a solution where we can just, you know, kind of go in and have an integration or a push into our model, and then they would. We're not upcharging, we're not reselling the data. Right. It's just for the customer's benefit. And that's becoming more and more common in the industry. And the only groups that are still holding out. Yardi is a pain in the ass. They're not working with anyone still. Right? So there are workarounds with Yardi, but MRI and RealPage have been very good, which are going to be important to us as well because we don't end at the GOP level. Right. We have to get to the NOI level and we need to get to the debt service and the cash on cash level. So we have to be working with the real estate accounting systems as much as all of the hotel data providers and order to make this strategy successful. And you look at someone like Cheri, and I realized Cheri is like, the, you know, ultimate. They're doing it. They have relationships with so many of these groups and, and workarounds with Yardi. So that's a big part of our strategy as well, is no one ever has to key in information again. That part of their job is over and they can focus on underwriting. And finding the value and finding the upside in their acquisitions and their. Their loans. Yeah, right. Have you. Have you talked with hrec at all? Have you talked with Mike? Not yet, I haven't. I mean, he's. To me, Mike is one of the smartest guys in the entire business. I mean, his intellect is off the charts, and he's much, you know, obviously, he was much more on the consulting evaluation side, you know, for the longest time before the brokerage side, and I think that's still a pretty significant part of their business, and I don't know necessarily his focus, but. I mean, his intellect is off the charts. And he also started the Lodging Industry Investment Council, which is certainly. It's not IRE fac, and it's not, you know, it's not the. It's not the Uli Hotel Council, but I always found it to be the more down to earth and. More candid group of deal makers and deal doers and things out there that I think it still exists. LIIC Lodging Industry Investment Council. That Hre Hrac usually sponsors those meetings. Scott Stevens, who's the other part of their Scotts and Mai, I mean Scott, it probably still uses his letters and signs off occasionally on reports. But I don't know if mike is. Anymore. But they're very. I mean, they're very. I mean, they've got to value things daily, right? This is the kind of thing that would be. I mean, they probably have the arrogance of we know what something's worth when we look at it. But it's one thing to say that, but. It's another thing that hit this transparency that's being required today. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Here's the trailing four years, and here's the trailing 12. And here's where we're going. And then, you know, and these numbers have been vetted and the insurance numbers have been vetted and the real estate taxes. Numbers are right in there. Directionally, you know, correct. Look. This is really cool, what you're doing. I know that. I mean, if you think about. Just think about Blackstone and Brookfield. I mean, they both need stuff like this. I mean, they've got. They're public, you know, they need to know where their asset values are at at all time or part parts. Of a republic. No, they do. And so many people need to know that more than it used to be. And they need the transparency to show investors because much more of the business is going Howard retail. Right. And so you have to have that transparency available. Like Peachtree announced this morning that they bought an SBA lender. So they're going to be. They're going to need or a pizza. So Peachtree is buying the SBA lender that Greg Friedman's grandfather founded 43 years ago. And they're one of the largest SBA lenders in the country. So they're now going to be running like as fast as they run on the loans, and they've put out, what, 2.6 billion this year? They're going to be running even faster on these SBAs because that's 5 million and below. Right? So to me, that's when, like, these SBA lenders need automated, especially the ones that have that enjoy the ability to approve deals without the government's approval, like Western alliances. I mean, they, they are going to need these tools because they're just moving too fast. Yep. And so those are the top three. I mean so far. I mean we think it might be best to launch in the data structured finance group because the underwriting is so fast and high level. Western alliance Access point financial Impeachtree have all expressed interest Driftwood, who's our first free money safe node? Investor also has a credit group. And so we're going to be relying on them because they're now an investor in us, right. For feedback on the ui should look like and like, you know, how to make this a better product for that Persona. But Howard maintains consistently that the core model is the core model, right? That doesn't change. It just changes your the way your UI is changes a little bit if you're a lender, a little bit if you're an investor, a little bit if you're a management company. Right? A little bit if you're an appraiser. We'll never want to be appraisers ourselves. We don't want the risk of that business, but we want a product that helps appraisers do their work much more efficiently and that they're willing to pay for. So I know we're talk at the top of the hour and I want to just maybe plant a seed. Well one you are again. I'll go back to this one of the smartest down to earth great people I know in the industry and so any advice? You're way too kind. No, no, no. No, but it's true. But any advice you have or thought to have, I want any you're willing to share. But the second thing is I would. Howard and I aren't in a 100% position today to do this, but within the next, I don't know, by year end, I think we could be in a position to ask if perhaps you'd be interested in coming in, no equity required, but to be a partner with us in this, and for you, I mean, what that could do is you do your job at Air, you know, Airbnb, because we need time to get off the ground. But it could be something that becomes yours as well as it's ours. And we need a thinker like you on the team, and we're lacking that. Thinker right now. So we're, we are rethinking, like, we have a really strong chief technology officer that comes from multifamily. He is Indian. And so, like, I mean, some people like this idea, some people don't. But a lot of our software engineering team right now is offshore that's helping us from. An expense perspective. Incredibly, you have to. We do it. Right. Right. Howard. I could not. I'm just gonna say it like if. I didn't even understand what the benefit of a product chief product officer was until I worked with Howard for the past year. And now I realize we could never have done this without a product manager. That's my lesson learned. I did. Not know what product did until I came to Airbnb. It's a tech thing. It doesn't exist. It does really exist in our role because I talk to our product guy all the time. So our tech guy, we have product and eng and product and engine work, engineering work hand in hand. But engineering is. That's the point. He had it, guys. You know, that's the. That's, that's the coders. Our product guy came out of media. You know, I mean, he came out. I mean, he's, he's, he's, he was a, you know, a producer for, like, msnbc. I mean, he was, he's a, he's a. Or cnbc, but he's a, like, it's, it's, it's UX and. It's. I had no idea. Like, I so much respect. Like, I take my hat. His name's Jay, and I'm like, at least, like, my favorite person on the team because he just. So this is Howard, right? It looks at the stuff from this direction. I'm like, I would have never. Like, I just say this. You need to do this. And then he comes back with 8 million codependencies, adjacencies, and everything. I'm like, God. I just want you to do this. I didn't know it was gonna. I didn't know about the instructions for the software engineers and the fact that Howard is a real estate person and has a business background. And, you know, granted, it's multifamily, and now we're. We're. You know, but it's still. He understands real estate, and we're. We have enough competition with the calibres and, you know, single panes. Michelle Rousseau. We're going at this from the deal perspective. In. And Howard being a real estate person, I just. I. We could not have gotten where we are without. Product with Howard. We have a really great data partner, Andrew Wallace. I mean, we could potentially have another data partner if. If, for whatever reason, it doesn't work out because Drew has his own company, and we're still kind of debating, like, how much time, you know, until the end of our existence are you going to spend on your. Own company. This might be an acquisition for us, right? Because I think for a couple hundred K, we could probably roll him into us, and that would be amazing. But that's a strategic decision we need to make, and we need people who can think strategically on the team. And then there's myself. I'm running. Like crazy. And we lack someone like you, Jim. We lack someone that has the ability. And so I know you feel at Airbnb like, you know, you're the real estate guy. They make the tech decisions. This is the complete opposite. You know, if you. If this would be something you'd be interested in, you. Would be making decisions with us leading strategy, all of that. You could continue your job at Airbnb, and then when you're occupational A.D. d.D. Kicks in. Right. Or what? Right. Like, and you're ready to say, I'm done with this. You could actually, that's. That's more likely to be. My expiration date here than it is my occupational ad. I just don't want to work that much longer to be honest with this. But let me check, let me check with them because I did sign a ridiculously thick thing that I did not read when it came to working on other, other tech projects because they get really sensitive about it because people do that here, and then they start to introduce that tech product, that Airbnb. And it was done recently, and I had finally someone just turned to him, said, how much of this company do you own? He's like, well, not that much. Like 8%. And people were just like, you can't. You got to. You can't do that. Right. Right. Or at least. At least lead with it. At least say, hey, I own 8% of this company. And so, you know, because then it. It puts everyone on edge. But interestingly enough, Howard, like my group, our group here at Airbnb, the. Airbnb for real estate team globally. Like when you count every single person. I'm the only hotel person here. The rest of it's multi. We're all about multifamily because we're doing Our group was established to unlock short term rental options in multifamily where. Where we're the tenant has the right to sublease. I mean what is you know, with all of the multifamily out there, you know, almost every single lease agreement in the country written by, you know, the. The regular folks says you can't sublease. And so subleasing. Put it on Airbnb was a big deal. So now we're in 1200 different apartment complexes, and we're with Gracetar and UDR, and equity is something that's. So our whole business side right now is focused almost exclusively on apartments. I came in to do condo hotels, and now they're using some of that expertise to ship this in the hotels, but it's, it's. A lot to think. I'm not. I'm going to come up with some, some other ideas, but I'm definitely going to take a look at some of the things I talked about. I don't, I don't. You know, this, this open comps, I don't know anything about their data. Sources or anything else, but it's semi, somewhat related. And then, and then think about, think about HREC and Mike and Lodging Industry Investment Council and them. And if you're better friends with, if you're closer to Scott Stevens, maybe reach out to him instead, just because, I mean, I would say everyone knows you. You still, you, you still got, you know, unbelievable gravitas in the industry. But the one thing I'm finding, it's interesting when you talk about, like, Michelle Russo and Rachel and people like that, some of them are retiring. Yes. I mean, some of them, like Rachel origin just came, wants to retire. Right. She's trying to sell I've heard she's trying to sell her business and it's been. Or she's trying to have her, her partners buy her out and they're questioning the value of if they, if they want to do something like that. It's hard. I mean, I had mean, you know, that really sucks because she spent all this time building it up. But, I mean, is. Is there really intrinsic value in it rolling forward? I mean, I hired because of AI, because of what it's going to do to AI, And I hire people, not companies, you know? Right. So I. It's. It's. I, I'm. I. Some of my value to Airbnb will start to wane as my contacts start to not exist anymore, which is crazy, but, I mean. But what I see for you is, like. Well, again, I don't know how long you're interested in. Working. I don't know what, but I just know we lack your skill set. I have contacts. But we talked about this last summer, right? At the end of the day, I. I'm a woman, and so I get boxed out of conversations. I get boxed out of certain things that I just. I. I don't. Have the access to them that others would. And so you do, you have those contacts, right? And I think you would genuinely just enjoy the work. Right, because you wouldn't. Is never going to be a no gem. It's going to be Jim Cumming and saying, oh, hey, look, this, we could do this and this. And this and this and this. And you might really enjoy that aspect of it at this point in your career or within a year or two years of your career. Right? Because, like right now our chief technology officer is working a full time job. Right? We don't, we have not brought the working capital in yet to be able to pull him in full time. So that's step one, is we need to figure out a way to pull in 500 to 70 to 750k initially of working capital so that we can pull Ben Howard work for free for a year on this, completely free. And so we need to do that. And then we need to spend the next six months intensely working with potential users and those profiles, right, that we. That we talk about Personas so that we build a product they want, that we're not so arrogant. We go to the table and say, here's the product. Like, we've got the technology. Working. But what do you want in the user interface? What do you want? And so it's that. And then we got to figure out the pricing strategy, which is very complicated right now because of how AI is changing that. And we need thinkers. And if you want to. I mean, I just. Again, I'm just floating it. We don't. 100%. And if not, I'll just go back to, you know, any advice, any contacts, you know, you can give me, given our long term, you know, you know, colleagues and friendship is really. Appreciated. I think that, you know what's really interesting? That you say C. Beren shutting that part down. I mean, it's like the amount of data that they have that can be fed into these. This LLM to create the backbone of what you have. Yes. Because then you get, you know, like, the historical valuations. And the relations between, you know, NOI and where properties were transacting because, I mean, everything is cyclical and will slide back into where curves start to look the same again. And that should be, that should be predictive AI into where valuations are going based on that. And when you feed in the other things like, you know, where rates are and where SOFR is and that type of thing. So, I mean, why someone, someone at the board level is not a company to, at the, not just to come in and look at hospitality, but to look at the entire CV organization. And they came up and said, I mean, because it just doesn't make that much money. And it's small. It's the same thing I faced. You know why I was so heartbroken when they turned down this idea. But Rachel's gone. Robert Mandelbaum is gone. As the end of December, there is a young guy, Will Webster, and Will Webster is very good with data on his own. And he impressed me the first day. And then I'm at C. Beren because he works hard and he's smart. But I'm just gonna say this. He's also the son of Bob Webster, right? And so he doesn't need anything. He's rich. He's rich. Yes, but some of this is almost second generation. You know, it's like Mark Woodworth has Sam and Will. They're his sons and they're in this industry. Right? They're gonna have to survive whatever changes take place. Bob Webster has Will, and I'm forgetting his other son's. Name. That's in brokerage. Second generation. Right. They're gonna have to survive. What happens from a technology perspective. And so, again, these are some of the things that I just. I need help thinking through some of this because. And you're the person that comes to mind the most, and I'm not pushing you. Again, it's not even something we totally have to offer at this exact moment. I'm just planting the seed. Cool. Okay, well, great. Awesome. I will pull that document out and take a look because I never, never really did look at it when I signed on. But I will because it gets referenced from time to time when other people do things. But awesome call. Thanks. Sorry for going over. Thank you for your time. Okay? Awesome. I'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye. Great. Bye.
