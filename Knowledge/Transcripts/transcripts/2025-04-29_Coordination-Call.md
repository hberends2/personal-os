# Transcript for: Coordination Call

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:32:47.312Z)

Howard, should we go back through some of the systems and kind of what you've put together from a team perspective for us to operate or would it be better to have Vinod and Drew and you kind of walk through the progress we've made on the proof of concept over the past week.

### You (2025-04-29T17:33:03.195Z)

Yeah. Let me just go ahead and just update everybody. It'll only take a couple minutes, then we can jump in. So I think everybody's aware We do have the Microsoft account set up now. So Drew, I know you're gonna continue using your email, Mark was also set up, but he's going to he asked us to continue to use his business email, but I know at least for myself and Diane and Vinod, I don't know

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:33:33.452Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-29T17:33:34.655Z)

what you're what your desire is, but, you know, I wanna make sure that I keep all of my invest separate from everything else. So if everybody could use the invest email, that would be great.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:33:46.582Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-04-29T17:33:49.045Z)

So along with that, then we also have access to the Microsoft three sixty five And I believe that at the level that we've got, you also can use the desktop version. You're not limited to the the browser version. So if you want to log in to any of those with your Invest AI account, you will have full functionality I would also suggest, you you know, at a minimum, use it for the Teams site. So I know Vinod's already been on the Teams site. We have a channel set up. You can you can access your calendar there. And I do have a files setup. In fact, you know what? Better buddy, why don't I just go ahead and bring that up real quick and just kinda show you, what it is that that I've got set up, give you a quick tour.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:34:43.602Z)

Yeah. I might I might use

### You (2025-04-29T17:34:43.825Z)

Only take about a minute. Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:34:45.922Z)

and I might use my InVEST email as well. What's

### You (2025-04-29T17:34:49.965Z)

Well,

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:34:50.102Z)

I can't remember how to set that up. You have to send me a link? Yep. I can send you I I I am the one with all, like, my credit card information in there. So I can set you up, but, if it's alright, we're all paying for our own account, which is a dollars a year.

### You (2025-04-29T17:35:05.575Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:35:07.532Z)

Just because we're we're so slow on cash. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Great. Then I'll set you up, Drew. And then I'll just I'll send you my Venmo account, and and then you'll get a link from GoDaddy to set up email. Alright. Is it it's like just the lowest level of because it's not the Microsoft license. That's just for the It's the business it's the business what would you call it, package? Yeah. With advanced security Alright. I wonder if because what I what I really wanna be able to do is access the t like, not Teams, but the, like, the one because we're gonna save files on

### You (2025-04-29T17:35:52.725Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:35:55.832Z)

there. Right? Right. Yeah. I wanna make sure I can access that. Maybe if once we get stuff saved up there, then somebody you know, some trouble, will send around, like, a link, and I can just get it that way and see if I can

### You (2025-04-29T17:36:07.755Z)

And and let me

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:36:08.982Z)

sync it to my desktop that way.

### You (2025-04-29T17:36:10.575Z)

look and see. I I can probably add you to the team.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:36:10.692Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-29T17:36:14.175Z)

As a guest. And be able to provide access there. I don't I don't think you have

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:36:17.382Z)

Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-04-29T17:36:20.225Z)

to have the Invest AI account to do that. So yeah. Let me check-in. Okay. So what I'm doing, sharing my screen now.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:36:27.232Z)

Let me try that.

### You (2025-04-29T17:36:30.365Z)

And, you can set the layout however you want. You know, I like dark mode, but, if you wanna change it, etcetera. But you'll see over here, I've got you know, we've got the chats set up. Vinod and I have already exchanged some chats, so I know that's working. But most importantly down here, Diane created the Invest AI team. And, by default you've got the general channel on that and this is where you can make posts and everything, but this is where we also save the files. So if you navigate to the general tab for that Invest AI, you can see I've already gone through and created some folders. And, like, on the valuation model, I've got some subfolders and separated by all of the sample docs that Diane sent. Some miscellaneous folders or models, etcetera. So you know, you guys have the ability to create folders and and and everything yourself too. So don't think that you know, whatever I've got set up here is the way it has to be. By default, do it does come with a OneNote folder as well. I used to use that a lot. Personally, I'm I'm kinda deep into the Apple notes right now. So we can consider using both. So if you wanna use this for a general note taking, if you're familiar with OneNote, it's actually a very good tool. I used it for many, many, many years and only recently switched over to the the Apple Notes. And that's mainly for personal things. So I have no objection here to creating some different pages and everything if we wanna keep track in notes, meeting notes, etcetera. And if you're not familiar with with the team site, there's a lot of things you can add over here. So if you click on add a tab, you'll see how these options up here. You can choose some more, some what I did is I did add a tab for the invest Trello board. So one of the things that I think everybody also knows is I did create the Atlassian account we can it it's basically free for up to five users. So we basically are right at that limit. We have a Jira account. We have a Confluence. And with Confluence, you also get Trello and Loom included with that. So so now we do have an actual InBestAI Trello board here, and this is just one that I started to to put together where it's kind of an ideal list. And you know, kind of taking a high level road map rather than the gander ever. You know, I've got it separated into now and next and later buckets. You know? So I was encouraging and I wanna, you know, mention to Vinod and Drew yourself that any idea, not this isn't just for version one This could be something we wanna do three years out, but any idea, go ahead and add it here. And then we'll go through as a team, review some of the ideas, and then we'll determine is something we wanna do right away. Do we wanna do it next? We just put it for later? Or, you know, sometimes we're just gonna say, no. We're not gonna do that, and then we can add it to the will not do box. But this is and then, obviously, once we start talking to clients. And prospects, and they say, wow. You know, this is great, but I wish it had this. You know? Just add it to the list. That's all we need to do. So and, also, it does have a whiteboard function, which is meh. I mean, it's not nearly as robust as Miro or Lucid or anything else. But since it integrates into here, you know, we could easily create some whiteboards. I started to work on one in confluence. I'll probably bring it over here, which is just kind of a high level workflow and then we can all kinda get in here and and determine you know, the best way to do that. So basically, that's where we stand. You know, I don't need to get into Jira or and Confluence now. You know, we're still kind of setting everything up. So Jira will be primarily Vinod's playground. And and I'll be working with him on that. Confluence, if you're not familiar with it, is more of a just a a general collaboration documentation site where you can up upload documents, but you can also create pages and really, really useful for, like, customer service type applications as well. So anyway, if you have any questions, if you're having any difficulty accessing anything, just let me know. But feel free to go ahead if you wanna create a different channel in here. You know, you can create private channels. So if you wanted to have something that's relative or related to a specific function, you know, you wanted to have that there. Feel free. So Yeah. Vinod.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:41:52.962Z)

And then great. And then going back one more time. So want to Oh, breaking. So I think Diana and me were at the same time. Diana, you want to go ahead? You go first, Vinod. Please. Okay. Sorry. I was breaking the Yeah. Maybe some Internet connection issue. So what I wanted to say is if you could have, like, Teams on your mobile or somewhere which is accessible. Because sometimes, you know,

### You (2025-04-29T17:42:15.465Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:42:19.172Z)

we might have questions and, you know, it has a answer. It can be answered anytime instead of just relying on the email replies.

### You (2025-04-29T17:42:22.615Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:42:26.802Z)

We could have things available and, you know, I know we are kind of available part time, but if we could have teams available, then, you know, we could respond quickly whenever possible. That'll be great.

### You (2025-04-29T17:42:36.425Z)

Yeah. But that that's a good point. I mean, I I have the Teams app on my phone and on my iPad and here.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:42:41.322Z)

And then I did connect Yeah.

### You (2025-04-29T17:42:45.155Z)

So so yeah. And and they all work. Really well. So

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:42:52.862Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And then I did add one document on conference. Yes. Regarding the database. I have I did tag Dion and Mark since Drew was not there, so I can tag him there.

### You (2025-04-29T17:43:11.505Z)

k. Great.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:43:13.232Z)

Yeah, I've kind of started using that for documentation. And then I would just close-up with so we make sure Drew has the right access. What what are the next steps Because Drew might be able to use Teams or he might need the full Invest AI, like, email package. So how do we figure that out again? Somewhat you're you're

### You (2025-04-29T17:43:35.465Z)

Yeah. I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna add him as a as a guest.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:43:39.362Z)

Howard, are you gonna add them to the teams? Or Yeah.

### You (2025-04-29T17:43:39.385Z)

And make see what see what he can or cannot access as a guest.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:43:43.392Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-29T17:43:43.755Z)

I think I think there's a setting where I can basically give them access to pretty much everything, but let me let me look into it. So I can I can take a look at it after our call?

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:43:58.182Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-04-29T17:44:01.495Z)

Alright. Alright. Well, why don't you go ahead, Vinod, and and update everybody on

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:44:05.012Z)

And I do have a hard stop at 02:30, so I'll be dropping that.

### You (2025-04-29T17:44:07.835Z)

what what has been going on between yourself and Drew and the database and everything there.

### Guest (2025-04-29T17:44:18.552Z)

Sure. Sure. So one thing is website. I hope you had a chance to look through that. Whatever edits you have, please see them across. I'll make those changes. Secondly, the first set of sample data that Drew had sent, so I created this script to kind of the data. I was able to do that. I created the database. I was able to insert the data from the Excel into the database. So that was good. But the second version that Drew sent, that is amazing. So that's very clean version. I think I kind of have made changed the database design based on that, but also the kind of a principle in itself. So I'm basing it off on something called a star schema. I'll have dimensional table and then I have fact I will have fact tables that's how I'm gonna kind of approach this data. But, yeah, the new format is really looking good. I'm kind of making progress on create extracting data from there. I I should have something by your day today. Sure. So what does that mean if from from in layman's terms? Does that mean that we're pretty close to being able to get data in and out of the AVM via just a digital transfer of some kind with Drew with the data loading automatically. Yes. So Yep. Right. Think Drew will continue delivering the data through the Excel. And then we'll have a process in place wherein we'll be able to extract the data from the Excel Drew provides and put it put that in our database. And then application will basically consume that data from our database into the application and, you know, we would probably make our models or whatever pages we have to make. Based on that data. Okay. Yeah. Get getting the data like, eventually, it'll be an API or something where the systems can talk directly to each other right now. You know, I just am sending data in Excel, and then I can load it It's more about getting the you know, once the data loaded, like, does it live and how is it organized. That's Mhmm. Really to then how it gets you know, how the user is going to interact with it. That's kinda what we're figuring out, what what we're getting set up right now. Okay. Yeah. One question about that data too. So the format you are providing, right, expect the other platforms to provide the data in similar format as well. Right? Or the the files that the users will be uploading on our platform. They'll consume similar set of data. Right? So Yeah. I mean, I think if we think about again, like, we've talked about before, but I'll just go say it again. Like, there's sort of two two instances where we're gonna two different ways we're gonna get data, right, for for owners that already own their hotels, Mhmm. They can it's very easy for us for, like, hotel company, you know, we can go to the operators, get the data in the same format, push it to our system, so that you could just keep getting everything in exactly the same format from us. You don't have to worry about interfacing with 50, 60, a hundred different operators. So that's that's kind of one use case. The other is where somebody just not own the hotel. Right? And they're like, I'm doing my sort of first first half underwriting and maybe I only have a a couple p and l's or, like, an offering memorandum or something. Right? And this is what Mark was getting at when we spoke last week where he was like, really wanted to understand how that scenario is going to work as far as getting data. I think in that case, it would be, like, at least for for the for the first you know, v one or for the for the MVP, it should be something like a a manual input. Table. Right? Like and that's what analysts do now. Right? Like, you do a new deal, like, I've I've done Diane's done this. I've done this hundreds of times where you, like Mhmm. You start. You're like, okay. Know, you sign the NDA. To to look at this new deal. Go to the data room. You download a bunch of p and l's, and you take the PNLs, you kinda line them up, and you start putting in, okay. Revenues, expenses, statistics, you put it all into an Excel, you know, on start doing your model. Right? Wait. So in that scenario, I think what talked about last time was having a standardized template that a user or, you know, or it could be an online form. Either way, but something where the user can take the data that they're getting in the data room type it in to somewhere, you know, man manually enter it, and then submit it to be loaded into our data call. That would be instead of getting the data from Hotel BIS because right, that would be in cases where Hotel BIS doesn't have the ability to get the data. They think that the way if you think about the life cycle of this, way it would work is somebody who's doing a a first like, their initial underwriting, would do it that kind of manually first. And then as the deal progresses and maybe they go under contract on the deal, then they're gonna get they're gonna get authority or or approval to get more data That's the instance where in in the what has happened in the past. Once they go hard on a deal, then usually the seller and the operator are like, okay. Now we'll give you you know, more direct access to data that can that can be pushed through our system. Right? And then then we would basically just so we'd have to kinda I guess, I don't know how that works exactly from a system perspective, but you would say, like, just gonna start getting more updated, more granular data. That makes sense? Yeah. From system perspective, we'll con like, we'll just use that ETL process if we already have some data, it'll just get updated. If there's any update to the existing data. Otherwise, new data will get inserted. Into the database. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And I think we light shift. Mean, we should for the MVP like, I think, eventually, we'd want you know, we'll we'll talk about ways for data to get pulled directly from OMs and that sort of thing. But I I think just, like, that's probably a future state just for the MVP, if there's a manual entry form, we can say, like, in cases where know, users can't get the data through the DELB IS, they can just input it directly here, and it'll populate the data the data model. When you guys were at Rede and you had that data you put date you put files into a box. Right? And then the box uploaded and Red IQ looked at the information and then populated the model with that information. Is is that how it worked for IAQ? Yeah. Same similar. Right? So user will come to the platform, upload their rental data or operating statement. Will put that into some document So can we do that here for I mean, it's pretty similar. Right? I mean, honestly, what they're gonna come with is probably nothing more than some summary p and l's, maybe a star report, maybe a few comps that they've heard about here or there. And I I think that would probably be all there actually. Coming with at the early stage. Okay. I mean, we can definitely do that. But whether we wanna make that as part of MVP or not, That will figure out. And that's why guessing we we hope hold off on Got mean, that's very doable, but, like, you have to set up talking about the difference between structured and unstructured data. From, like, an abstract process. Okay. It know, the the less consistent and structured the data that you're trying to get is, that, you know, the more complicated it is. So, you know, you have to set up kind of, like, one process for a Marriott p and and all the variations for the Marriott PNL. Another one for Hilton another one for Hyatt. And the system would have to, like, and that's what our system does. Right? It's using the you know, we have kind of one process for each operator, each system. Right? So it becomes very expansive very quickly. I think for an MVP, it's, like, just a not get in there. With that, you just say, like Right. Have them put the information in here in the short term, and that will ensure that it know, maybe they make a mistake, but they can just go ahead and fix this. Got it. And then in, like, one of the first true versions, right, where we're starting to put real functionality and then we would work on that functionality. Yeah. That would improve. Yeah. Yeah. We can manage. Okay. Okay. One thing too. I mean, when I envision this, Mark and I talked about this. I I I mean, he's He we really do need to walk through, like, the data process with him a little bit more. But every acquisition is also a disposition, someone's disposition. Right? And so when you are running a disposition, having to go gather all that information to send to the broker is a very manual, time consuming, awful part of the process. Part of the sell to the hotel industry is hey. Are you thinking about getting a BOV? Or, you know, let's get you look. You're you loaded into Drew's system. So that if you wanna do internal evaluations, if you wanna get BOVs from multiple brokers, if you wanna then, you know, not hold off on selling, but three months later, have the brokers update their BOVs. That we try to get sellers used to the idea that they can log in to Drew's system earlier and use this as a way to more effectively manage their disposition process. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah. And this this data is, like, is it similar data that Mhmm. It's all the same. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. Gotcha. Yeah. That that makes sense. So right now, what we are saying is we have like, the major source of truth of data is from Drew's system. Right? So we'll be just looking to Drew system for most of the data apart from what user is uploading uploading directly to our system. Yeah. I think go ahead, Drew. I say, yeah, I think in just in the short term, because we have a lot of data. Right? So, again, rather than spinning our wheels, having you try to understand how to get data from the many different sources, this is the the short term. I mean, depending on the like, yes. Like, think, eventually, the data model, like, what the data we have itself will be its own source of truth. Right? I I think, you know, it will pull data from that place. Yeah. I asked that question because then it is it makes my life easier to develop the system because I know I'm just getting one of data. Like, the data in just one format, not in different formats. Yeah. That's why I able to consume the data. Right? Yeah. That's why I suggest that we do this route first because then you could spend more of your energy on the actual actual Application. You know, the application itself and how that function because I think that's what's really going to appeal to Yep. You know, when we try to sell this thing, like, oh, that's what I want. As as long as you can do the other stuff, get the data that's kind of, like, table stakes, but it not interesting to anybody until it doesn't work. Right? So long as we can do the other stuff, you know, we can figure out the the the getting of the data from different sources. As we counter them. Gotcha. And then I also wanna talk about the market data and other set of data that you said you'll you'd I think, probably, you have sent already, but I haven't got a chance to look at it. So this is probably a very dumb question. But what is the market data? So yeah. So Is it web scrap or No. No. No. It's, like, the what our model here? Hold on. Oh, is it comparable, like sales comparison? It I mean, it so in this context, sorry. Let me just this one, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Here we go. Okay. So right. When we talked about like, a cash flow, right, like, the the inputs and outputs. Right? You have the cash flows, revenue, and expenses for the property. That's that's what comes from the financial table. Yeah. Right? That's and that's what we've been working with so far and kind of covers, this stuff here. As well as you know, rooms sold, rooms available, occupancy, ADR. The STR which is a bet it's basically a benchmark. Right? It's a benchmarking tool. And then the market data really comes in when you're doing this penetration analysis part of the like, part of the underwriting process. Right? So and and it right now, I think, like, we're we're talking about this as far as, like, top line. Right? Looking at how do you how do you underwrite revenues? How do you determine how much revenue your hotel is going to generate you know, this year and for the next five or ten years. Right? You gotta have some methodology to figure that out. That's that's really what the market data and the SDR data support. And so you let me go back to this one. I Yeah. One one one moment, Drew. So market data is future predicted data by the model. It's not predicted by the model. Mhmm. It's something we're gonna get. Okay. Gotcha. And it's more historic for the general underwriting, it's typically historical. It's like back facing, not forward facing. But then what we do is we get all this information from Star on the the the STAR report, right, CoStar, this car star report, sometimes what an acquisition person will do is they'll go look at CBREs, hotel occupancy and ADR projections by market, by major MSAs. They'll go get LNS' forward looking macro outlook for hotel occupancy in ADR and RevPAR. And they'll kind of put it there and say, alright. If CBRE thinks that DC is gonna grow RevPAR, by 5.5% next year. Right? For the metro, then you start to get more comfortable saying, okay. Well, we can do better than that, or we can do worse than that based on our submarket. You know, unique things about our our our smaller market compared to the broader MSA. Yeah. And and I I've mentioned this last time, but and I think I I showed you this, but I'll I'll I'll email it as well. Because I think it sort of hopefully clarifies. But this is this is Waikiki in Hawaii. Right? Honolulu. So in this area, there's I know, probably 80, 90, a hundred hotels. Right? And if you're looking to build a new hotel in Hawaii, you're gonna look at, you know, how is the general market performing. And that's what the market refers to. And then there's specifically, like, you know, all these hotels are not directly competitive with whatever I'm building. Maybe I'm building a luxury hotel a select service. Right? So you're gonna narrow down to a competitive set That's what's so the market is this first row here. The competitive set is the second row. And then, and the competitive set's gonna be, like, a selected set of five six, seven, eight properties that are, you know, most comparable. And and then you're gonna have your subject property. Right? So STR data these STR reports that all hotels subscribe to, they include the subject property and the comp set And and that's the data that I sent you in that the the data the the new data table that I added for STR. Right? It shows you, like, subject property and concept. And so and only historical. So you would kind of use that to fill in this information here. And this information here. This is the this results for a new construction, so it doesn't have the historical, like, subject property. But basically, you'd be filling in that information like, kind of for the historical periods here. And then what, Diane was talking about with, like, CBRE or Hotel Verizon, just looking at something basically, like, other companies that put together just trying to find one here. I know I have Here we go. Right? So this is a polished, like, report put together by a company that basically tells you, like, how is the market the market being, in this case, The US or you know, Atlanta or Los Angeles? Like, how is that market overall gonna do? Here's one for Nashville. Right? So if you're building a hotel in Nashville, you're gonna wanna know how is the Nashville market doing. Right? Or how is it predictive too? Is it gonna do better? Is it gonna do worse? And the data here corresponds to this top layer here. That I was talking about. And so eventually, if we have enough data, this is certainly something you you know, we could predict with looking at macroeconomic trends and whatnot. But given that there are already companies that do this, such as Mark, I you know, this this is something that I was talking with them about them providing to our system. We just haven't had a chance to incorporate it. Basically, it would I mean, here's the data. Right? So it's was it published? What year, quarter? Supply, demand, revenues, which just like for a hotel or a comp set, it's you know, available sold, revenue to calculate off ADR RevPAR. And it's by market. Right? So you could you basically, this this will just become another table. Yeah. And you and you can and so what the there's no this this this is not hotel specific. This is by market. I don't know exactly how SDR does it or how others do it, but I have thought a lot about this, and I would imagine that there's some you have to create a a relationship between the location, the property itself, and the markets. You know, if hotels in Houston, it gets related to the Houston market, Indianapolis Indianapolis market, and so on. You know, these these mark usually, it's, like, the top 50 or top 100 cities or metropolitan areas that are included in a forecast. So if you're in, like, you know, tiny town Idaho, then, like, you don't have a specific market. You're just gonna have to pick something generic. Like either US you know, national or Idaho national or something. Right? So this when it when we talked about user journey last time, this is something I kinda mentioned. It's like the user might have to pick what market they wanna look at. You know, we have whatever the next 50 markets are available. They have to pick the one that they wanna use in underwriting. Yep. Yep. Yep. Drew, this looks good. I'll I'll I'll go through the data you've sent. I might have some question. I'll ask it. On the email or on the next call, but I do wanna give other chance if they have anything beside this. Yep. And, Dan, anything to add to that? Because that do you agree with what I was Yep. I agree with everything. Yep. Okay. Alright. Yeah. Howard, Dan, you have any other topic? Otherwise, we we can dig. Deep dive in data for sure. But One question. So in the beginning, right, when initially, the users will have to input the information. And then in one of the first versions, we'll have what you guys had with Rede the ability to drop those files and have them uploaded into the model. But where does the data reside when we do that versus go through a Drew system? Are we putting that data in the Drew system, or are we keeping it at the Invest AI level? Does that make sense? Keeping the data. So right now, since Drew is delivering through Excel files, we are keeping that data in our system. Okay. Even when Drew will give us APIs, we'll still store that data in our database. Okay. Same is the case with the files. When the user uploads the file, we store the files and we store the data in the file in our database. Okay. Okay. Yeah. This is totally standalone. So, like, if my company disappeared, everything would still function completely know, I mean, you have to get the data from somewhere else, but, you know, you can still it still works. So Okay. Okay. And, Drew, you have, just so we have this is maybe one of the earlier things we're doing. You in your agreement, you have an automization language. Right? That that you're I mean, our industry is very comfortable with this. I mean, it might be a little bit of a push to get some people over the the idea of it. But because STAR and and all of that. And and you have you had any pushback from your clients? No. We have we have we have in our master of experience, able to use data on a blind aggregate basis as well as to share with trusted partners. So Right. I'm not sure if you guys are I'm putting you under that umbrella. Right. Right. Okay. Then to share with trusted partner, that might be, like, if it's if they want to share the information with the broker or right, a lender or or right. Any of those. Well, probably not that. That would be more of, like, they would have to give us approval to do that. To do that? Okay. You're not a broke you're not doing any like, you're not a broker. We're and so you know, there's a we're not an asset manager. We're not, like, we're not using your data in that way. Got it. Got it. And then just wondering. Would we require any sort of agreement with the user of our application who will be uploading data directly to our application. Similar agreement that Drew has with you know, the other companies. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Did you guys do at RedeIQ? Did you have an an agreement with the user on that?

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:02.665Z)

Yes. In in terms of data sharing? Or

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:08:05.712Z)

Probably have. I don't know. Howard, you know, any insight in that.

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:11.515Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:08:13.062Z)

Did their user have to sign an like, did you have some sort of master services agreement where

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:17.725Z)

Yep. So it was part of our standard contract.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:08:20.202Z)

the user signed something saying that if it came up into our system,

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:22.695Z)

And

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:08:23.282Z)

it could be anonymized and used and all that. Yeah.

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:24.075Z)

the way we did it is

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:08:26.532Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-04-29T18:08:27.105Z)

by default, they opt in So they sign the contract, the contract says, you know, you agree that we will keep your data add it to a aggregated and anonymized. Right? So we stress that it was anonymized. Can't track it back. And if they didn't want they would have to take the initiative to opt out. I think that's that's way better than the opposite A lot of times companies will ask you to opt into data sharing after the fact, and a lot of people won't. So, you know, we kinda flipped it around, and I think we had

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:09:11.442Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-29T18:09:11.645Z)

about 79% of all clients that remained opted in, just a few clients, did not agree to it. So so yeah. I mean, if and and the bottom line is that's that's another thing too. Is if they do opt out of data sharing, then they will not have access to

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:09:30.582Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-29T18:09:33.365Z)

any of those products that would require that. So we would just say, well, okay. Well, you you don't get the market data. You don't get this or you don't get that.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:09:43.152Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-29T18:09:45.185Z)

Which is usually a good way of getting them to remain in

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:09:47.942Z)

Mhmm. Okay. Okay. This is a really off the wall question, but it's for Drew. When you are working with Woodbine, Bine, who is your contact there? It it doesn't go all the way up to do you deal with Dupree, or do you deal with, like, and others over there? I'm generally dealing with, like, the lowest level people at companies. Got it. Got it. So I'm dealing with, like, at Woodbine, it's, like, Sean Kent Kennedy, is well, he's here as a VP, but, like, and then, like, Roquet, who's, like, their sponsor. Got it. Got it. Because I was thinking Howard I told Howard this yesterday. I've been thinking you someone gave me advice that's in the multifamily space, and she said, try to go after the family offices in your sector. Because they might for angel investing, they might just be more you you know, I don't know, less less dilutive than a true angel investor because they're doing something for the broader industry. So as I was thinking through who the family offices are, right, it's the Pritzker's. It's the Tisch's. It's the UROFs, the Rodriguez the Scovels are a family office. I mean, they they are in the right? Yeah. So that would put Dupree up there and would be someone that since he's already using your prod they're already using your product, I think he would be a person Yeah. Maybe we would wanna talk to about, like, family office potential. Yeah. You know? They have a they have an appetite for technology investing too. They've done some in the past and actually just recently asked me about whether, like, you know, some this particular thing they were they were like, well, we could buy it off the shelf we could create it. So and it was kind of a tech product they wanted to put in at all. So that's yeah. They would definitely be interested in it. Mhmm. Okay. Yeah. I had couple of items. So one is Howard was wondering would it be possible for you to create a feature in Jira similar to how you created for the mark and that should be focused around the MVP And then probably we could cut that into a smaller

### You (2025-04-29T18:12:07.675Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:12:08.602Z)

PBIs so that, you know, we could

### You (2025-04-29T18:12:08.695Z)

Yeah. I can do that.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:12:10.792Z)

track the progress and, you know, check all the boxes there. And that would be great. And the other thing I was wondering, Dion, do you need any help from my side or from probably Howard's side? Talk to Angela and mister and then, like, create PPT or some sort of video or anything. That Yes. Yes. That's actually so timely. Well, one of the first things I need to do once I finish my part time job work is to go in and underwrite a hotel with the model Howard sent and just to make sure that underwriting a model you know, a hotel from the ground up in that model works, and we haven't made any keystroke errors. Either Howard or myself I sent him the original model. But then as I turned my attention back to, like, the marketing and the fundraising, we were well, one, Howard is all already using AI to think about putting the business plan together and and playing around with that. It's really really interesting. We also talked about the idea of, like, one one of our big challenges we're gonna have is that the hotel industry the investment side of it, just in fairness, they can be an arrogant group of people. And they are not really well versed in what's going on in the broader real estate community. Know, products like Red IQ and the other AVMs and multifamily. They probably won't many of them won't know what deal path is or deal cloud. Many of them won't know what Cherry is or know, what VTS. And so there's gonna be an education that goes along with this very early in the process that like, look. The rest of the real estate industry is ten years ahead of us. We, being hospitality, in in in digital digitizing real estate work Right? So we're behind the eight ball already. Otherwise, what I think they're gonna say is what we're gonna get is, oh, I have Power BI. Oh, I have Tableau. You know? This is amazing. My analyst can do all these things with Power BI, and that's my business intelligence system. So Howard and I talked well, we were emailing a little bit back and forth how could we maybe use AI to put together a short video with some humor tied into it that could tell that story better than we can tell it over and over again. Does does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, that that makes it. If you guys need any help from my side, let me know. Okay. The other thing is the data that Drew shared. Right? Did you get a chance to look through that? Is that all we need for the model? Because if we have everything, then, you know, I'm kind of start I'm gonna start coding for the model so that, you know, we have the data and then you know, the model just picks up the calculations and I will check that first thing in the morning once I get my quarterly reports done. That's I'll turn my attention to that and make sure that it's everything we need. I'm sure I'm sure Drew has. Yeah. I'm Both underwrite the same way. But Yeah. Mean, it might be I bet it's it's all the raw, you know, revenues, expenses, statistics, rooms sold, rooms available, In some cases, there's, like, labor hours worked. F and b covers. So it's all there. You'll have to in order to, like, to to when it gets displayed, right, like, it'll be it'll be a roll up. Right? Like, there's probably 20 or 30 lines you know, in, like, rooms expenses that will get collapsed or or summed. To create rooms expense on the actual, like, when people are when the user for inputting their assumptions for future projections it'll you know, what they're looking at historically is the roll up of those 30 lines of rooms expenses. So Got it. That that's what that assumptions tab is. One that I said not to put in the data model. It's just meant to be there for to show you, like, these 400 rows and the data extract tab like, move all up, you know, on the output level to, like, this kind of level of detail on the level. This making any sense? So I can't tell if I'm rambling or not. Yep. It it makes sense. And then did you include the segmentation in that Probably. Right? Because it's in the rooms department. Okay. Vinod, did that make sense to you? Like, Yeah. Egyptian part, I'm not very with, but I'll kind of dig deeper into that. Like, here can I get just real quick and go back here? Right? Like, this this is not our month long. We haven't I closed it. This this model is similar to one, you know, that we that we're working on. You have you're projecting out you know, property occupancy, ADR, RevPAR. And then you're coming in and they're they're putting in, you know, ARC ADR RevPAR dictates, you know, calculated to to rooms revenue, and then they're doing food and beverage revenue and other operated miscellaneous and expenses. Right? So this is what? Like, a total of one, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 15. Right? It's like 20 lines you know, and then a few more if you add in, like, calculations for profit. Right, versus what I sent you is you know, probably a hundred lines. Right? So what I'm saying is that you have a lot more than what you need what I provided. So in order to, like, collapse this for putting it into the into the user interface. Know, rooms expense will be the sum of all the rooms expense lines in the data model. Yep. Yeah. Okay. And and then similarly, like, I did not provide average daily rate or RevPAR in the data that I provided, but that is something that you get calculate You know? Yeah. Yeah. And then in the model that Howard put together too. Right? So I think I can kind of extract the logic from there. Yeah. I believe all the calculations are in are in the model. Mhmm. Yeah. I'm pretty sure they're all in the model. So the raw go, like, the the raw data that I provided should coincide with the raw data needed in the model, and everything that needs to get calculated is gonna is already calculated. So it should all be set up in the same way. Sounds good. Yeah. I mean, that that's the plan. So once I get all the raw data from, you know, the data you provided, I'll kind of that in the database, then I'll look into the model. Take that entire logic, put it in the code, and then kind of bind this code and the data together and, you know, it in the model so the user can download it. And then other thing is we can build that entire data and the logic together on the application itself. Alright. Okay. I think I I don't have anything else for today. Does any we might be able to give everyone ten minutes back. Or we could talk about the of the IDs. I think we already spoke to Drew, so this might be reputation for you. But since I can see that data in real and I'm working on the database table and everything, so I'm feeling more connected to it. So probably we can talk more about that editing now. So one was that send society. Then we said for each property, we'll create our own ID, which will consist of the sensor's ID and the operating ID and all that, something like that. Yeah. The account the the location. So so basically, like, on our side, we get data from up from the operator. Right? And know, like, say, a hotel today might be a Marriott, and then somebody buys it. And then maybe they keep it as a Marriott. And Marriott runs it for a couple years. And then they're like, I don't like Marriott anymore. I'm gonna fire Marriott. And I'm gonna bring in a third party operator. Like an Aimbridge. Right? And so then you're gonna have a new operator, and then but but the hotel's still gonna be called Marriott. Right? You can do that for a couple years, and then, like, I like Cambridge, but I don't like Marriott I think Marriott brand is not doing it. So they're gonna fire Marriott. They're gonna make it a Hilton. And then it becomes the Hilton downtown, whatever. You know? And then whatever. And then they sell it, and then someone new comes in, and they you kinda like, you basically, like, the hotel, the physical building itself, other than renovations. Is not really changing. But the business the the the operating business can change significantly. Right? It can even change I mean, I in some cases, it changes, like, every other year. Right? So Just curious, Drew. Who owns the real estate in itself? Who owns the building? The operator's in the So hotels are unique, a little different than other asset classes, and that you usually have three distinct parties. Or four if you include include the lender. You have the owner the real estate investor, You have the hotel operator, actually manages the day to day business. And then you have the brand. And you know, you have some companies that do all three, Right? Like, some one in some cases, one company might do all three. But, generally, it's like Marriott or something like that is the brand. But they're not operating. They're just doing the marketing, you know, they're the franchise like a Starbucks. And then you have an operator, a third party operator that is you won't find their name anywhere on the building. They're just you know, they're managing the building on behalf of the owner. And then and then you have the real estate investor that actually, you know, puts in the money and you know, the benefits if it does well or suffers the losses if it doesn't. Then, of course, you have a lender There were multiple lenders on top of that. So we get data from operators. Even though our customers, our ownership groups, we get data from operators. In almost all cases. So it's a little bit funky because the operators are the ones we deal with. The most, and yet they are not our customers. And they don't pay us anything, and we don't pay them anything. And, you know, it's very much like trying to maintain a harmonious relationship with them because we we depend heavily on them, and and they don't necessarily depend on us. And so that make sense? That does. Yeah. Okay. And so what we were getting at with our side the location table is very one dimensional. It is you have a row, and the row says Marriott Downtown. And there's an operating unit like, ID, which basically associates with the accounting system. The operator's accounting system. Then we have a census ID, which associates with the STR data. And then there are other there's, like, TravelClick and other data sources. Right? But it's, like, one dimensional. That what we've encountered, and this is why you have we had multiple rows with like, for the same property. In the in the attribute table, the the property attribute table because basically, we started getting properties that would first, they were managed by Marriott. And then Marriott no longer managed it. It got managed by somebody else. Maybe you know, maybe by a third party operator, or maybe it was managed by, like, Davidson, because where I used to work as a manager. Right? And then know, Dave Davidson got fired and and Cambridge came in or HEI all these different operators. Right? So they have different accounting systems. You know? So, basically, same ownership group still owns the building. But they didn't like how it was being operated. So Yeah. They fired the operator, brought in a new one. So, basically, we would set up a new entity with a new accounting ID It's the same name. You would have, like, Marriott Downtown, Marriott Downtown. So then you have two rows in the account in the location table. You know, one's from the first operator, one's from the second operator. Yeah. And then, you know and so this started happening more and more. So we have these cases where you might have three or four like, separate locations You know? And and at some point, maybe they even change names. Maybe somebody renovates and it's and this happens happened a couple times too where it's like, it's no longer the Marriott Downtown. It becomes the Hilton Downtown or the Westin or whatever. So then she started getting and so again, our our our location table is just it's just one dimension. It's just one table, and so we ended up creating multiple rows that the user can know, view together. Know, generally views together, but that they can view separately if they want to. But it's not it's very it's it's I think it's it lacks functionality. If you like, get as you get more complicated. And so what I know that some other what I know that, like, some accounting systems do is they think it's like a parent child relationship where, basically, they have you know, they have, like, five or six rows. You know, maybe, like, you know, one's the the initial entity with the, you know, the first couple years of operating data, and then the second entity with second couple years operating data, and then the third entity Yeah. You go on. And then they have a parent entity that they can roll it up to. And so that way, like, for us, as we're getting data, we can as many sub entities that I get it. I'm trying to think of how this this work. But, basically, you've had multiple sub entities that I think the data gets the historical data gets loaded into. But then we also have a parent that is where the unique ID exists because the and the STR is this way too. The census ID from STR never changes. It could be you know, you have you have some hotels that are almost a hundred years old. And they've had the same STR census number for as long as STR has been around. And But not all entries have that census ID. Right? Because some of them don't. Because they they is in STR. So the sample data that you had shared yesterday, some of them don't have census ID. Does that mean they don't exist in PR? No. They they they do. It's just in the cases where there's no census ID, it's because there's they're a duplicate. So if you look at that that table, you should you should see that there may be one or two locations with the same name. Okay. And only one of them has the census ID. So Okay. In this case, again, this is why it doesn't it's not optimal. Like, if a property if a new you know, a property rebrands or has a new operator, we create the new line for the new entity. It has the same name the same, like, operating unit name, but we have to remove the the number of the census ID number from the old one and put it on the new one. And and know but theoretically, the other the other way to think of it is, like, it should be the same census ID for all of them. If you have 10 different entities, it should all be the same census ID. We just set set when we did it, we made it so that census ID is unique. So it has to be removed from the old one and put off the new one. Gotcha. Gotcha. Alright, guys. I think we are on top of our so Yeah. And then and then, like, I said, we'll be talking about more later. I think doesn't necessarily need to be like, I don't think it's gonna have much as far as, like, how the users interact with the data. I don't think it's gonna matter. It's more something about retaining, you you know, like, being able to bifurcate data historically if we wanna be able to to to easily, like, look back at, you know, data for our own purposes. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. One last question. Do we wanna have this call because I know, Vinod, you're working next week. So do we wanna push it back toward the end of the week or have it on like, what's the best time for everyone next week given that our schedules are changing. Yeah. I think we had that concern about the momentum that if we get the call in the beginning of the week, that will be better. So

### You (2025-04-29T18:29:07.755Z)

Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:29:08.472Z)

available on Monday and Friday. So Oh, I remember this now. It's right. So we're gonna move it to Monday at 01:30. Right? Everybody's available. Yes. Yep. Does that that works for you guys, Monday at 01:30? Yeah.

### You (2025-04-29T18:29:21.725Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:29:22.832Z)

Okay. And then we'll just keep it Monday at 01:30 from that point going forward.

### You (2025-04-29T18:29:25.105Z)

Thanks, guys. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-29T18:29:28.442Z)

Okay. Alright. Alright. Thanks, everyone. Bye. You. Bye. Care, Howard. Bye. I'm sending in the conference page. Alright. Thank you. Bye.
