you've been very Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:00:39.978Z)

Working on Homeless AI.

### You (2025-06-03T22:00:42.482Z)

Got some time on my hands.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:00:43.378Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-03T22:00:44.912Z)

Uh-huh. So yeah. No. I've been working with Drew to confirm a lot of the formulas Drew and Diane have given a lot of feedback as to what we should, should not include, what orders. So yeah, I just keep updating that lovable

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:02.488Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:04.252Z)

page Yeah. That I've been working on. And Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:06.188Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:06.562Z)

So there's I've got a list about six or seven items that I'm gonna work on tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:17.268Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:17.522Z)

Some of it some of it's cosmetic. But I want need to make the sidebar collapsible to get more room.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:25.058Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:27.042Z)

Alright. Few other things, reordering some metrics. That Drew sent Font size is a little large. Working on some navigation So not really anything new

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:41.338Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:43.142Z)

Yeah. But then Drew did give me some good guidance how we need to calculate the revenue. Yeah. And also the expenses. He

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:01:53.218Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:01:56.752Z)

he pointed out something yesterday that I wasn't aware that in certain items, it's a you have to use it as a percentage of the total revenue. Of everything combined.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:02:13.148Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-03T22:02:14.932Z)

Other things like the operate the food and beverage and those are all those when they say percentage of revenue, it's just the revenue for their group. So we'll have to I I I got a list from him. So I'll go ahead and start putting together some some proof of concept on those. So it's it's kinda weird because you can't get your total revenue of everything until you do the food and beverage and everything. Uh-huh. But at least that that's usually for expenses. He says it's not they don't usually use a percentage of revenue like your room's revenue. To get your food and beverage revenue. So should be okay. At first, was thinking there might be a circular reference in there, but now I understand what he means. So, it should be good to go. On that one. One of the biggest changes I made, and I think it was mentioned in that post that Drew put up there, but all we need to forecast the revenue is your occupancy assumptions and ADR. Assumptions. Those are the only two inputs now. If you take a look at the

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:03:33.608Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:03:34.632Z)

the page, the the mock up, you'll see those. Those are the only areas But each of those, you have the option of do I want to input the overall percentage, or do I wanna input the year over year percentage? Those are pretty much the same. But either way, it all comes off to be the same.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:03:50.718Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:03:53.952Z)

So Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:03:56.878Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:03:58.762Z)

What? Course. Course.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:01.388Z)

Of course.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:04.582Z)

And I do see you added that

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:05.428Z)

And I do see you added that

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:06.662Z)

IRR ROI.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:07.598Z)

IRRY.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:08.512Z)

COC, and all that on top. Yeah. Yeah. Calculating on No.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:09.408Z)

COC, and all that on top. Is is it calculating on

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:13.092Z)

The plot? No. That's when I posted it, I

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:13.868Z)

the plot? No. Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:16.202Z)

put a little message there that that's just a static card just to kinda show people how it would look. Or how it could look. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:23.908Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:24.542Z)

We we may not want to.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:25.448Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:28.702Z)

I know you've got some of those cards on the website. Which is Yes. Great.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:32.328Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:34.572Z)

But I think we still need something like that in the individual deal as they're underwriting because they they they need to make sure that they those KPIs can hit their minimum thresholds. So Gotcha. I don't think that's one of the I I don't think that's something that I I don't think it matters that it's in two different places. As long as the numbers are the same, they tie.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:04:56.358Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:04:59.242Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:05:00.588Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:05:00.662Z)

Be a lot easier for them. So

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:05:02.028Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good.

### You (2025-06-03T22:05:02.622Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. But that's that's really what I've been focusing on. So I know Diane and and Drew both mentioned that, you know, we gotta nail the revenue

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:05:14.578Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:05:16.212Z)

before we can before we can do anything else. So I think we're we're at the room's revenue. So we're good on that. So now after I make some of these minor cosmetic changes tomorrow, I'm going to start moving on to the food and bed. And some of the other ones. If you have a chance to to view the recording of the call, it might be helpful because we talked about the categories and and just how each category breaks down from the high level down to the minutiae of the various rows Right. And we talked about

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:05:55.438Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-03T22:05:56.882Z)

so you could have your departments, your your overall, so you'll have your rooms revenue, food and beverage, banquet, all these

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:06:06.948Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:06:07.392Z)

categories, And then you could drill into food and beverage. And it might be restaurant bar, room service, etcetera. Then the next level is where you can get down into you know, like, payroll and all the different expenses. One of the things that he mentioned is for our proof of concept, don't have to get down to that level. In fact, would be kind of detrimental if we even tried. But what he mentioned is for the expenses in particular,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:06:45.058Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:06:45.902Z)

if we can just show credit card expenses I think there is one other line item and then just have a third item that says other. So instead of getting done in every single line item, we can just show those too because credit card expenses are huge. I he he brought up a few examples where I mean, all of all those other little line items added together didn't even come close to just that one line item. So he thinks for the for the proof of concept, if we can just have we know what our total is looking up above or what our target is. Right? So what we know if credit card makes up this percentage, the other one that I can't think of, if it makes this percentage, then all the rest make up the difference as long as all three add up to a %. So Yeah. So he's he he he's been very helpful to make it easier So we you know, I I was afraid that I was starting to get into the weeds a little bit too much for a proof of concept.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:07:55.598Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:07:57.182Z)

So I think I think we're good to go.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:07:57.448Z)

Right. Good. Good. And then as far as that

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:00.482Z)

Good. Good. And then as far as that recording goes, right,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:03.818Z)

recording goes, right,

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:04.562Z)

where would that be?

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:05.578Z)

where would that be?

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:07.012Z)

You know what? I didn't I didn't even look. So let me take a look here. So under the

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:08.358Z)

What does the meeting come in?

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:11.762Z)

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:30.278Z)

Hey.

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:37.052Z)

Okay. I'll send you the notes. I do have the AI notes

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:37.838Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:41.242Z)

so let me at least send you those. Gotcha. No worries. And then you can at least kinda take a look

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:43.278Z)

Job shared noise.

### You (2025-06-03T22:08:47.022Z)

what was there in you know, we talked about prioritization and a few other things as well. So give you good idea of what we need to focus on the next couple weeks. So first thing I believe is revenue. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:08:58.658Z)

So first thing I believe is revenue. Right?

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:01.652Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:02.818Z)

Cool. Cool.

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:03.042Z)

Both. Cool. Yep. And

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:08.068Z)

And as far as that new deal creation goes,

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:08.442Z)

you

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:12.348Z)

we're not gonna touch that for the POC.

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:12.482Z)

POC. Yeah. No, I think we are. You know, we can just use the model that I put together, but I need to make some changes on there So

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:23.308Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:24.142Z)

right now, has key money which I wasn't sure what that was. That just needs to be removed And For that fifteen. Right? Yeah. Yeah. The so the property detail opens up that mortal

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:34.868Z)

Property tail. Right?

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:38.522Z)

And so down in the lower left, you know, when that that key money has to go, And then we need to have a second section where you can check

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:48.188Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:50.032Z)

all of the different other items. So food and beverage, banquet, spa, need to check those. And those will then determine what

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:09:57.848Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-03T22:09:59.722Z)

groups for the revenue and expenses will show So that revenue I'm gonna rename that to valuation.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:10:10.608Z)

Mhmm. Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:10:11.912Z)

And then under the revenue, then we'll have all the different groups So we'll have occupancy, rooms revenue, which is basically the the sections I have there. Right? So you got the occupancy. You can do your occupancy forecasting, and you can see the cells there. And then you've got the ADR all of that will go to calculate the rooms revenue. But notice up at the top, you know, you've got those cards as well as other other rows. Those are the ones that Drew and Diane think should be visible at the top of the page. At all times. Right? So what I wanna do is under

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:10:47.428Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead.

### You (2025-06-03T22:10:49.122Z)

where it says revenue now, if I change it to valuation, I wanna be just like you see, like, on that home page. I think we talked about it before where you can click on expenses and it'll just take you down the page. So we don't wanna keep going

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:03.778Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:05.702Z)

out of this page and having a different tab for expense different tab for food and beverage, go all along because that's really I mean, then you're the that's no advantage over Excel. But this way, you know, somebody could theoretically just keep scrolling down the page, only take a few minutes to input the things, monitor those KPIs at the top. Once they get

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:29.338Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:31.682Z)

their

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:32.148Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:33.022Z)

valuation to where those KPIs fit their requirements,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:36.928Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:37.132Z)

boom, we get done. So Yeah. Yeah. And you're We could probably do both.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:41.418Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And you know what? We could probably do both.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:43.122Z)

Could have tabs and just crawl in the So suppose someone were to jump

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:45.458Z)

We could have tabs and just scrolling both. So suppose

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:46.982Z)

particular one, Yeah. Oh, I love it. Just click on.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:48.478Z)

someone wants to jump to a particular one, they can just just click on

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:49.832Z)

Yeah. That's a great one there. Yeah. K.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:11:53.558Z)

on the Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:11:55.482Z)

Nice. And then, of course, yeah, you can take a lot of these and put them on on the main page that you're working on. So

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:06.338Z)

Yeah. Oh,

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:08.322Z)

Yeah. But, yeah, let me I'll also make some changes to that.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:10.548Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:13.312Z)

Deal or property details. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:16.138Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:17.742Z)

Yeah. So I got the Yeah. We're gonna we are done with the deputy one, please. Let me know. I'll just grab this.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:20.868Z)

Yeah. Yeah. But I assume that you're done with the revenue one, please let me know. I'll just

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:24.702Z)

Remember you did give me a couple days.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:26.428Z)

grab this. And I remember you did give me the GitHub page, so I I should have that.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:27.152Z)

Right? Should have that. So I probably speak

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:31.398Z)

So I'll probably

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:31.532Z)

I can some of these other components. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:33.258Z)

see if I can use some of these

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:35.122Z)

Yeah. You know,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:35.878Z)

other components

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:36.742Z)

don't don't take what I designed here as Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:40.958Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:41.352Z)

How it has be. This is just the back of the napkin. You know, we can we can make whatever changes we want.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:44.458Z)

Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:48.642Z)

So I do think that I can probably not I'm gonna be gone

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:12:50.038Z)

Goodbye, man.

### You (2025-06-03T22:12:52.622Z)

all day Friday, so I've got a couple days And then over the weekend, I'll be able to work on it. So so the revenue portion is

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:01.398Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:03.022Z)

60% done. And the remaining items for the food and beverage and all those other things

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:07.028Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:10.452Z)

won't take long now.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:10.808Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:11.792Z)

Because they're just you know, according to to Drew, he said, easiest way to do it is you just give them a choice. Do they wanna use

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:17.258Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:20.762Z)

you know, the revenue? Or do they wanna use ADR? So we would just have to have another drop down box like you see there for the occupancy down at

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:25.328Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:29.142Z)

the bottom of your screen, and they can choose whichever one they want.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:30.518Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:32.502Z)

Go through and and budget it. So that's gonna be easier to put together than what we've got so far. So I feel very confident we can have that here. Pretty quickly. So I as far as this revenue

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:48.208Z)

Awesome. So as far as this revenue goes, I believe this is

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:48.832Z)

goes, believe is this is one thing. In our portfolio right there.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:13:53.178Z)

just one deal. This is not portfolio. Right? We are not doing this at all.

### You (2025-06-03T22:13:53.482Z)

It's just a deal. This is me wanting to buy the Hyatt in Philadelphia. Right? So this this is just the deal. This is not

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:01.698Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:02.282Z)

anything portfolio. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. But I

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:07.588Z)

Got you. Got

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:09.272Z)

okay.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:09.978Z)

And okay. And this is all

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:10.012Z)

And this is all. Prediction future.

financial and then prediction.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:15.842Z)

Forecasting.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:16.098Z)

Like, future prediction starts from here. Right?

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:17.132Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:18.758Z)

Forecasting.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:19.032Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:20.178Z)

Okay. Okay. Cool.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:21.882Z)

Okay. Okay. Yeah. This this makes sense. Sorry. I I take that.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:25.518Z)

Okay. Okay. Yeah. I mean, this this makes sense.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:27.432Z)

First as soon as that is ready.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:28.808Z)

Yeah, I'll I'll take that first.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:29.632Z)

To. Okay. Yeah. So that

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:31.248Z)

Soon as that is ready to

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:32.492Z)

that's another thing too. When I talked to Drew yesterday, I was using Mark's

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:34.168Z)

put in the app.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:37.162Z)

spreadsheet. And he's got a he's got a section in there for all these other

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:14:39.988Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:14:42.862Z)

departments. So you've got the food, beverage, spa, It there's probably a list of, like, eight or nine things, and and Drew was like, no. Some of those weren't even in there. But it was a sheet where you manually type in and then put in the data across the row. So whoever was using that sheet wasn't using it just for those other departments because I was thinking, man, we're gonna have a list of, like, a dozen

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:15:07.908Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:15:12.262Z)

departments that they've that they can choose from. And it's really only gonna be, like, four or five. So that was that was a relief too. So that way, know, it's gonna be much easier And, of course, if it's a self-service, you know, that's that's another thing that you know, we've got the property type on that deal details.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:15:33.118Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-03T22:15:33.612Z)

If it's a self or not a self-service, but a whatever. One that doesn't have all of the bells and whistles,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:15:42.038Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:15:44.532Z)

then you don't even have to have that checklist appear.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:15:47.248Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-03T22:15:48.012Z)

Know? They can just click on next and take them right to the valuation. So only if it's a full service that has the restaurant and bar and things like that, would we have to have those items come up So Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:01.558Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:01.962Z)

Okay. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:04.568Z)

Okay. And okay. Sounds good.

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:04.932Z)

And then are also working on that.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:07.798Z)

And then you are also working on that food and beverage one.

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:08.952Z)

For that is also in problem as that. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:11.928Z)

That is also in progress. Right?

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:12.152Z)

So when I say the revenue, I mean, revenue, And then if it's the full full service that's got the all the other things, I'll have a section for there. And I'll make sure that the sidebar navigation is set up the way that we want it. And what what we talked about also is that beyond the proof of concept, if we do want to get down into all those individual line items, would just keep it on that page, but we would just have a caret

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:39.558Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:42.402Z)

and they can click and then you can see all the sub lines that make up the total. And if they really wanna get into the weeds and make changes there,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:16:47.588Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:16:51.482Z)

it'll be it'll be very simple change or, you know, something we can do. So we're you know, gonna design it for for that. We'll be ready for it. So yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:05.958Z)

Makes sense. Makes sense.

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:08.462Z)

progress for sure.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:09.348Z)

I think

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:09.382Z)

Yeah. So I think timeline wise,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:10.218Z)

make a lot of progress for sure.

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:13.772Z)

it'll probably be early next week when I get to the expenses. Maybe even this weekend. We'll see how the revenue goes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Please.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:25.408Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's focus on revenue once that is done.

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:25.562Z)

Yeah. First, that is you know, take this.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:29.978Z)

Pick the expense, I'll pick the revenue, and then

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:31.472Z)

And another thing that Drew pointed out is

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:33.458Z)

go from there.

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:33.942Z)

food and beverage spa, banquet. The process of the budgeting is all the same.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:17:40.678Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:17:42.192Z)

So if I create one, I can just copy that down and for all the other ones. So that's why I'm not concerned about the timeline. I I feel really confident I can have it. I hope by Thursday. If not, it'll be Friday or or Saturday or Sunday. But Okay. Yeah. So so then I can go ahead and

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:18:03.938Z)

Launch device.

### You (2025-06-03T22:18:05.212Z)

### You (2025-06-03T22:19:52.562Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So so I was trying to

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:19:53.248Z)

And then hopefully we'll

### You (2025-06-03T22:19:56.322Z)

So was gonna say Drew is out of pocket

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:19:56.518Z)

add some.

### You (2025-06-03T22:19:58.732Z)

Well, mean, he's he's in Hawaii for a class reunion. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:03.178Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:04.142Z)

But he said he can check email and stuff occasionally, but I think, basically, from this point forward, it it'll just be you and I working on this with occasional input from Diane. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:16.418Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:16.952Z)

So I think we're think we're in a good place. Well, I mean, Yeah. Yeah. I saw it was rescheduled Thursday.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:23.158Z)

Well and then we do have the meeting on Thursday or not? Oh,

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:25.872Z)

Oh. What? K. Sounds sounds great. Keep

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:31.818Z)

awesome. Awesome.

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:32.152Z)

posted. On the.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:33.118Z)

Sounds sounds great. Keep me posted when the revenue end up, and then we'll go from there.

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:33.912Z)

And then we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah. I'll at a minimum, just ping you on Teams and just kinda give you a list of what I had accomplished and put together and keep going there. So if you see anything that I'm putting together that doesn't make sense, let me know right away. So Sure.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:20:55.558Z)

Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:20:55.602Z)

Yeah. Yep. Because that's that's that's my biggest concern is I wanna make sure that it's in a logical workflow that somebody can come in and on line one, go all the way to the bottom. And Yeah. Since this is

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:21:11.398Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:21:11.812Z)

I've never underwritten a hotel. That's totally dependent on Mark and Diane and Drew to give me guidance on that one. So I wanna make sure. Yeah. But I feel like you feel it is simpler than

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:21:23.608Z)

Yeah. But I feel that you feel it is simpler than

### You (2025-06-03T22:21:26.322Z)

CRM. It is. It is. It's it's really simple.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:21:28.578Z)

CRE. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:21:30.942Z)

So yeah. Just it it it is very dependent on historical data, though. I I asked Drew, you know, how how would somebody do this if they don't have historical data? You know, because sometimes in multifamily, you can you can put together a valuation. And he said, in in hotel, you can kinda do the same. If you if you have third party data or if you have a bunch of hotels a particular area and you kinda know what the rates are and everything else, you can do it. But it's really dependent on the star report and all this other information. And once you have that, all you're doing is taking your historical and then just using that as a starting point and forecasting beyond. So because I I asked him also, what if a property does not

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:22:24.508Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-03T22:22:27.442Z)

have a spa, but they wanna add one? Two or three years down the road. And

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:22:29.838Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:22:33.122Z)

he said, yeah. That's that's rare, but

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:22:34.728Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:22:35.472Z)

it happens. And you know, because I'm thinking from a multifamily side, that's it happens all the time when you buy a property and you wanna add a weight room or or a new pool or something like that.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:22:47.458Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:22:49.312Z)

So this one doesn't sound like it's nearly as complicated. So Yeah. Yeah. So I think So, yeah, it it becomes Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:22:59.778Z)

Yep. Yep. So, yeah, I think we got a play a lot with

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:03.202Z)

Yeah. Generate different

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:04.388Z)

lot with data and

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:04.482Z)

report. And all that. So Yeah. That way.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:06.908Z)

generate different reports and all that. So

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:07.582Z)

It Yeah. I'm thinking once we get past that proof of concept,

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:09.548Z)

try and move well. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:10.972Z)

we can start adding

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:11.538Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:12.442Z)

a lot of of those types of features fairly quickly and easily. Okay. Yeah. It the the the calculations are very straightforward.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:19.688Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:23.802Z)

You know, it's just a matter of the UI. Making it easy for the user to get in there and you know, we gotta convince them to delete their Excel models and start using

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:39.338Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-03T22:23:40.342Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-03T22:23:41.398Z)
