### Guest (2025-07-28T14:00:27.707Z)

Hear me? Is that better? Can you hear me? Oh,

### You (2025-07-28T14:00:33.450Z)

There. Can you hear me now?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:00:35.230Z)

there we go. I can.

### You (2025-07-28T14:00:36.530Z)

Okay. Yeah. Happy Monday.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:00:39.030Z)

Happy Monday. What a weird

### You (2025-07-28T14:00:41.180Z)

Good weekend.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:00:43.780Z)

yeah. What a weird weekend, though. What was going on this weekend? Was it, like, it was it just because we now have the offshore team and there's so anxious to get going on stuff? It was like this push and pull. Right, that I just didn't quite get.

### You (2025-07-28T14:00:55.980Z)

Yeah. That that's a good saying to I wanted to discuss. So so yes. Yes. There they are eager to to keep things going. No doubt about that. But hopefully okay because it seems to be freezing up. On me. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:01:20.780Z)

You are freezing, but I can hear you.

### You (2025-07-28T14:01:21.220Z)

There's a leg. No. You're you're it's I may have too many

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:01:24.490Z)

Am I freezing on you? Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:01:26.660Z)

things open on my computer again. No. I I I can close them right

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:01:34.690Z)

You wanna hang up and dial back in in a second and close

### You (2025-07-28T14:01:35.240Z)

now. Let me double check and make sure.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:01:39.510Z)

some things, stuff like that? Or okay. Let me close some things too.

### You (2025-07-28T14:02:50.656Z)

Yeah. I think start getting a salary. I need to buy a different MacBook that's got more than just the absolute minimum. Let me see here. It's strange. The the things that seem to be logging down the are more like the Microsoft products, PowerPoint and Excel and it's like, once I close those things out, it seems to be working fine. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:03:16.071Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:03:17.936Z)

Apple probably has something in there that says idiot. You wanna use Microsoft products, then you're gonna gonna have to deal with this. Try using Apple Spreadsheets. It's way better. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:03:41.701Z)

User. My husband's always like, you need to convert to a Mac. And I'm like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:03:43.196Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Well, as long as you can hear me, I'm not gonna worry too much about

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:03:46.401Z)

but I'm already so used to a PC. Right? Like, I'm not like, all our products

### You (2025-07-28T14:03:48.486Z)

hopefully, it's starting to sound a little bit, may maybe not.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:03:51.101Z)

are in the business

### You (2025-07-28T14:03:55.126Z)

So, yes, this weekend, it was because we've got a couple of things that were going on. First off, there are definitely was, you know, a little bit of out. But Yeah. Yeah. Also, some things where the node. With ideas and changes. And you know, Drew's an email, and then and, again, I'm just like before, I'm I'm not pointing fingers at anybody

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:04:48.081Z)

there was also to knock things out, but then also

### You (2025-07-28T14:04:48.406Z)

in any way. But this is something that I have gone through. In every single product. Position that I've had. It's it's it's almost like the nature of the job. Right? Which is there there's constantly

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:05:10.291Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:05:11.996Z)

people who go directly to the engineering team and say, oh, I think we need to do this or I think we should add that. Engineers love to build. Right? So when you go directly to them, they don't say no. And because they are engineers, and not subject matter experts, Sometimes they don't know when it's a good thing or it's a bad thing. It's a good thing, but should we wait? And and that and that's where Moe comes in. So I did see the meeting. That Drew was having with the node. And was able to join on my phone and so I did hear some of the stuff that was going on and participated in the call But one of the things is in that email that you sent, it was a total redesign of the POC. It had tabs going across the top, not the sidebar.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:06:18.441Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:06:19.396Z)

It didn't include the key metrics that were stuck to the top. It included some metrics cards, but everything else and I and so I had to jump in and and say, no. We're not doing this. We've we've been reviewing the POC, many times a week for two months now. And if if if we wanted to design it differently, it should have been brought up a long time ago. And we can't come in now and make such drastic changes to it. And, you know, then I also mentioned about that we had designed it to match the workflow of the users starting at the very top and working all the way down from occupancy down to CapEx. And way that it was laid out in in the mock up that that was in the email was, you know, you have to switch from tab to tab. It was basically back to Excel. And so you know, after the call, I pinged Drew right away. And I I I mentioned to him that, you know, I would you know, really appreciate it if from now on, that all of those ideas go to me. And not directly to the node. And, you know, I did explain to him you know, the role of the product managers that know, I work with everybody on the team I aggregate all of the ideas and the suggestions that I get. Well, internally and externally. And then I work with the team to prioritize and then it's up to Vinod to build. So I would like to take a few minutes in our call today to show the PowerPoint slide that I have on the screen that basically shows the workflow, and this is what the product team does. So we've got our internal stakeholders, our external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders includes Vinod. Right? So it's not like Vinod is it's not like I'm trying to exclude him. From this and say, you know, just shut up and build what we tell you. That is not what what this does. Right? So all of these people have ideas. And things that we want to build. So then once we decide those ideas, it's up to me working with the node See? Two way arrows.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:09:13.611Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:09:15.466Z)

To prioritize these because some things have to be built in a particular order. Right? And that's what this funnel does is we get it down to what is engineering going to build next. So it goes to the node.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:09:32.911Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:09:33.566Z)

And we constantly go back and forth on this to determine features, how's it gonna look, where it's gonna go, what color is it gonna be, all of that stuff.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:09:44.831Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:09:44.986Z)

Typically, there is in product management what we call the three amigos. And we would also have one other group up here, the design group,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:09:53.651Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:09:55.276Z)

They are very, very important to this, but we don't have a designer.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:09:59.421Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:10:00.076Z)

So Vinod and I will do the best that we can with the limited design skills that we have until at some maybe we can get a consultant or part time or something, somebody to come in and say, no. You should have used this type of a drop down or you should have used this. Right? So once we get that, then this is a never ending circle Right? So we build it and then we go back and we get feedback from our internal stakeholders. They say, yeah. Thumbs up. This is great. Or maybe we need to change it. And so the whole process starts again. We take those ideas that they provide and determine

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:10:42.981Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:10:46.176Z)

what are we gonna work on. Right? So in a nutshell, my job is the what and the why.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:10:51.351Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:10:55.006Z)

The node's job is the how. But neither one of us work

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:10:58.711Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:00.186Z)

individually. Right? It's always a collaboration.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:11:03.961Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:04.756Z)

When somebody over here just skips through this process and goes straight to the node, that is chaos. And if it's not nipped in the bud, very early on and we allow that to happen then this whole process gets lost.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:11:25.981Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:27.596Z)

And and and engineering will build what they wanna build, which are the cool things

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:11:33.961Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:36.026Z)

the shiny objects, the, you know, the the things that they can show off with. Right? It might not be the best business decision.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:11:40.751Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:45.186Z)

That's the way it's gonna be. And the same thing can happen with our internal and external stakeholders. They may think, oh,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:11:50.521Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:11:50.756Z)

you know, this is great. We absolutely have to have this. And then they go to the node, and he said, okay. Yeah. We can do that. But, again, it's not something that we can sustain. And if we allow it to start now,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:05.411Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:08.676Z)

it will get to the point where there's no turning back. Right? So I did talk to to Drew. I communicated this to him after the call.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:18.001Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:19.016Z)

I couldn't tell whether he was

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:22.811Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:22.866Z)

upset or not. I I don't think he was. After the call, I sent him a message saying, want you to understand. I'm not mad. I'm not angry. I'm just

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:30.401Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:35.186Z)

trying to make sure that we implement a sustainable business process. And so but he was on his way out when I called him. He was like,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:44.511Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:45.586Z)

literally walking with his phone to get stuff done. So he hasn't replied to that, but I want you to understand

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:12:51.861Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:12:54.006Z)

what was said, why it was said, and I don't want this to come across as a stay in your lane. Let me do my

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:13:03.761Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:13:04.586Z)

job. Type of thing. That's not what I'm trying to do. I just want to clarify that there has to be a set process or building and developing this SaaS tool.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:13:19.641Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-07-28T14:13:20.606Z)

And if we don't you will you will never get a product that is market worthy.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:13:26.521Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:13:28.456Z)

Right? I I hate to say I'm not saying that without me, you're not gonna be able do this. That's not what not what I'm saying. But, yeah, you you understand. I mean, the are gonna get bigger. Eventually, there will be more engineers. We will have salespeople. We'll have all these different groups.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:13:46.281Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:13:46.516Z)

And if it's difficult to control now, it will be impossible to control later. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:13:55.411Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:14:07.216Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:14:14.931Z)

No. No. I I totally understand. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:14:33.356Z)

Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:14:34.901Z)

And the one thing I think maybe and and I'm sure you get you gather this. In that if there's a if I'd say there

### You (2025-07-28T14:14:39.726Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:14:41.511Z)

is a range of technical expertise Right? I put Mark on the low end because he's really much more of a business person

### You (2025-07-28T14:14:45.986Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:14:49.561Z)

I probably come next. Right? Because I understand business processes underwriting, but I'm not nearly as technical as Drew is who sits in the middle with data. And Drew feels, I think, because of some of the failures he's had with his own company and his own chief technology officer, he feels a great need to document things. Does this make sense? And, like, set process and, like, I don't have that because I've never been through what he's been through. Right? So he sees what Mark and I are doing, and he's like, oh, shit. This needs to be like, they're off on a

### You (2025-07-28T14:15:22.616Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:15:26.141Z)

tangent. I need to go get it. Right. Right. And then there's you. You said even more technical than Drew. Right? And so you're the product manager. No one of not one of us has ever worked with a product manager before.

### You (2025-07-28T14:15:37.076Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:15:39.431Z)

But as I've mentioned several times, I can see now how we would never have gotten far as we've gotten without a product manager. Right? It's like, oh, now I totally get why product managers exist. And then there's Vinod and his engineering team, which sit at the most technical side. So I think sometimes Drew's

### You (2025-07-28T14:15:54.696Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:15:58.151Z)

Mark and I and our inability to, like, get things down and writing very well, and he feels the obligation to do that.

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:05.456Z)

It it does. And it does. In fact, you you triggered a

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:06.291Z)

That does this make sense? So you and Drew will probably just

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:09.956Z)

very important

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:10.061Z)

an interesting relationship because he is the more technical of three hotel people. And but I'm sure he appreciates

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:11.946Z)

thought here. So I I didn't really know that that Drew was a very

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:18.031Z)

the product manager piece too. Does that make sense? Because

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:19.926Z)

document oriented person. So I need to show him this.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:21.051Z)

he's never worked with a product manager, and he as as many people have mentioned to me, like you and

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:24.896Z)

So every time that we

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:28.091Z)

Vinod have mentioned this and a couple other people, is that, you know, he's been in business for five years and has only grown his business a certain amount. Right?

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:29.106Z)

build a feature, in InnVestAI, not just the model, could be anything, we document it and it's

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:37.191Z)

By being a one man shop. So, like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:39.006Z)

you can find these. They're available to everybody. It's in the InnVestAI. If you go

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:41.131Z)

I think he probably could have grown his business much more if he had had a team, but

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:43.046Z)

to the documents under the development and product folders,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:45.861Z)

does this make sense what I'm rambling about here that

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:46.336Z)

you'll find a folder called AVM PRDs.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:16:49.181Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:16:49.496Z)

And this is what we have. So you can see there's a PRD for every feature that we have in here. So we've got the property details, market data, value etcetera. I'm just gonna pop one open here and just show you And these are documents that that I put together. And these are basically the instruction manual for the developers. So I believe I'm sharing my screen and not just documents. So do you see it? Okay. So this is extremely detailed.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:17:22.361Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:17:24.456Z)

So it gives a little overview then it gives the what's called the requirements and acceptance criteria. This is every button, every input on these pages are documented here.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:17:36.251Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:17:38.906Z)

So you can see this is for the the valuation. Page. On that valuation page, we're gonna have those five key metrics at the top. You know, the IR or displays as a percentage with one decimal places. I mean, it gets down into the minutiae. Of everything on here. Then it's talking about the acquisitions inputs,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:17:59.451Z)

Yep. You are.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:01.466Z)

about all of those inputs on the left hand side. There's a screenshot,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:18:02.661Z)

Yep. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:05.506Z)

Then we go down to the financing assumptions. There's a screenshot. So so you can see this is this is what I've been working on the documentation and so what happens now is Raj and Shivon will get in here

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:18:18.601Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:21.186Z)

and when they start working on it, they'll say, okay. This is what it's gonna look like. These are the inputs. This is it's called equity

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:18:27.271Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:29.496Z)

and here's the inputs, and it has the calculations in here. This is their like I said, this is their instructions, their instruction manual to build this. So I I will

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:18:37.531Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:42.006Z)

point this out to Drew. And and let him know. And this is just part of the job, so I'm not complaining. But I just you know, anytime we make a change,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:18:51.251Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:18:55.326Z)

Yeah. If if we make one little change on here, you know, we have to make sure that it's documented on here. And changed. Sorry. So, again, that's why I need to be involved with any of this. Because if somebody goes directly to the node

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:06.911Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:10.176Z)

says, for node, can you do this?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:13.011Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:13.156Z)

And he does. And it doesn't get documented here. The the whole idea of this is what happens

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:17.601Z)

Instructions. Right? This is their instructions. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:21.626Z)

two or three years from now? Raj and and

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:25.591Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:27.196Z)

Shivang have moved on to another job. We've got another developer in here, and we ask them to make a change to this page. And he has no idea.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:37.361Z)

It's tedious. Right? Yeah. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:38.296Z)

How it was built. Right? This is also then

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:19:44.251Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:19:44.286Z)

that new developer have to come in here and say, oh, okay. I see. I see this. This is how it's done. I I get it. If we miss anything, if we don't add those things in there, you know, it it just has pretty severe downstream. And in Rede was a nightmare. Because it was started by two guys who built an Excel model and a data extraction tool, and they weren't product managers. They were investors. Nothing was documented.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:20:13.741Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:20:17.916Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:20:18.691Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:20:18.986Z)

we basically anytime we had to do something, we had to reverse engineer all sorts of stuff. And what could have been a quick two hour jobs took two weeks. Right? So so so, yeah, I I I just don't yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:20:35.921Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:20:39.226Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:20:59.411Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:10.376Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:11.481Z)

Mhmm. So, Howard, how will it work? Because

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:13.936Z)

Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:17.881Z)

I totally get all of this, and you'll probably end up just

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:19.226Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. That's that's that's business as usual. And that's why I've

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:21.621Z)

having more of a a detailed, like, you know, one on ones with because and I think he's gonna love having a

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:25.776Z)

all along been cautioning when when I go through the POC and somebody

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:29.221Z)

product manager once he gets used to it. And he feels

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:30.746Z)

oh, we should add this or

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:32.391Z)

such an obligation because on the hotel side, he's the hotel person that is the most

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:32.716Z)

change that. Some of those items we're gonna change right back.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:37.651Z)

most detailed. Right? And

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:39.176Z)

Or change completely because how we perceive

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:40.731Z)

but how does it work? Because this one this weekend, I did get a little scared about the idea when the node said once we code it, it's really

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:45.196Z)

that it should be done doesn't always match what our users are gonna do.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:48.641Z)

we're gonna need user feedback. Right? So whatever we build, it's gonna

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:49.016Z)

Right. So now it's not something where you're gonna no. Nobody's gonna come in and say, oh, I think

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:53.161Z)

require us to go back at some point and start to

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:55.966Z)

this orange should be green.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:21:56.661Z)

the user feedback. Right? Is that gonna be okay, right, with the with

### You (2025-07-28T14:21:57.946Z)

You know, it's it never gets to that, but you know, we we could be

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:01.541Z)

how the engineering team is going about this?

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:03.496Z)

totally missing something, which we know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:04.321Z)

Yeah. Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:06.106Z)

you know, we're not getting down into the line item details of food and beverage and and other operated. Right? And we know that we have to add stuff like that, but there could be some other calculations or somebody

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:21.881Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:22.206Z)

out there in their model has something that they do that nobody else does. And it might be awesome. Right? And they may say, you know, if you can add this into your model,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:32.111Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:34.626Z)

you know, then then that's the type of thing that we'll do. And so we know that that's gonna happen.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:38.051Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:40.996Z)

We hope it's gonna happen. I mean, if if people look at the model and say, yeah, it's pretty good. And then they never call back. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:50.161Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:50.646Z)

They're not interested in in using the model. They're just gonna keep using what they've got. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:22:55.221Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:22:56.486Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and we can't create a custom model for every client. Right? So somebody might say, oh, I you know, I don't want it called other operated. I want it to called other department.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:12.481Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:15.646Z)

Well, you know what? 70% of the people like it this way and 30% like it the way you want it. Yeah, I think we'll probably just keep it as is. Right? And then yeah, there are better ways to phrase it, but you know what I'm saying. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:30.491Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:30.656Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:36.441Z)

Right. It has to be built. Like, right. It might might not be. It has to be the way they want it for them to be able to

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:39.466Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:44.241Z)

go use it, not the way we think they want it. I yeah. Totally get that.

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:45.406Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:48.491Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:54.216Z)

No. That was that no. No. That was Vinod. That had nothing to do with Raj and Shivan.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:23:56.351Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:23:59.606Z)

And and it's it's it's fine. I mean, it's I don't think he was out of line. I get what he's trying to accomplish.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:08.471Z)

Right. Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:10.876Z)

But oh, yeah, some of the things on there are

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:13.901Z)

Better value add things for us to focus on for people too. Right? That

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:15.186Z)

you know, you you're gonna hear me talk about KPIs and metrics. KPI is a

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:18.601Z)

so what happened with the whole dashboarding, I was so like, I wasn't ready for

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:21.806Z)

key performance indicator

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:22.671Z)

that. Like, it came like, here's our dashboard. And it was like, dashboard.

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:23.446Z)

It's that is something that is very important to the business.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:27.101Z)

Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm not talking about a dashboard yet. Right? We were

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:29.186Z)

And other metrics. But then there's what they call vanity metrics.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:30.601Z)

talking about the what happened with that? Was it just that the engineers had time on their hands and they wanted to accomplish something, so they jumped in and started to

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:33.866Z)

Which are things that we as a business

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:38.801Z)

build dashboards.

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:39.546Z)

would probably like to brag about

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:40.031Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:41.796Z)

such as

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:24:42.621Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:24:43.396Z)

know, maybe our data extraction. Success rate. We might be 98% accurate. On our and and then we put a widget on the dashboard that shows our accuracy rate. That's really important to us. It's not important to our users. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:25:02.911Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:25:06.466Z)

it is, but they wanna know what's important to their deals. And things like that. So too many businesses put too many things on a dashboard. And it's just noise. And and that was a good example of noise was what it was was shown there. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:25:28.841Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:25:33.076Z)

yeah. Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:25:42.031Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:25:42.166Z)

Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:25:50.321Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:01.186Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:11.021Z)

Mhmm. His is almost approaching it from an asset management perspective. Versus a deal perspective. Right? Like, when I saw some of it, I'm like, oh, this is what I would want from an asset management perspective. But we've already agreed we're going capital markets in, if that makes sense. Right? So it's like it's a pipeline tool first,

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:32.096Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:32.771Z)

And so those pipeline metrics are the most in deal metrics. And then

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:35.816Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:36.601Z)

once you once we cross over and people start to use our product,

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:37.646Z)

And don't get me wrong. A lot of the things on his on

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:40.221Z)

my hope is that the data's there. They have captured all the underwriting

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:40.666Z)

the on his example were good. And don't think he was presenting this as this is what I think we should do. I think he was

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:45.131Z)

and they say, oh, I would rather just use this for asset management as well.

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:47.236Z)

showing us what could be done, which is fine.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:49.321Z)

But our competitors rather going after the asset management

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:51.256Z)

But I also

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:52.341Z)

first. And so it's like how we differentiate ourselves.

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:53.476Z)

I I do think that when a user logs in to InnVestAI

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:26:55.661Z)

And I hope someday we get to the point where we're like, yes, our actual IRRs

### You (2025-07-28T14:26:57.876Z)

they're gonna come to the main page.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:00.471Z)

you know, are this. That would be like a I'm like, well, I was looking at that. I'm like, oh, that would be a dream to have

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:01.196Z)

Of which the pipeline is the most important.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:05.291Z)

Right? And I but I'm like, I feel like we're gotta go through the the

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:05.916Z)

Just like you said. Right? And then they can click on a deal in the pipeline and go to that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:10.051Z)

the, pipeline management and the underwriting

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:10.886Z)

specific deal, or they can create a new deal and go to the AVM, which is fine.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:12.951Z)

you know, building and that dashboard before we get

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:15.406Z)

So you don't wanna have a whole lot of metrics on that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:16.571Z)

to a whole portfolio dashboard with everyone's existing. Yep. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:18.426Z)

page because there's not a whole lot you can do at the deal level.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:25.211Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:26.256Z)

I mean, think five years five years from now, a deal that they're underwriting this week is still gonna be in their pipeline.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:32.761Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:34.056Z)

Right? And so are the numbers

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:34.171Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:37.856Z)

from that deal going to be applicable five years from now? No. So you'll only put a certain number of items on that. So that that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:47.421Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:48.796Z)

entry dashboard should be more informational and show, you know, here are the hot markets or here's here's the current average

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:27:56.781Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:27:58.096Z)

interest rate. Right? Things like that that are very generic and broad. Then you can click down and see. And then I think the dashboard should be its own destination. So you'd on the menu, there'll be a dashboard.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:09.621Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:13.766Z)

And what we should do

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:14.881Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:15.796Z)

is not we we we should have

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:19.621Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:21.606Z)

a number of prebuilt web widgets.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:24.581Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:25.746Z)

And let the customer choose what they want on the dashboard. And, you know, if they wanna see everything, they can choose everything. If they only wanna see three different metrics, let them choose the three. And go from there. Because like I said, we're gonna be looking at a lot of different

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:37.751Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:41.756Z)

users

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:28:42.851Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:28:43.266Z)

different different audiences, and what yeah. Yeah. So an an asset manager is not gonna see wanna see the same thing as a lender. So we have to have some type of ability to fine tune the dashboard. What they want, and that's why you wouldn't want it on the main page. So but I I I think we're good. We're good. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:13.301Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:22.016Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:26.711Z)

Mhmm. Types of right. Yes.

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:29.116Z)

Well, I'm I'm sure we will. I'm sure we will. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:32.441Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:33.086Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:39.971Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:40.266Z)

Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. Drew has been

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:49.231Z)

All good. We're good. We're good. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:50.916Z)

very instrumental in the development of the POC.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:53.591Z)

Drew's gonna love having a product manager because, again, he's been a one man shop

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:55.346Z)

He's been active in it. You know, I've incorporated

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:29:57.241Z)

for five years. Right? And so he has been duking it

### You (2025-07-28T14:29:58.746Z)

almost everything that he's suggested. I mean, he's

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:01.191Z)

with his chief technology officer trying to grow his product. And once he's

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:01.766Z)

he's very easy. He's a key player in this.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:04.931Z)

starts to work with you, I think, and see, like, all the documentation you're doing,

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:06.516Z)

And and, yeah, I just you know, again, I I mean, I

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:09.001Z)

that will probably

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:10.256Z)

truly was not mad. I wasn't angry. You know, I just wanted to make sure he ended

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:11.631Z)

don't know. I just think you guys will have probably a very special partnership because

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:14.866Z)

the process and

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:16.061Z)

yeah, you guys kind of match each other in, like, technical

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:16.756Z)

so do you mind if I bring these up on the call today? Not

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:20.341Z)

technical views. Right? Whereas Mark and I are really focused

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:21.166Z)

yeah. I don't don't wanna get in minutiae, but I think, you know, it's not just you, but I think everybody

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:24.021Z)

on the more on, like, the, you know,

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:26.136Z)

needs to understand who's doing what. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:26.391Z)

the fundraising and the, you know, the the

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:29.596Z)

You know, so

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:30.151Z)

rain making, I guess, of it all. So yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:31.226Z)

I yeah. I would appreciate it if we can do that. That way we can

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:41.171Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:43.086Z)

Yeah. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:45.381Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:52.566Z)

Well, I'm

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:54.471Z)

Oh, I know. I know.

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:54.936Z)

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:30:58.101Z)

Right. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:30:59.086Z)

No. Bring them up. Yeah. Bring them up and yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:06.396Z)

Yeah. So yeah. The only way to make it so that everybody be can be on the call would be

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:12.071Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:13.086Z)

very early for Drew. You know, we had our call it

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:16.991Z)

And how should we do this with the

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:17.726Z)

08:00 this morning, so I don't know if he wants to join the 5AM call.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:21.061Z)

offshore engineers? Because you mentioned something that I I just kind of

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:23.116Z)

It's not always necessary.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:24.841Z)

I didn't I didn't register it, but the time zone difference we have here

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:25.016Z)

So no. He didn't join. It was just it was just my

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:29.061Z)

we wanna start to bring them on calls, we're gonna need a set time

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:29.856Z)

yeah. Yeah. Yesterday was a call. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:33.251Z)

that works from Pacific to Eastern to

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:33.596Z)

the the India team, it was, like, probably 10:00 their time.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:37.831Z)

and you you actually called that out. You're like, it probably needs to be 11AM or 10AM.

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:39.426Z)

Ten or 10:30. So generally,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:42.801Z)

Eastern. Right? Right? Which is early for Drew, but as long as we plan it,

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:43.866Z)

the offshore teams who work with The US based companies will work

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:46.691Z)

he knows he can get up and join. Right? I mean, that's

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:51.206Z)

what we would probably consider the second shift, you know, maybe from, like,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:51.241Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:54.906Z)

03:00 to 09:00 or something like that.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:31:57.581Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:31:59.886Z)

Which in in that case, if we were to start it at

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:32:04.171Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:32:06.106Z)

11:00, our

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:32:07.771Z)

Oh, he was up at 5AM to join that call?

### You (2025-07-28T14:32:09.126Z)

time, it would probably be, like, 08:30 or 09:00. So at Arcadia,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:32:12.251Z)

Oh oh, he did that was yesterday. Got it.

### You (2025-07-28T14:32:15.546Z)

had a huge offshore team. And we would try to make sure that all meetings were

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:32:22.081Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-07-28T14:32:22.526Z)

done by 11:30AM. Which was, like I said, like, eight 08:30 their time. It's it's weird because they're eight and a half hours. Not eight, not not nine hours. Yeah. There's there's a half hour time zone in India or differences like that. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:32:39.211Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:32:43.416Z)

so, yeah, it's it's really weird. So I on your calendar, on Teams, you can go into the calendar's ad other time zones. So so what is it? Right now, it's 10:30 It's 08:00. PM. There, so what are that? Eight and a half hours, seven and a half hours. So yeah. So yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:33:12.041Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:33:14.606Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's true. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:33:15.701Z)

Oh, really?

### You (2025-07-28T14:33:19.576Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You you you you don't live on the West Coast unless you're a morning person. So I would never I would never survive on the West Coast. But yeah. So that's that's one thing that, we would want to use the asynchronous communication as much as possible, you know, video. Record something, and then

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:33:48.231Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:33:50.036Z)

let them review it when they

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:33:50.851Z)

And it's 07:30, Drew's time. But when you're on the West Coast like, whenever I travel to the West Coast, you just that's a fact of life. You just have to kinda get going and start to take

### You (2025-07-28T14:33:52.446Z)

get to work and go from there. It would not be very often

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:00.011Z)

six or 06:30AM calls sometimes. And then

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:00.056Z)

we would need an all hands meeting where everybody is on. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:03.341Z)

right? I mean, it it really sucks because but you just

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:04.996Z)

yeah. I think

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:06.811Z)

you just do it and, you know, you're with your coffee and your baseball hat or whatever it is.

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:08.856Z)

yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:11.061Z)

And you're taking a really early morning call.

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:12.396Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:16.141Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:23.976Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, typically, our communication will just go through the node. And Vinod can handle that But, yeah, to, the call this morning was good, and and that's really what it was. It was to introduce myself. I also gave a quick rundown of yourself, Mark, and Drew, to

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:47.591Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:49.856Z)

them who's who

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:51.201Z)

Right. Like, I imagine Mark and I hardly ever do join. They'll

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:52.616Z)

But one of the things that I have found most

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:54.281Z)

type of meetings. Right? Because we're gonna be off focusing on fundraising and, like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:34:56.446Z)

useful is engineers

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:34:58.801Z)

sales and stuff like that. Right? And maybe Drew's more involved

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:00.846Z)

write the best code when they understand the business reasons.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:03.321Z)

than we are. But

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:05.606Z)

Behind something. And,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:06.321Z)

other than for them to feel like they know everybody and that they're part of a team and that they

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:09.186Z)

if they know the why,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:10.751Z)

they know who, you know, Mark and I are and that, you know, we you know,

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:11.586Z)

behind what they're being asked to do. And so

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:14.861Z)

this is a real opportunity that it's not some fly by night kind of thing.

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:15.126Z)

I spent the first part of the call just explaining real estate, real estate investment. And how it works, and and really what our core job is that I went through the POC

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:25.081Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:26.186Z)

high level, so that they understood, you know, why did we start with occupancy and then go down through revenue and expenses And what is ADR? What is RevPAR? I think you would would send me a a PDF, like, way back at the beginning with hotel acronyms, so I sent that to them so they understand what it is that we're talking about. And you know, what are these you know, abbreviations and what what does ADR

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:35:54.221Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:35:57.716Z)

mean and why is it important? And so that's really what what the focus was today. So but I do I do think it'd be very good for

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:36:04.031Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:36:06.706Z)

us to schedule another meeting with with you and and Mark Andrew, you know, we could probably make it, like, 09:30, 10:00, which is still fine for them. That would only be, what, seven, 08:00 in the evening for them. Normal working hours. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:36:24.891Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:36:27.356Z)

let you guys go through it.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:36:30.881Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:36:47.286Z)

Yeah. Late August. Yeah. No. They're they're actually still yeah. They're

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:36:47.641Z)

Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:36:52.256Z)

still working on getting everything set up. And and just now starting to code the others

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:36:59.901Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:00.646Z)

So it will it will take a while, and we we internally have to test the crap out of it. I'm sorry. You're

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:09.021Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:09.696Z)

Sorry for my language. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:11.111Z)

Okay. Alright. Good.

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:11.836Z)

Before we let anybody go out, we have to do as many

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:15.261Z)

No. That's good. And so as I watch this, I mean, we really may have a real

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:15.546Z)

scenarios and edge cases and everything else that we can do

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:19.841Z)

MVP for people to test in August.

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:20.516Z)

and then we can have everybody else. So, yeah, I would say I mean, I was thinking, like, mid

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:22.861Z)

Right? I mean, I was just thinking about it, like, at the rate we're going, we could probably start to have analysts start to test this come, like, the second or third week in August.

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:26.416Z)

September, but but Vinod does think Labor Day is achievable. So I think we should be fine.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:32.421Z)

Or do you feel no. Do you feel no, we're not ready for that? Late August?

### You (2025-07-28T14:37:37.876Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and and that's a good point. You know? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:37:53.811Z)

I know. Right. We do. Right? I know. Yep. Anybody see it right?

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:02.106Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:06.311Z)

Right. Let's test it.

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:09.186Z)

And you make a good point too. You don't have to wait till it's done. To test. You can test individual features as they're done.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:15.801Z)

Okay. Okay. So we just set our intentions that August is build and test.

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:20.106Z)

So when they build the property details,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:23.711Z)

Build and test, build and test. Right?

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:23.816Z)

we can start entering property names and everything else and

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:25.901Z)

Build and test, build and test, build and test. And yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:27.106Z)

make sure it goes into the pipeline. And then

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:29.561Z)

The POC. Right? Which maybe some additional ever you know,

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:30.446Z)

that way, if you find something early, it can be fixed quickly

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:33.961Z)

small things, but we're really trying to just get the POC coded. Right? So that

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:35.166Z)

and then they won't be flooded with requests at the end

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:38.901Z)

that comes up

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:39.356Z)

saying, okay, here's a whole list of items that you have to go back and fix.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:40.411Z)

come Labor Day or right after Labor Day. If we if we've built and tested and built and tested, then we're in a place where

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:43.836Z)

So yeah. No. That that'll definitely help us if we can

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:46.921Z)

we could have an analyst test it. And it would look much better from a

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:47.166Z)

all be available during the month of August to test these things as they're developed. That's the best way

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:38:51.381Z)

when we start to do demos and stuff like that for people other than our friends. Right?

### You (2025-07-28T14:38:53.426Z)

to go. Yeah. Sure.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:01.321Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:04.106Z)

Yeah. So I would think yeah. Not even version one. You know, that I think I mentioned in there, you know, it could be a year. Before everything is there. But I was very well,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:28.861Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:29.306Z)

things. Number one, I I have an acquaintance that I've been in contact with for a couple years. He tried to poach me away from RedeyeQ to build another

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:40.831Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:40.896Z)

model I didn't

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:41.911Z)

Okay. Awesome. And you did some work on OMs as

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:43.586Z)

make I I didn't jump ship, but we kept in contact.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:46.561Z)

weekend. I was reading through your

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:47.776Z)

And he's done a really good job

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:48.831Z)

your correspondence this morning, but you I mean, that the technology is there. Right? But it's

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:51.046Z)

using optical

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:53.531Z)

it's won't be read this won't be ready for it'll be a version one versus a

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:53.646Z)

processing. So there's without getting into the minutiae,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:39:57.961Z)

POC or MVP thing, but that we're

### You (2025-07-28T14:39:59.156Z)

you know, the old way of extracting data

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:40:00.821Z)

yep. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:40:03.146Z)

from a document is called OCR, optic optical Character Recognition. And what that means is if you have a document that's formatted the same same way every time, like an invoice, or know, a utility bill, and you know name of the property is in the upper left corner, and down in the bottom you're going to find something called usage and amount and total due. That's how it worked. But if you uploaded a document that had a different format, it would break. Now they have what they're call what they call visual not visualization, but video recognition. Which instead of looking for certain characters in a certain location, it uses LLM and you know, you could have your total amount due in the bottom right. You have your total amount due in the center. It doesn't matter because it's looking for the word total due or yeah. Total amount due rather than that. And it's not just financial, could be anything. So now, you know, he what my what my acquaintance did is he is pre populating the historical data by taking a screenshot of the page. So he's not quite using the the technology where you can just upload a document and it will scan through the whole document to find that. He's taking a screenshot, but it's it's pretty much the same thing. He's just kind of doing a shortcut. And so he can take an OM, take a screenshot of the financials, and use that data to extract

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:41:55.651Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:41:58.396Z)

the numbers from the financials. The accuracy rate is pretty good. It's not perfect. It's probably like 93 to 95%. So, you know, there's still this disclaimer on the page that says, you know, double check the numbers to make sure And every once in a while, it might input something wrong, and the user will have to go back and get it. But that accuracy is increasing very fast with everything else that's just AI related. So I do think that pretty much all of those screenshots that I sent within six months to a year I think we can get maybe 80% of the AVM automatically populated. And then the user just go, and take a look at what's populated and just change what they want. So you know, just like you know, the the OM includes their own projections, what the broker thinks it's gonna rate. Right? The investor probably agree in general, but they're gonna tweak numbers that they feel they they can tweak. And it's a lot easier to go in there and just

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:43:18.541Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:43:20.576Z)

change a handful of numbers than to have to go through cell by cell and input. So that's gonna be huge. So so, yeah, we can get to the point where just by simply uploading

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:43:35.921Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:43:38.626Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:43:43.231Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:43:48.126Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:43:53.091Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:43:55.326Z)

Yep. Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:03.211Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:10.106Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:10.401Z)

Mhmm. It's also a lot of, like, practically, when you're when you are looking at a property and some brokers don't actually include

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:23.946Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:25.811Z)

projections anymore. It's something that is, like, iffy. Right? But

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:29.186Z)

Yep. Yeah. Yeah. That's

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:29.581Z)

what you what happens is you you use the broker's and then you do your own. And then when you're having conversations with the broker about the purchase price,

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:33.996Z)

universal real estate. Yeah. So so yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:37.991Z)

you say, well, we're not quite with you on where the ADR is because of you know, y, and z. So therefore, we can't get to a 120,000,000. We only get to a 100,000,000 be you know, like, you start to have those conversations back and forth about the assumptions. Like, I can't justify anywhere near what you justify it on this. Therefore,

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:55.116Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:44:57.861Z)

because then the broker's gotta go back to the seller and say,

### You (2025-07-28T14:44:58.696Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:45:01.601Z)

oh, the buyers are underwriting like this, which means they can't get to the expedite your ex you know, your your ex the expectation on sale price or even the expectation that we gave you from a market value perspective. Right? You I'm the same on multifamily. I'm sure it's it's pretty universal on how that works. Yep. One thing that's maybe not universal that I wanna put on your radar screen because I think we're gonna get asked this when we go out to talk to real clients, is one of the things that's always been a problem in standardizing hotel underwriting is the incentive fee. And we didn't include incentive fee in the POC. And, actually, not a lot of management companies are earning incentive fee right now because of

### You (2025-07-28T14:45:45.466Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:45:48.021Z)

COVID and what it did. But incentive fees, there are maybe five to 10 standard ways to calculate it. But a lot of deal people take great pride in developing a a clause in their management agreement that is, like, extra special or extra tight, right, that has some secret sauce that they feel that caps or limits the incentive fee. And so I I dealt with this at Clarion Partners. My boss loved to negotiate weird incentive management

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:20.706Z)

Mhmm. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:23.121Z)

fee provisions. And so it would take everyone

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:25.446Z)

We we can do that now. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:26.711Z)

crowding around the management agreement, reading, rereading, rereading the incentive meet

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:27.886Z)

well, not the calculation, but yeah, we can we can provide a

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:31.411Z)

Does this make sense in order to actually model it?

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:32.986Z)

a service, and and I think we should. I think Archer's doing that.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:34.971Z)

So we may need as you're thinking about this

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:37.616Z)

And some other ones.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:38.231Z)

video recognition, right, we may need to be actually to

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:39.926Z)

That you can upload any document. You can upload loan documents,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:42.301Z)

screenshot the incentive management fee calculation

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:44.116Z)

the management agreements, everything, and just basically have

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:46.371Z)

from the if there's an existing management agreement

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:48.006Z)

the the GPT

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:50.071Z)

Usually, this happens more with very big, large brand managed hotels versus

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:50.216Z)

break it down and summarize it for you, including, you know, like, even the, you know, partnership agreements. They can show you the waterfall

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:54.771Z)

smaller third party managed hotels. But that we can

### You (2025-07-28T14:46:58.096Z)

calculations, etcetera.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:46:59.231Z)

import it, and then we have a way to

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:00.326Z)

And I've always wanted to do that as a separate

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:47:02.121Z)

get at is a a unique calculation method

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:04.066Z)

page in the documents section that just summarizes everything. And we could then say,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:47:07.651Z)

if it so exists in the management agreement that way. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:12.326Z)

if there is something in

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:47:12.951Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:15.316Z)

these documents that you want to include, I would assume something like that would be right there by the management fees. Have a separate line item below. So in the property details page, the second page where you can check which other operating things could have a very similar page that's with a list of those types of items and say,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:47:36.581Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:39.826Z)

do you have incentive fees? And if they check the box,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:47:41.181Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:47:43.446Z)

then we'll have that incentive fees line item displayed below management fees. And we just have to figure out if each one is calculated we would have to have a process where the user would just input you know, whatever the formula is. Now I don't know what type of things. I mean, if

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:48:08.431Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:48:08.526Z)

if you calculate an incentive fee and it includes something other than what's in the financial statements, Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:48:28.361Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:48:28.896Z)

Yeah. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:48:33.401Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:48:47.066Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:03.181Z)

It does because it's usually something like you get a management fee after the owner receives an 8% return on their basis.

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:12.416Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:15.701Z)

Right? And so you need to know what the bay and the basis is typically spelled out

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:16.356Z)

Okay. We would just have to design a thing. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:19.711Z)

in the management agreement.

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:20.986Z)

know, that's that's the nice thing with GPT is you don't have to

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:21.601Z)

But it can be added to over time if

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:24.396Z)

I mean, you could just describe

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:25.131Z)

an owner spends money above the FF and E reserve.

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:26.736Z)

what it is you need.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:28.721Z)

So sometimes you actually have to get from the seller, like, what the

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:29.026Z)

And you know, then it could design a form

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:32.921Z)

you know, the basis is so that you can calculate it.

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:33.096Z)

that says, you know, here are the inputs

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:36.931Z)

But, again, that it's really mostly for, like, the big brand managed

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:38.046Z)

that are required to calculate this and then

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:41.031Z)

hotels where management goes with the deal.

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:41.766Z)

you know, we could potentially just have the user then populate those inputs.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:44.051Z)

Because if management is just starting with the deal, then

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:46.306Z)

But it would I mean, this this would be

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:47.911Z)

it gets negotiated as part of that new management agreement. It's it's typically

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:49.806Z)

fairly complicated. But it's doable. It's just

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:52.821Z)

something along the lines of of, like, 20% above eight or

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:54.966Z)

know, we just have to decide you know, how how many

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:49:57.491Z)

10% return on. That's the most typical

### You (2025-07-28T14:49:59.776Z)

right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:00.841Z)

But there are weird ones that exist out there. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:06.176Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:12.291Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:18.906Z)

Yeah. Done. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:37.861Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:39.036Z)

Yeah. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:42.261Z)

It's rare. I mean, I I don't wanna say if

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:44.856Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:46.361Z)

it's it's it's like you could almost, like, say, you know, if it's coming if it's, like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:48.506Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:50.701Z)

the Ritz Carlton Boca Raton. Right?

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:51.086Z)

Well, the the good news is that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:53.931Z)

You can almost and then Ritz Ritz is getting

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:55.266Z)

using tools like ChatGPT, Claude,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:50:57.441Z)

it's Ritz stays in management as part of the deal. You can almost say to the

### You (2025-07-28T14:50:59.576Z)

whatever, makes it

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:02.411Z)

right in the logic, it's like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:03.246Z)

easier than ever before.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:04.521Z)

oh, this is a brand managed hotel. Therefore, I need to think about the incentive fee.

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:05.816Z)

But the thing we need to consider with every change, no matter what it is, there there is a cost involved.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:09.311Z)

Harder. Right? It's like I need to go search through the managed agreement and find incentive fee and pull out that provision.

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:14.306Z)

So AI has greatly reduced the cost because it's reduced

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:17.721Z)

And then

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:18.646Z)

the amount of time between

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:19.581Z)

and, you know, like RedIQ, maybe that takes, like, maybe

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:20.686Z)

start and finish.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:23.501Z)

well, I don't know. We'll figure it out. I'm sure that it's it's completely doable at this point.

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:23.976Z)

But, you know, every hour that I work on something, hour that you work on something, every meeting that we have,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:27.961Z)

I wanted to bring it up more because I think people would bring it up to us as, like, a challenge

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:30.466Z)

you know, every hour that the engineers work on this,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:32.931Z)

know, like, oh, but incentive fees can be a bitch. How are you guys gonna deal with that?

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:33.886Z)

it it's it's a cost. It's an expense. Yeah. So, you know, sometimes we're gonna have to determine, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:37.541Z)

And yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:39.356Z)

are we going to get additional revenue

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:51:39.431Z)

Anyway, so

### You (2025-07-28T14:51:42.086Z)

from this from this request? If so, is it going to be enough to offset our costs, not only of developing it, but are we gonna have to maintain anything? And and that's the thing people don't realize with AI is that it changes so fast that your yeah. Your model may might break if OpenAI changes something or Anthropic changes

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:52:06.031Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:52:06.816Z)

something and all of a sudden we have to now go in and change So it's not like a one and done. There's there's going to be ongoing costs.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:52:14.571Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:52:15.566Z)

But yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's all. I know we're going to

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:52:18.741Z)

Impacts our profitability. Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T14:52:18.946Z)

a deep dive into product management here, but yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:52:23.651Z)

Yep. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:52:42.326Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:52:46.311Z)

How do you keep up with it? Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:52:50.506Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:02.381Z)

Mhmm. No. No. It's good. It's good. And then one other question. So the node

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:08.786Z)

No. No. No. I think he was

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:12.131Z)

email on Friday. I didn't know how to respond to that email.

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:13.206Z)

basically doing the same thing that I had been doing, which is trying to

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:16.651Z)

I hope I did an alright job, but I wasn't

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:17.406Z)

set realistic expectations of

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:19.681Z)

quite sure what he was getting at with the, like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:21.196Z)

where the technology is today

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:22.911Z)

the whole you know, just talking about I don't know what was he talking about. They were all getting very

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:24.086Z)

and how long it takes know, it's

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:27.671Z)

excited about AI, but we need to be realistic

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:28.226Z)

it's not just flipping a switch. There's a lot of things that need to be done

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:30.841Z)

And do you know what I'm talking about email? Which

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:32.296Z)

So my interpretation of that was, you know, when he was talking about

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:33.861Z)

we had just come off that call with Chelsea. Right? So I was definitely

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:36.336Z)

the timeline, it was like, you know, I thought he was

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:38.831Z)

about AI and thinking a lot about

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:39.576Z)

dead on. I I thought that was a very good email.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:40.901Z)

video, which what she said. But help me coach me through that. Like, what does that mean?

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:44.116Z)

So that know, it's like everybody's coming up with all these ideas of how we can use AI.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:47.211Z)

How can our team better handle that with the node? And

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:51.666Z)

We do have to be careful because, you know, there are hallucinations in AI

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:53:52.041Z)

his team on on like, did we get two over our skis on that, and we need to be more careful? Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:53:56.456Z)

and certain things show promise, but they're not quite there yet. And so we just have to temper expectations. That some of these great ideas that we're coming up with today, this list of AI features, you know, we just have to go very carefully through it

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:54:16.851Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:54:17.136Z)

You know, what can we do with high confidence with what's available today versus what should we just kinda sit on the sidelines while the technology works as way up and go from there. I think that's that was my interpretation of it. I don't I don't think anything needs to be done or said. I just think he was just kinda yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:54:47.151Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:54:47.876Z)

Right. Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:17.701Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:18.406Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:21.971Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:22.516Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:26.961Z)

Just making sure because I know, like, Mark's excited about AI. I'm excited about I was a little bit more like, okay. We don't need all these AI features for the POC. But then in talking to Chelsea, I got the sense, like, they're look looking at platforms that are really far along with AI. So she's kinda like, our platform is more right now of a

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:45.476Z)

And and that's exactly my interpretation as well. I I think

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:46.921Z)

utility platform. Right? Because we don't have, like, these flashy AI. And

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:49.956Z)

when when she said that there are some pure AI plays, I

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:50.811Z)

I'm good with that because we have to walk before we run.

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:54.116Z)

took that as

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:54.401Z)

Right? And the hotel industry has never had anything like this at all, so we need to make sure we get

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:55.956Z)

there are startups out there

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:55:59.191Z)

the basics completely, you know,

### You (2025-07-28T14:55:59.956Z)

whose entire business model is built on AI.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:02.391Z)

down pat, you know, and

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:03.026Z)

And you know, they can do

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:05.501Z)

error free, which is the underwriting piece of it.

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:05.616Z)

whatever automation they have

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:08.581Z)

But it did make me think about how we're gonna lay this out on the pitch deck

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:09.066Z)

whereas our primary product is

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:13.071Z)

so that we sit somewhere between we're getting the basic

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:13.396Z)

a tool and not AI, but our tool will use AI

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:16.571Z)

laid down, but we have a plan, you know, or at least

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:18.646Z)

I think that's kinda what she was getting at is just like you said, that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:20.401Z)

a vision of how we see AI coming in

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:22.816Z)

we can't have

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:24.281Z)

over the next,

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:24.486Z)

every AI feature available in version one. And she knows that. And I think she was just saying that, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:25.921Z)

well, over the the angel the angel investment period, which is probably you know, three years when it's all said and done.

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:31.226Z)

get get the basics in there, and we've we're we're doing that. We're using AI to parse this data. We could use AI to extract you know, certain features out of the OWN. If we're not 100% confident on the financial part, we can still get the text part out of it. There's a lot of text

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:56:48.591Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:56:50.146Z)

items in an OM that we can use, and so we can show that we're using it. And then as we go to with our road map, and nothing on our road map is

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:57:00.691Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:57:03.536Z)

new. I I hate to say it. I mean, it's not like we're yeah. We're we're not NASA. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:57:13.281Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:57:21.606Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:57:37.881Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:57:41.386Z)

Yep. Yeah. Right. Yep. Yep. That's exactly right. We're not

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:57:53.621Z)

Right. Right. No. It's not. It's not. Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:57:56.546Z)

not inventing something new. You know, this isn't rocket

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:57:57.531Z)

We're we're following the yellow brick road. I say that all the time, but we've got, like,

### You (2025-07-28T14:57:59.716Z)

science. We're not working on warp drive. It's, you know, it's

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:01.231Z)

multifamily AVMs that are up there that we're looking at. Like, okay. They're doing we have deal

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:03.276Z)

proven technology. It's just a matter of you know, what order do we implement it

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:06.141Z)

and deal cloud and term sheet. Right? We've got the Revere product and

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:08.406Z)

How do do it? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:10.421Z)

we're we kind of have I mean, we're fortunate in some ways.

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:12.426Z)

Yeah. But it that's that's you bring up a good point.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:13.951Z)

That we have that road map. Right? Because we're not we're at

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:16.646Z)

Here, and that's one thing that I've been

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:18.231Z)

monetizing platforms and commercial real estate and saying, okay. There

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:18.356Z)

really kind of focusing on is when it comes to

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:22.241Z)

they're doing this. They're just not doing it for the hotel sector.

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:22.986Z)

AI and probably the number one differentiator

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:25.801Z)

So we can do this for the hotel sector. Right? But we

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:29.286Z)

from what we're doing versus the other

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:29.391Z)

can see where they're having success, where they're not having success, where they're

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:32.206Z)

tools in the space.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:33.311Z)

planning. So we're we're fortunate in many ways that

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:34.246Z)

Is that because we are an underwriting

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:36.601Z)

we're not doing something that has never been done before.

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:37.266Z)

tool, we have forward looking data. Everybody else is using historical data and extrapolating forward. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:40.331Z)

Just right. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:44.866Z)

So when we start talking to investors, that's one of the things that needs to be a core part of our pitch is that

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:52.911Z)

No one will do it for hotels. Right? Because

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:54.516Z)

this is something that other providers can't do.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:58:58.161Z)

because hotels is just a weird little property type.

### You (2025-07-28T14:58:58.776Z)

They don't have users who are forecasting cap rates and forecasting interest rates and everything else. Right? No. Right. Right. Yep. So our golden egg is taking data like what Drew has, historical data, taking the data that the STR report includes you know, not not STR data, but getting the same data from our users, combining it with

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:59:28.561Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T14:59:32.076Z)

what they're inputting for their forecast, and, you know, that is that is where the the the money is gonna be coming from. So

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:59:43.631Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T14:59:48.116Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:59:50.881Z)

That is true. Right? Even deal path doesn't have that because they don't have an they don't have the AVMs built into the pipeline management.

### You (2025-07-28T14:59:54.596Z)

Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T14:59:58.991Z)

Yet.

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:07.126Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and and don't get me wrong. I'm not concerned about any hurt feelings or anything from the weekend. I don't think anybody took it that way. I know I didn't. So I think I think

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:30.441Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:30.526Z)

everything's fine.

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:31.921Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:33.196Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:33.541Z)

Alright. Good. What else? Is there anything else where we

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:33.876Z)

yeah. Now that you made that comment about him being documentation oriented and if I

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:37.791Z)

talk at 05:30, and we'll go through all of this with everyone? And,

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:40.406Z)

make it clear that, you know, I'm not trying to be

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:42.131Z)

yeah, it's good. It's good. I'm so happy we have a product manager. You make

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:45.806Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:46.351Z)

such a big difference, and I'm very happy we have Drew too because

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:46.696Z)

the gatekeeper. And saying yes or no. It's not I it's not like I have the final

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:49.401Z)

right, if it were up to Mark and I, you would probably be like,

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:52.276Z)

decision, but if they understand the process,

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:54.371Z)

holy shit. These two are

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:56.336Z)

and, you know, if Drew then sees, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:00:58.671Z)

like, they're not very good at putting it out on paper.

### You (2025-07-28T15:00:59.076Z)

why I have to be in there, for documentation and, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:02.831Z)

What it is they want. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T15:01:03.926Z)

that also is the basis of training manuals. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:15.751Z)

Mm-mm.

### You (2025-07-28T15:01:16.036Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I have noticed he sends out some pretty good notes after

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:32.011Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T15:01:32.666Z)

some calls. We've there's been a few calls where he sends out, and it's like, wow. He's he's a good notetaker. So I get it. I

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:36.951Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-28T15:01:39.816Z)

yeah, I I understand why now. So alright.

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:45.451Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T15:01:45.726Z)

Yep. Yep. We'll see you then. Alright. Thanks.

### Guest (2025-07-28T15:01:53.681Z)

He feels super strongly about that. He he feels like if he doesn't get something on paper, he and his chief technology officer walk away with very different interpretations of how a conversation concluded. And so that's why he's always like, okay. I he feels the obligation. To take what the business, the hotel people are talking about and get it on paper because he doesn't want a repeat of what's happened in his own business. Yes. He's a good notetaker. Yep. So alright. Very good. Thank you for this, Howard. And we will chat at 05:30 today. Okay. Bye.
