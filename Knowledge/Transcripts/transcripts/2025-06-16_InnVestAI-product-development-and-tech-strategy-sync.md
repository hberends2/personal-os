Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:02.709Z)

Just a couple more items on the expense.

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:07.509Z)

Investment. Insurance and taxes, I think, I need to add. And then I can move on to capital expense and some of the other items that are in the parking lot. And Should be ready to go. Should be ready to go pretty soon, maybe by the end of the week. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:25.472Z)

That's

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:25.519Z)

well Yeah. That's good to hear. So what I was working on

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:28.452Z)

good to hear. So what I was working on is to embed that entire

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:30.549Z)

is to embed that entire thing in the application itself.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:33.422Z)

in the application itself rather than linking outside. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:34.059Z)

Rather than clicking outside. Right? Okay. I think people just embed it

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:37.732Z)

I think, you know, if we could just embed it

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:39.079Z)

inside.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:40.032Z)

inside itself.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:40.189Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Then that would

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:41.412Z)

Then that would be great.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:43.019Z)

be great. Yeah. And I also

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:45.032Z)

And then I'm also kind of trying to

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:45.649Z)

kind of try. To

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:47.882Z)

everything online. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:49.959Z)

Yeah. Trying to migrate the data and things on super ways and then, you know, and I get that

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:52.082Z)

Trying to migrate the database on super base and then, you know, get that connected

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:55.379Z)

connected to the application. Yeah. Well, they are we can send and then deploy it.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:07:56.782Z)

application, build the application, and then deploy it.

### You (2025-06-16T15:07:59.429Z)

So, yeah, I'm doing that. Cool.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:00.442Z)

Yeah. I'm doing that.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:02.929Z)

Cool. Have a nice day. Everything else going? How

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:03.412Z)

I can't progress that. Yeah. Yeah. Everything is everything is alright.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:07.179Z)

Everything alright? Yeah. Everything is everything is alright. Everything is alright. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:12.012Z)

Everything is alright. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:15.259Z)

Yeah. I I don't have a whole lot. I I did send out an email

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:16.342Z)

Of course.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:20.229Z)

with a link for everybody to take look at it. And I'm waiting to hear back. Just a couple questions I have on kind of more or less the order of things.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:30.872Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:31.079Z)

Yeah. And then also, had a question more specific for Mark. But other than that, I'm just gonna keep plugging away. And

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:40.902Z)

Well,

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:41.379Z)

I mean, I I I think at first, was getting hung up on making things really good.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:48.142Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:48.349Z)

And nice and perfect and and, like,

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:08:50.972Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:08:51.639Z)

now I'm getting to the point. It's like, okay. Let's just make sure there's a spot for this stuff and people can you know, I'm I I think I need to worry more about navigation and does it make sense before we start worrying about calculating and formatting, getting columns to line up, and everything else. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:10.992Z)

Yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. And

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:11.259Z)

Yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. And I guess, if I'm able to get better, so what I would

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:14.012Z)

yeah, I mean, if I'm able to embed it, so whatever changes

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:15.809Z)

change is you may it will just be part of the application. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:17.482Z)

you make, it'll just be part of the application. If not, then we'll just have the and then, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:22.119Z)

Okay. Course. Take updated version of it then.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:23.232Z)

of course, the updated version will be there.

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:24.739Z)

Yeah. Embedding would be really cool. Hopefully, we can get that. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:29.052Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:29.349Z)

alright. Anything I can

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:33.032Z)

We are admitted. No. All good. All good. So I think we do have oh, you had a meeting on

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:39.359Z)

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:39.682Z)

Wednesday with some not Wednesday, Friday with somebody. Right?

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:42.329Z)

From CB, I think.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:43.512Z)

From CBRE?

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:44.339Z)

It won't be that. Yeah. No. Not not

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:45.442Z)

He told me last week.

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:49.189Z)

CVRE. It was the

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:50.572Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:52.059Z)

the guy that Nancy Reddy Oh, yeah. The guy.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:57.032Z)

Yeah. The guy that

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:58.099Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:09:58.862Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:09:58.969Z)

So, yeah, I I I mean, he was a it was it was a good conversation.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:03.092Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-06-16T15:10:06.479Z)

But the question is, you know, I don't know. You know? What would we use them for? And he did say that he would be interested in meeting with Mark and Diane Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:15.432Z)

Good day.

### You (2025-06-16T15:10:19.459Z)

He didn't know who they were, but it sounds like they may have had a you know, I think there may have been a a possibility that Mark may have met with him or or might know him, but

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:33.492Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:10:37.299Z)

anyway, he has Diane and Mark both have deep connections to CBRE.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:46.302Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-16T15:10:47.449Z)

This guy has deep connections with Walker and Dunlop and Newmark.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:52.632Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T15:10:52.989Z)

And both of those are extensive users of Berends IQ. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:10:58.472Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:11:00.139Z)

as well as CBRE. So all three of them then would be great people to to connect with to start, you know, getting some input and feedback. So he said he'd be more than happy to make some introductions. And so you know, that's kinda where we left it. Yeah, I mean, he's he's been he reminds me a lot about

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:11:21.052Z)

So what Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:11:24.209Z)

of Mark because he was pretty much in charge of the con commercial. Now he didn't do so he he he doesn't have a hotel background. But the groups he worked with did. And he had some

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:11:39.082Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-16T15:11:42.509Z)

groups that had hotels that reported up to him

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:11:45.512Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-16T15:11:46.709Z)

he didn't do any hands on.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:11:48.712Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T15:11:49.059Z)

But Okay. You know, he's he has a very similar background to Mark leading these groups at a big brokerage house and breaking off on his own, doing consulting, doing some of his own investing. And another interesting thing is, you know, Mark is focused on development and investing in hotels. And this guy is very involved

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:12:12.732Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:12:15.009Z)

with construction consulting. And so there's another area that could potentially benefit us in the long run. You know, because we we had people at Red IQ for years asking us to build a model that they can use for building an apartment community.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:12:38.772Z)

That

### You (2025-06-16T15:12:39.199Z)

Which is way more involved because then you have to start talking about, you know, here's my land acquisition and here's my architecture cost and here's my permitting. I mean there's a lot more items you have to include so I'm wondering if maybe there's a

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:12:55.452Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-16T15:12:57.349Z)

potential to do the same thing with hotel. But that would have to be couple years down the road. We gotta

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:04.022Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:05.769Z)

build out the core product first, and then we can start looking at that. Oh, another thing I was gonna I just wanna plant the seed of the of an idea that we should be designing authentication with SSO in mind. Yeah. Everything. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:22.442Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We we have to yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:23.719Z)

And I don't know what caused that to jump in my mind over the weekend, but

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:24.502Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:27.909Z)

you know, I was thinking about you know, the fact that it seemed to be difficult at Red IQ But, you know, if we can if we can include that right from step one, I think we could probably be able to offer that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:42.902Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:43.779Z)

Pretty quickly. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:44.592Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:45.059Z)

For for the POC version, we have pretty simple one.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:46.282Z)

For now, for the POC version, right, we have pretty simple

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:48.739Z)

We can just store it in a password in a table and then fetching it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:49.602Z)

one. We are just storing username, password in our table and then fetching it.

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:52.699Z)

But when we make the production level application, we will work on the actual

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:53.882Z)

When we make the production level application, when we work on the actual

### You (2025-06-16T15:13:56.999Z)

code base that should have the SSO for sure. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:13:58.132Z)

code base, that should have the SSO for sure.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:00.359Z)

Yeah. I'm assuming that you you know when we start working with the Hiltons and the Courts and the Marriotts and the huge corporations, that's something they're gonna probably insist on. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:13.922Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. We'll

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:15.909Z)

A good time.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:17.032Z)

we can

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:17.149Z)

Kind of create the security rules.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:18.292Z)

kind of create a security road map. Like, you know, this is

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:21.559Z)

Probably gonna add there too.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:22.512Z)

what we gonna add there too.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:23.349Z)

Yeah. So can we

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:24.532Z)

SSO can be one part and then other compliances.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:24.599Z)

one part and then other compliances.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:28.892Z)

Be that data governance on.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:30.229Z)

Yeah. The cloud security.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:32.432Z)

Are the security

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:34.369Z)

The

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:35.752Z)

all that.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:37.349Z)

Well, that's that's not anything that I have experience in, so I'm gonna have to know, just let me know if there's anything I can help you know, research wise, but that's maybe on my

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:47.932Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:49.219Z)

pay grade. So Yep. Yep. Definitely. I'm with the I'll I'll take care of that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:14:52.602Z)

Yep. Yeah. Definitely. I would I'll I'll take care of that. The thing I was about to ask about that person, so what is he

### You (2025-06-16T15:14:58.119Z)

Person. So what is he interested in? The state or is interested in

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:15:00.752Z)

he interested in Angel investing, or he's interested in

### You (2025-06-16T15:15:03.409Z)

I didn't bring it up.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:15:05.022Z)

no. Okay.

### You (2025-06-16T15:15:05.829Z)

It was just an introductory call. I didn't want him to think that I was just interested in this check book. And that But I think that's something that

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:15:12.442Z)

And that

### You (2025-06-16T15:15:14.359Z)

you know, definitely Mark and Diane can discuss with him if there's an opportunity there. And and so, yeah, Possibly. I mean, he seems to be very well connected and, you know, he might be able to help with putting together a group of investors or something. But yeah, that's that's something I want Diane to lead that conversation. So Sounds good. Sounds good. So, one thing I wanna

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:15:42.792Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good. So one thing I wonder

### You (2025-06-16T15:15:46.219Z)

think now.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:15:46.712Z)

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:16:04.542Z)

### You (2025-06-16T15:16:06.339Z)

go well. So let's see. Good. Good. Yeah. I know I know of Morgan Properties. I knew somebody who used to work there. I'd have to double check to see if

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:16:17.009Z)

I have been on phone calls with them at many different times. So I am familiar with them. I'm familiar with the the company itself and, you know, it would I would love to get a foot in the door with them. Probably wouldn't benefit InnVestAI, but who says that's the only thing we have to work on?

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:03.392Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:03.619Z)

mind frame.

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:36.999Z)

Is

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:39.702Z)

work. Right? It's like eight hours of data work. Is what we need at InnVestAI too. Right? I I'm

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:46.449Z)

pretty good at all.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:47.842Z)

good with all the things. Data, I'm not done, like, eight hours.

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:49.509Z)

I've done, like, eight hours.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:52.512Z)

Data and AI. So

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:52.709Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:54.722Z)

I'm getting exposed to that, which is amazing.

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:54.849Z)

exposed to that? System? Okay. Kind of

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:58.152Z)

It's kind of

### You (2025-06-16T15:18:58.979Z)

Yeah. I'm gonna have to double check too. I I think

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:18:59.242Z)

helped me a lot.

### You (2025-06-16T15:19:03.319Z)

I know Morgan is big in multifamily. But they may have other asset types besides apartments. I don't know. Have you have you looked into that to see what other I don't think they have, loss protective

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:19:16.902Z)

Don't think they have hospitality or anything.

### You (2025-06-16T15:19:17.939Z)

I don't think hospitality. I'm just wondering if they have other you know, student housing, self storage,

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:19:26.142Z)

Okay. No. I'm not sure about that. But, yeah, I'll come to know once I join them for sure.

### You (2025-06-16T15:19:33.299Z)

Because I still think that there's a good opportunity in a RedIQ type model for self storage You know? I was always

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:19:42.012Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-16T15:19:43.179Z)

pushing to have that on the road map, and we actually did have it on the road map at Red Eye We were hoping to do it later this year, next year, before the before Radix bought it. Then Blair made it clear he didn't wanna do anything but apartment communities. So, I mean, that's always something we could always look at as well. It's

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:01.462Z)

Yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:02.609Z)

it's a Yeah. Very simple business. So But, yeah, it's definitely a lot more content

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:09.522Z)

Yeah. I mean, definitely, there's a lot of opportunity. The only part is we are lagging on funding if we are little more we could I was thinking of getting some onshore

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:18.039Z)

getting some onshore like, not to get it

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:21.842Z)

like,

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:22.439Z)

But I could

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:22.482Z)

not very experienced, but I could kind of do the groundwork and then

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:24.039Z)

kind of do the current work and then you know, hand it over. To them.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:27.122Z)

you know,

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:27.459Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:27.602Z)

hand it over to them and

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:27.889Z)

let them work on.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:29.322Z)

let them work on that. I, you know,

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:29.609Z)

That. And I you know, probably I need few people call it guys.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:33.492Z)

probably, I knew college guys, who are really good. One of them is

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:35.249Z)

What we record. One of them is have a that have

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:38.932Z)

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:44.882Z)

And he was

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:46.689Z)

stupid when in the and all that

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:47.902Z)

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:50.979Z)

work. So

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:52.402Z)

Work. So

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:54.349Z)

whatever we have, which is finding out,

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:54.732Z)

I mean, if whenever we have that is funding out really,

### You (2025-06-16T15:20:57.059Z)

like, to use these guys. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:20:58.582Z)

like, to use these guys kind of accelerate the work. Right? Because if we just have

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:05.009Z)

What people

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:05.942Z)

one people, we'll just kind of get stuck

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:06.869Z)

and get stuck. I don't know. On the street part, particularly.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:10.632Z)

speed part particularly.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:11.219Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So if we could have some junior folks helping her out.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:13.262Z)

So if we could have some junior folks helping out,

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:15.639Z)

Then that'll be great. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:17.362Z)

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:18.519Z)

No. Absolutely.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:19.512Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:19.789Z)

Okay. Alright. No. I think that sounds good. I would imagine that if you do land the position at Morgan, then that would probably eliminate any of your visa sponsorship issues. Yeah. So we can have a

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:38.822Z)

Yeah. So Vijay will

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:39.989Z)

probably think that I'll do contact for now. They're around the. That's Oh, okay.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:41.342Z)

they're gonna do contract for now. They want to do a visa. That's a problem with everyone.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:44.929Z)

On all Yeah. But that is the payment part. They'll be able to go

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:46.752Z)

Yeah. But at least the payment part, they'll be able to do

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:49.249Z)

Yeah. Two weeks.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:51.062Z)

every two weeks.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:52.379Z)

So then we'll have

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:52.912Z)

So then we'll have I will not have that.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:53.319Z)

I'll have that delay and all that.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:21:55.982Z)

And all that.

### You (2025-06-16T15:21:56.079Z)

Yeah. I didn't I I guess I just assumed it was a full time position, but I didn't even think about the

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:22:00.462Z)

Yeah. I think

### You (2025-06-16T15:22:00.969Z)

it could be a contract. But Okay. Still

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:22:04.892Z)

very hard hard to get a full time on H and B right now.

### You (2025-06-16T15:22:07.029Z)

Yeah. Yeah. But I think they would probably be way more dependable to to to pay you than apparently this group that you're with right now is. So Right.

### Guest (2025-06-16T15:22:16.912Z)

Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-16T15:22:18.139Z)
