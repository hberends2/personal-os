### You (2025-09-25T21:31:47.776Z)

Hey, Mark, how are you?

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:31:48.186Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-09-25T21:31:50.576Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:31:52.586Z)

Good. How are you?

### You (2025-09-25T21:31:52.816Z)

So far, it looks like it's just two of us.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:31:59.626Z)

I'm in the car.

### You (2025-09-25T21:32:01.536Z)

Well, there were emails going around from Diane and Drew, so I'm gonna. Oh, there he is. Drew's on now. Hey, Drew. Hey there. Hey. Diane.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:32:13.306Z)

Hey. All right. I don't know if we have a whole lot. To catch up on. I don't know if there's been a whole lot of change in the last two days. What am I scheduling? Now. I think. I mean, Diane, I know you said you're gonna work on the LLC this weekend. Did you send the safe note to Carlos? I did. Yep, on Tuesday night. And then I followed up tonight to see if they had any questions. But I was like, you know, like I was. While we. Totally understandable. While we worked through the safe note. I was behind about a week giving it to them, so I want to make sure they have enough time to review it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay? Budget. I think, you know, I don't think any of these change. I know the node. You still need to review the budget, right? For the kind of balance 20, 26. Yeah, yeah. Please, give me some more time. Yeah, okay. On the pitch deck. I have mark bay. We reviewed that yesterday. I have not done anything to it since. But I'm going to probably today or early tomorrow. We have Diane working on the one pager. I. Carrie on the one pager, right. I responded to some of her questions today. Yeah, I saw that, and I followed up just a few minutes ago as well. Then Carrie needs everyone's comments on. The logo as well. And I know Howard sent his. I have some to send. But she wanted it by. She's very organized. She wanted it by, like, 10pm Pacific tomorrow. Yeah. So okay. I think that's as far as operations and finance and marketing collateral. I mean, I. And I recorded a video. Vinod Howard. I sent it to you guys. So it's like 15 minutes long, but I go through what I did. On the application on the website. Testing things out. Gave you feedback. I'm sure you probably. I'm guessing you have not had a chance to watch it yet. But once you do, let me know if you have questions. And. That'll give you guys some, you know, something we can work on. And review again next week. Howard. Just one thing on my side. This probably remark anyone else is because I have a growing friendship with Chelsea. Who's a young VP over at their vc. I asked her if she could give us an introduction to the bridge team because they may be invested in bridge. She talks about them all the time. And she said yes. Can you send some material over so that I can share with them? So I'm gonna. I'm just waiting until we get Mark's material ready or the one pager to send over, but Mark maybe another reach out to them to see if they're gonna be at Phoenix. I. Just wanted to mention that because. Which is their bridge group. The bridge group is that they're the lender. That is coordinating with Berends on select service debt placement. Digitally. That's part of Thayer. I think there's invested in it. Personally. I'm an investor in there. Fun. So they should. I mean, more than me. They should give you an introduction, so the appropriate time. I mean, I could just walk it over to the right people at Thayer. But I just know what they need. You know, I think we're really, really early for them. Okay? Typically they'd like to see, you know, some business. Oh, no, not there, Mark. I'm talking about, like, if there's a strategic relationship that could be formed with Bridge. Right? Because Bridge is placing loans, and so if we could partner with them, we'd have the underwriting solution. So it's more like trying to see if we can get in front of the bridge, guys, to see if. Just a talk, right? Maybe there's nothing, but maybe there is a strategic Send me a link to the bridge guy. Like which Would you send me a link to what the entity is so just so I can. I will. Yep. Thank you. Is it called? Bridge. It's just called Bridge. What is the full name, do you know? I've got to go back. I don't remember the full name. It's Bridge. But what I do know is. Well, I don't know this for sure, but Chelsea said they have developed a very good working. Relationship with the franchise development team s at, like, Marriott and Hilton. Which makes a lot of sense, right? From a debt placement perspective, but I'll send it all to you. And again, it's not. I'm just thinking strategic relationship. How do we partner with people to get our platform out there? More. More than the fair piece of it? Because I know that's down the road for us. Okay, sounds good. Okay, thank you. I just resent the email for a few weeks ago. There was a thread with the three of us talking about it. But I just resent it. It's got the link to bridge in there. In the context, it's like. Thanks. And I have one other thing. I'm sorry, this is totally off topic, but I just want to ask it Drew or Mark, do you know Muhari Hospital ity? Yeah, they're from. Based in london. I'm having coffee with a woman that works there tomorrow morning. Just a friend. Joe Hill introduced us. And I just was trying to understand if we had any connections or anything like that. We're a customer of mine. What? Their customer of mine. Mohari hospitality. Yeah. With the luxury that's global. Yeah. It's john rucci. And Brett something. Are the two asset managers. Right before? I think so. Yeah. Okay. All right, well, that's good to know. Yeah. I only deal with the two asset managers, john and bernado. We brett busher, but we handle their one hotel toronto with a four seasons madrid. The on dos costa rica. The four seasons costa rica. The ritz costa rica. And I think that's it. Got it. Apparently they have some sort of asset management emergency situation going on. And so it just. I'm meeting with her to just try to brainstorm some ideas. But it did spark in me later today as I was thinking through it, like, maybe this is another. Maybe this is another driftwood kind of thing, right? Where if we could help them, they could help us, but I have no idea. How the conversation is going to go tomorrow. I don't know what she needs, but I wanted to go in there. I can. This is somebody. Who are you meeting with? Her name is? She was introduced to me by Joe Hill, who's at Aries. He is the portfolio manager for their value Fund. Name is Linda Nell. She's here in Atlanta, Obviously, or else we wouldn't be paying in person in Milton. She's more hurry. Well, her email address is Mohari. Yes, I think her LinkedIn looks more like a consultant. Well, I wonder what linda nel this one. Yep, that's her. Mean, it's nothing. It's nothing urgent. I just wanted to check between the three of us, because every conversation is important right now, so. Yeah, and I'm glad I did, Drew. So I know that they're your customer. Yeah. You might change. My mark and I have been saying, everybody coordinate, so we're all on the same page. Because they are a customer. And I don't hear from them much. But I think that's because they have what they need. But they don't do very much like they don't like. They barely scratch the surface with what they could be doing. If there is. And when I say that, I mean it. They just have two or three reports they run. And then especially with these compact properties, it could be doing. Right. And that's all good, right? But I zeroed in on a very affluent founder, and I was thinking to myself, oh, gosh, good affluent founder. You know, maybe exchange some services for a safe note if we can help them out. I mean, and I was just thinking, between Drew and Mark and I, if they need some assistance. The three of us have some pretty good skill sets. Plus. Perhaps a sub to Chris Ostapovich or someone like that. But anyway, I don't know what she's gonna tell me what their emergency is, but tomorrow at 9:30. All right, well, y'all be interested. To hear gencom is also partner of theirs and is also a customer. Okay. That's complicated. Well, just gencom is a comp. Well, I'm sure has lots of opinions about this, but gencom is a complicated partner for anyone to have. Right. And so reputationally and just from a control perspective and things like that. But that's good to know. Thank you. I don't know what the right word is. Yeah, controlled. Controlling. I can see that, yes. And drovecta. I'm sorry, I didn't catch this. You have a currency converter then, right? Because these hotels are international. Yes. Yeah, everything. We have five or six different currencies. Pounds. So we obviously. Whatever currencies you want to see. All right. Thank you. I just wanted to mention it. Just to kind of be on the same page as everyone else. Yeah, I think. I mean, maybe don't mention the investment or safe yet. I'm just gonna listen to what she has to say, what their needs are, right? Yeah, okay. Cool. Well, Howard, did you guys want. Yesterday, two days ago. So the note had to drop to. You guys want to cover anything? Or mention anything. No, I just wanted to give. You guys have any feedback for me? I'm actually traveling. I came to New Jersey. For some family. I think body. I'm still here. Okay? Yeah. I just sent you a recorded video in teams. Vinod, what did you think of the logo? That. I mean, I think we're getting in a closer direction. I'm just curious what your thoughts are about what Carrie produced from a logo perspective. In the last meeting.

### You (2025-09-25T21:45:01.936Z)

Yeah, yesterday.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:45:03.466Z)

Today, yesterday. Yesterday. I don't think I looked at that email. Was it on the email?

### You (2025-09-25T21:45:10.576Z)

It was an email, and it had a link to Canva. She's working in Canva. So it would have taken you to the logos there. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:45:23.626Z)

And who sent the email, Carrie? Yeah, I don't think I have her email. I don't have email. I'll forward it to you. It's important to get your opinion on it because you see more technology logos than I do. And Howard had some really good feedback for her on it. And Drew and Mark are probably saying, why in God's name is Diane so focused on the logo? It's just there was one time in my career where I had a company we started, and I didn't love the logo. And you kind of get stuck with it. Right. And so we're this for. A if we trademark it for potentially a long time. And that's why I'm bit focused on the logo. More than we're good. So I'm good. Subject to Howard two comments. Okay? No. Can you look at it? I don't have the email yet, so I'm just looking in my outlook. I don't have the email. I just responded on the thread. Like five minutes ago. 10, 15 minutes ago. Am I in that thread? Yeah, you are.

### You (2025-09-25T21:46:41.136Z)

What is the subject?

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:46:41.146Z)

Okay? I don't know what's going on.

### You (2025-09-25T21:46:45.296Z)

Okay. Yeah, that's right.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:46:48.186Z)

Just InnVestAI. Discuss the logo right now. If you want. I don't have the entire thread.

### You (2025-09-25T21:47:04.336Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is InnVestAI email.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:47:05.626Z)

Is that the right email? Showing? I think so. And scroll down. There's a link to it, right? Yeah, I see that. But some reason I don't have it. That's it. Oh, no, that's not it.

### You (2025-09-25T21:47:27.056Z)

Yeah. But if you scroll down, there's the new one.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:47:28.506Z)

That's the old one, right?

### You (2025-09-25T21:47:32.256Z)

3b.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:47:34.026Z)

Oh, okay. Okay, so which. Which one do you guys like so far? This one. So we're kind of working with this one and just saying, what change it in. Howard had some. What changes do we want to make? And add some good inputs about, like, the windows. Why the color and the arrow. You can't really see the point of. And my only thing is. Hey, Drew, I know you're controlling, right? You're controlling the screen right now. Can you just for just bear with me and humor me? Say hi. Their website. The eli e l I s e a I dot com. Which I realize, I know that they started as a chat box and all of that, but do you see up in the corner to the left hand side is their logo? It's right above your cursor. Yep. Okay, so do you see how the text is closer together and the AI on the logo is smaller and up in the corner? Like I feel like that feels very. And I don't want to exactly copy it, but the letters are kind of far stays apart. And if we pull together a little bit and put the AI up above in the. In the logo. And then maybe we make the building a tiny bit smaller just to fit with the lightness and feel of the logo. You're going to compare them, Drew. Side by side. Look at you. See how much we have so much space in between all the letters and be, S, T, A, I. And theirs is really very much. Close together. Their letters. And then the AI piece is more of, like, up in the corner, just AI. Because, Howard, you've said this before, right? Like a we secure the domain for. AI.com as well. And that might be the way the industry is going. Do I have that right?

### You (2025-09-25T21:49:55.616Z)

We have both InnVestAI And InnVestAI.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:49:58.746Z)

From.

### You (2025-09-25T21:50:03.376Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:50:06.986Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-25T21:50:07.056Z)

I see what you're saying about the font being more compressed. I like that as well. If we wanted to just choose a different font, I'm not excited about making the AI smaller. But, you know, we. Well, I mean, we could lift it up maybe halfway, right?

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:50:26.586Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-25T21:50:27.696Z)

When I look at elise AI, all I see is elise. You know, the AI Is really kind of in the background. But, you know, that's just my opinion. If anybody else likes it, and I do agree. I think maybe we could just make the building a little bit smaller.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:50:40.266Z)

That's. That's good.

### You (2025-09-25T21:50:47.536Z)

Because as I look. As I look at it,

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:50:49.546Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T21:50:50.736Z)

Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:50:52.186Z)

So. Yeah, I don't like the fact that. I don't like the fact that building is like an invest is now very thicker. So if we could do something with that building, I don't know how either. Probably not use the background color and rather use a lining on that. Lining like a lise AI has, like. Yeah, probably not. Fill that box, that green box, with color.

### You (2025-09-25T21:51:35.376Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:51:37.626Z)

Probably something on that sort. Of building is building. And that thing is very dominating. And our name is, like, got very thinner now. So if we could make that inner somehow. That kind of balance it out. The building. Yeah. I was going to say. I would imagine that our way on that part.

### You (2025-09-25T21:52:10.496Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:52:13.546Z)

Can you guys hear me? Yes, the way I use my logo. And my company name. I don't always have the name there, so I wanted the logo to be like, something that could, to some extent, standalone. So let me go. To.

### You (2025-09-25T21:52:44.736Z)

Drew. I was kind of thinking the same thing as well when we first started looking at this, you know, because if you think.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:52:49.466Z)

Our pocket.

### You (2025-09-25T21:52:50.176Z)

Of OpenAI. I mean, you can go through all of these OpenAI, apple, google, they all have. A logo. Like Coke, Pepsi, all of them. You know what they are just by looking at the logo.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:53:25.660Z)

What we do Hospitality, you know, intel business intelligence. Right? So it's like very, very core and very strongly with what we They don't know what It was have to make your logo. I'll just use the right part and not the solution. Not the pineapple and Yeah. I mean, this to me is like again, Sometimes it's just a fart on the left. So maybe maybe we have I mean, they should be able to stand together and apart. Yeah. We can just have the name as logo as well just like LACI. Right? It is a name, but it also logo. So we don't need that. Logo on the left side. That is another option. We'll have to do some creative that You could put that. Cast. Yeah. I like the so one thing you can do is because you have a v, the mirror image of a v is an a. You could put the AI below as a mirror image of the v. Right? And then you could do something unique with the with the a and the I, but kind of like, that's what gives it placement is the is the mirror image of the v. Yeah. I mean, something like that. Because that logo has no more relation. I mean, it is really low tail, but it's still it is not very unique to InnVestAI. Yes.

### You (2025-09-25T21:55:28.165Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:55:28.550Z)

It it also doesn't really look like a hotel. It's just like a building. Not very hotel. Like, you know, how the old fashioned ring bells, or is that stupid? You you guys know what I'm talking about? Like, when you used to ring a bell at the front desk, and then put an arrow around it? And and again, please, that might be so stupid. We can also do, like, an we can also do, like, an old fashioned room key. Right? And and InnVestAI is the key to AI. Oh, that's interesting, Mark. Yeah. That is awesome. Oh, do. I remember it. Yes. Yeah. Only thing is we'll have to be really creative around that. Key. Come out, Now just put the key With the v. Right? With the the v in the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, let me take the stab at sending all our comments Carrie tomorrow morning. I think I got it, like, Drew, you're thinking put the AI underneath. I I hope we're all okay with the idea of, like, pulling the letters together a little bit more. Playing around with some other logos that might be a key might be a ring bell like an old hotel. Maybe one that doesn't have anything. Right? Yeah. I just mentioned that. Alright. Yeah. I think we could also do, like, I think we will will use them Right? Sometimes together, sometimes separate. Oh, that's not my ID. What's that doing there? Yeah. Sometimes it's just just the image Got it. Howard, can you run interference with Carrie Mae, say, like,

### You (2025-09-25T21:57:28.155Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:57:28.200Z)

what the hell? You guys are a pain in the ass. And just just tell her that we I mean, just tell her even tell her me personally that we're gonna be living with this for a decade. And so it's just we appreciate her taking the time. We're happy to pay her for

### You (2025-09-25T21:57:43.745Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:57:45.110Z)

taking the time to yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T21:57:47.865Z)

So

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:57:48.070Z)

Around with this some more.

### You (2025-09-25T21:57:49.565Z)

what are what what are the instructions to drop the building and just work on the just the word InnVestAI?

### Guest (2025-09-25T21:57:57.510Z)

I think it's to there's a couple of things to run some iterations. Make the building smaller and the arrow, like, more prominent, like you said. Oh, we do. So hold on. Because we are talking about spending money. Right? Okay. Are we gonna keep the building or do we wanna we're talking about running a few logos with different images, which would be a key and maybe an old fashioned ring bell. Or anything else anyone can come up with. Because because it doesn't I mean, I love the building. You're right. That could be any commercial property type. Right? And there's pros and cons to that that helps us if we ever decide to thing other than just hotels. But it doesn't particularly look like a hotel. Right? Right. We're we're also part of our tagline is that we're, you know, developed by hotel people for hotel people and that we wanna be hotel centric. Mhmm. I think having something that symbolizes hotels is probably a good thing. Yeah. I would yeah. I I I would say we if if if we're going to ask her to do more right now, then yeah, I'm I'm not sure what guidance I would give other than this is my opinion, obviously. But, like, other than we want some kind of image that is very, very indicative of what we do and and, you know, who our company or what our company is. I don't know what that would be. I like the key Something that ties into the investment life cycle, technology, real estate, hotels. Again, like, I don't know. I mean, you could spend she could create a thousand images and and none of them you know, like, don't wanna I want her to, like, endlessly work on Wait. Feedback on the font. Right? That font looks very plain. Like, like an aerial font or very, very plain font. Compare that font to the earliest font, look how just the font itself looks very creative. I mean, maybe honestly, would Elise say I know if we stole their font? No. I mean, we could use a different font. Similar different point. Mhmm. It needs to be closer. It's like the what Howard, how did you just say that the spacing needs

### You (2025-09-25T22:00:19.515Z)

Yeah. You can take a look at the font

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:00:20.620Z)

be closer together.

### You (2025-09-25T22:00:23.855Z)

that I suggested on there. On my laptop, they were kind of small. I didn't even bother blowing them up to see how it looked larger. But can I also say Diane, I agree 90% with what you say about you're stuck with the logo, but but companies change them all the time?

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:00:42.190Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:00:47.585Z)

If we can't if we yeah. Yeah. If if we if

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:00:49.270Z)

Yeah. I I agree.

### You (2025-09-25T22:00:51.445Z)

we're not on board with the building, why don't we just start the InnVestAI logo? Let's pick a font that we like and then we can can continue to work on that. You know, if we did a if we did a total overhaul changing our name,

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:02.880Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:06.575Z)

that's one thing, but you know, changing fonts or adding a logo at some point in the future, I I just

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:13.160Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:14.105Z)

I don't personally, don't think that's gonna be too big of a deal.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:16.920Z)

Okay. Got it. It's just coming from my personal experience. I had to live with Ultima. For a very long time, and I hate it. I despised it.

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:22.395Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:25.000Z)

So I'm just, like, very curious. Right? Do you trademark the name or you trademark the design of the logo? I think it's you trademark everything, don't you? You trade

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:35.135Z)

You can do both. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:37.860Z)

Yeah. Both.

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:38.485Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:39.200Z)

Different levels of trademarking. Yeah. Could we ask her to do one iteration with a key with the letters compressed just to see what it looks like?

### You (2025-09-25T22:01:49.065Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:01:50.850Z)

Won't cost a lot of money. Right? Well, we're but I mean, what I think we need more she can just create an image of a key and put it on paper, that's not useful. I mean, if if she's going to do more work, I love that she has been invested in learning about what we do. What the company is, what the product is, that awesome because I think I would ask her to think organically about what is an image that if somebody looks at it, they're like, oh, yeah. That's hotel technology platform. But, Drew, she won't know that. Right? That that would knows that. There the Right. So it's obviously but I'm saying that, like, we can give her the example of a key and other things, but I just I feel like it it saying to do a logo with a key isn't that helpful. Like, it's not I just I am, like and and that sounds kinda funny, but, like, she's gonna spend, you know, $30.60 bucks, like, might as well make it make it worth it. And, Howard, I think we did some research around the color Right? That's how we are raised to that green and the other color we are using. Right.

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:00.485Z)

Yeah. Blue blue and green were suggested.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:02.100Z)

True. True. True. True. True. Drew, do wanna send her an example of, like, an old fashioned hotel key with, like, the plastic thing? Or just Yeah. Give her a sense of what we're talking about. Maybe that would help. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:13.955Z)

So

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:14.670Z)

And and the deck that the deck that the The color the blue colors that you have that you didn't go pop or whatever the AI Well, I'm just saying the documents, stuff that we put together for the in Word with the pitch deck. Explains what we do.

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:31.505Z)

So

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:33.330Z)

Right? I want

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:34.015Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:34.470Z)

to the extent possible that an image should again, it should like,

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:39.285Z)

Let me just throw something against the wall.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:39.300Z)

make somebody think about what we

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:44.315Z)

I like the I like the key. I don't know if you plan on putting the InnVestAI within the key. If you plan on putting the key elsewhere. But when I think of a hotel, the first thing that comes to mind is a bed. And so what if we

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:03:56.940Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-09-25T22:03:59.565Z)

kind of had a bed shape where the AI is in a rectangular

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:00.900Z)

Hi.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:04.235Z)

pillow, and the invest would be like

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:05.600Z)

Hi.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:07.335Z)

the rest of the bed.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:11.780Z)

That's interesting. You'd have, a bed, like, the bed, and then in vet day, I am

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:16.625Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:18.870Z)

of it.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:19.645Z)

Yeah. So like the AI would be on the pillow, the InnVest would be on the bed. So it would be horizontally on there. But, I mean, that would just be basically a wreck

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:30.260Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:32.795Z)

with a little line through it. I I don't know. I'm just

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:36.750Z)

That's interesting. That's it. That's that especially as a non

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:36.875Z)

trying to come up with something.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:41.480Z)

person that you think of the bed first.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:44.105Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:44.840Z)

Yeah. Interesting for sure, but it has to makes like, it has to look exactly as you are explaining.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:52.495Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:52.620Z)

Small image. Like, even in very small image, it should look like a

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:56.015Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:56.370Z)

and bed.

### You (2025-09-25T22:04:56.805Z)

It would be.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:04:57.650Z)

Challenging. Hey. Go back to the idea. Hey, guys. I have to run to a dinner, but I I that this logo is in good hands. Thank you. It turns out to be.

### You (2025-09-25T22:05:10.245Z)

Yeah. Whoever whoever's hands it is. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:05:12.530Z)

Yeah. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks. So but but, Drew, can I come back to are you concerned that we're gonna spend too much money on this? Are you concerned that I just don't see why I can spend any money just don't see why we should spend any any money on it if it's not going to be I just again, like, You're the one footing the bill. So yes. Until we have an actual bank account. So I I mean and and then I perfectly like, I I spent months working on my logo. And I don't know. Why don't we just stick to the current logo right now? We don't hate it too much? And then probably probably come up with the plans. We handed over whom, you know, we have to pay on our leases or whatever. Okay. So let me just go back to this. Howard gave comments, and they were actually very good. Comments. They were like, the window size, the coloring, and the arrow keys. So let's let her just finish that. And send it to us, and we'll be done for now. And then we'll work on it more over time. Is that alright? Howard, how about we stick to the colors we had researched? Otherwise, we'll have to kind of change those colors everywhere. We I don't mind changing it, but just that we researched that those colors were the one we should use.

### You (2025-09-25T22:06:33.435Z)

The colors that are on right now.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:06:34.510Z)

Using. Yeah. Drew, you're gonna have to

### You (2025-09-25T22:06:35.805Z)

Yeah,

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:06:39.520Z)

find on that because, like, your PopAI thing with the with the is that green or blue? I'm color blind. I I honestly like, colors are not my thing. Because all of Drew's pitch deck stuff is all blue. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You wanna pop something like that up? Do do you mind? This is kind of that dark, yeah, dark blue, which and and it's orange. So I guess theoretically, we it should yes, it should match, like, the coloring scheme of our logo I mean, what we what we do meet eventually

### You (2025-09-25T22:07:27.175Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:07:29.460Z)

is a is a styling guide. Something that right. Like and I I I have one for with LBIS, but it's not and I'm even I'm still working on that five years later. I'm not super great at the aesthetics and colors, so it's hard to and and yeah. But, like, Yeah. I believe this this blue is close to what we have, the blue on our current logo. Right?

### You (2025-09-25T22:07:53.275Z)

Yeah. I think our current logo is a little bit more of a bold, bright blue along with a green Well, no. Actually actually, yeah, the the blue in this logo matches the blue pretty closely in what Carrie did. She just changed the green AI to to gold.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:08:19.290Z)

And that's what gold is what Drew has in his deck. Or orange. However you wanna say gold and orange.

### You (2025-09-25T22:08:25.905Z)

Okay. So so would we just want her to change the

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:08:28.150Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T22:08:29.825Z)

AI to the same shade of orange as in the deck? Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:08:34.270Z)

Mhmm. Yes.

### You (2025-09-25T22:08:37.545Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:08:38.750Z)

We wanna make this the rest of this blue, like, a blue color? This blue color. Or this blue color? I think we are going in the reverse direction. We should use colors logo Like, we should use the colors from the logo, not other way around.

### You (2025-09-25T22:09:02.965Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:09:03.940Z)

Logo should represent the colors. Yeah. That we all agree to, but we just don't have that right now. And it would be in everything.

### You (2025-09-25T22:09:11.955Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:09:12.780Z)

The logo, the wording, the deck, but we just yeah. We don't have a we don't have a silent guide. We don't have an agreed upon font. We don't have an agreed upon none of that I mean, maybe maybe that's something we should ask Jerry to do before she does anything else as

### You (2025-09-25T22:09:24.695Z)

Yeah. That's a good point now to to both

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:09:25.700Z)

come up with a Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:09:28.435Z)

to what Vinod mentioned earlier though, I mean, we did do some research on colors and how they affect people, what are the good colors for a financial oriented and it came up that blue and green with touches of gold It gives you a calm secure, I don't remember all the words that it mentioned, but

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:09:57.980Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-25T22:09:59.025Z)

if you take a look at a lot of the financial oriented products, they do include a lot of blues and greens. So maybe to Vinod's points. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:11.000Z)

I don't see orange. I I I mean, I like I I like good

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:13.455Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:14.350Z)

My main thing is I just would love it to be thinner and a little more condensed. So if it feels like like this is this is what I'm trying to express.

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:19.925Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:21.530Z)

That there's this lightness that comes out of the heaviness of all the work we have

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:24.895Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:25.990Z)

to do. Right? It's like a relief that That that that's what the I think when I talk about the font, I'm trying to get at. When I see the AlethAI font, I feel a sense of relief that it's modern, and and and so that's the main thing I'm

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:38.645Z)

Yeah. Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:41.580Z)

trying to get out of the logo.

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:43.295Z)

Yeah. I can I can summarize all that to to to Carrie? I don't think that's that's be a problem at all.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:51.250Z)

Okay. But she's not gonna spend tons of time because we're just gonna lock down an interim low

### You (2025-09-25T22:10:54.225Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:10:57.060Z)

I'm not gonna trademark it. Right? We're gonna put the trademarking on the on the back burner for now. And then once we get further

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:01.155Z)

We wanna wanna make sure we trademark the name. Yeah. Just just

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:11:03.980Z)

okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:06.775Z)

just forming an LLC is not as same as a trademark.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:11:07.170Z)

I'm gonna trademark the name. Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:09.945Z)

So somebody else could come in. So, that's why I'm saying maybe we just initially forget the building and just go with InnVestAI and copyright InnVestAI. Don't worry about the copywriting colors or logos, and then we can continue to work on the logo part. But

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:11:32.350Z)

Could she do one mock up?

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:32.685Z)

for this conference coming up in yeah. For this for the conference coming up in October, I just think InnVestAI is fine. Just put that up in the top left corner of the the handout, we can go from there. And use use this version here. Without without the bars.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:11:50.130Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:51.375Z)

But kind of that. But I also agree. I now now that I have seen the Elise

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:11:51.610Z)

Okay. Okay. Yep.

### You (2025-09-25T22:11:56.225Z)

AI font, I know what your it wasn't necessarily the font, but maybe if we make it lighter and more condensed.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:02.100Z)

Lighter. Right? It's like relief.

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:03.985Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:06.350Z)

Is what it tries to explain is like, oh, we're no longer in this

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:06.435Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:10.060Z)

heavy environment. Right? We're, like, free of of all this

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:12.565Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:15.180Z)

goddamn work that we all do.

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:15.765Z)

Alright. Yeah. I I I can go back to the

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:18.420Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:19.715Z)

the website, like, that that Drew has pulled up. I'll just snap a couple screenshots of their font and just describe to her more what what it is that we're looking for.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:30.910Z)

Okay. Thank you. I didn't

### You (2025-09-25T22:12:32.395Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:12:35.350Z)

Vinoba, you gonna say something? No. I I was done with the logo discussion. I just want discuss something. Yeah. I'm just curious, like, what are we expecting from the conference that Mark going to? Because I see a lot of excite or, you know, mention of that conference in almost every call. What are we expecting? Like, are we expecting any funding? Or expecting clients that will do demos for. And the beginning of conversations for some people who could write a 100 k checks for a safe note. Okay. That's what I that's what I deal. Like like, if Mark sits down with some of his friends and starts to talk about this, would they be willing to write, you know, a check to be be an early participant in this? So it doesn't mean we're gonna walk away with the entire funding need complete, and we're gonna be spending the rest of four q on the phone with people doing demos and talking about it and about the monetization opportunities. But this is the third biggest hotel conference in The US. NYU is in June, and in January is Alice. This conference is a lot more relaxed because it's in Phoenix and a lot of people golf, but it has a little bit less in attendance than the other conferences. It's a little it's much more casual. But we're hoping that Mark comes back with people that we can start demoing the product for beta clients. And also planting the seed that you know, you could be a a safe invest you know, an initial safe investor for I'll just call it a 100 k because we don't know what we're really looking at. Got it. Got it. Drew, do did I am I incorrect? In No. I think that's I mean, I I go to the same conferences just to look for customers. And if if that's hospitality is a very, very small industry. There's you know, a few 100 people that are the kind of primary focus for what we're doing. And then you get you know, beyond that, there's obviously, like, you know, a lot more people, but you know, those those few 100 people attend these four conferences every year. And those conferences have about 3,000 participants in total. Right? But it's just this very small network industry. That whole network effect that we keep talking about. So I just wanted to it's not like a 300 person conference. There is probably 3,000 people going or maybe a little bit less to Phoenix. But hopefully, Mark sits down with, like, his buddies or buddies of buddies. Yeah. Probably five People we wanna talk to. And Mark probably knows half of those people pretty well. He's gonna Yep. Have drinks as long as so. Yep. So, like, is he planning to demo it live or No. No. Just conversational. Got you. He's gonna have some screenshots though, probably. Right? We'd be Drew, we agreed on maybe having some screenshots for him to show. Or in an email follow-up think he's gonna show anything at the conference. I think he's gonna follow-up the next day or, you know, like, the day or two after the conference with a link to something that people can look over, which screenshots And then from there, we would set up time to talk about to talk with each of these individuals. Which could be either using our pitch deck and talking about it, or it could be or it could be a demo depending on where we are. But there would be a couple of weeks between between now and then. So if we wanted to do a demo, you know, to your point, you know, your question the other day about staging environment. We would, yeah, we would have ample time to set that up. Yes. I think we are expecting some update on the website as well. So is working on the content part? We all are. I just don't have any time until Saturday. So Saturday is LLC and website for me. Correct. Great. And and Drew and and Mark are doing it as well. I just want you to know that, like, my goal personally is to close the day on Saturday with the LLC comments out to everyone and

### You (2025-09-25T22:17:05.745Z)

Did you

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:17:07.090Z)

feedback on the website.

### You (2025-09-25T22:17:08.975Z)

you get the comments that I sent in?

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:17:09.600Z)

Yeah. We

### You (2025-09-25T22:17:10.935Z)

Couple days ago?

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:17:14.670Z)

yeah. I've I've been I got them. I looked them over. I haven't had a chance to really think about responding yet, I'll try to do that tomorrow.

### You (2025-09-25T22:17:16.135Z)

Alright. No, no, that's fine. I don't really need a response, just wanted to those are things I had to point out.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:17:21.520Z)

Yeah. Alright. Do you guys Howard, did you have any familiarity with the SOC two compliance process or cost or timing? Like, or either maybe even though did did you guys have, like, any visibility into this when you were redIQ? Oh, we had SOC two with the red x. I kinda worked on that. Some time. I don't really know from the cost perspective, though. I was just working on making it you know, the compliant. I was working on the compliant part, but not sure about the cost

### You (2025-09-25T22:18:04.115Z)

I can I can get some information on that? I sent some information quite a cup

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:18:05.310Z)

though.

### You (2025-09-25T22:18:09.085Z)

months ago, a couple months ago at least on a company called Dellv. That will basically do the compliance for you in just a couple weeks.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:18:19.550Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-09-25T22:18:20.965Z)

But I don't know what the and and it's automated basically. So it's you keep updating continuously. Probably worth it. But I also believe you have to have a little bit of time under your belt to see how many issues come up, how quickly they're resolved, things like that. It's not something that we're I don't think it's gonna be something that we can get

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:18:44.820Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T22:18:46.755Z)

even maybe within the first six months, but we can get some more information on that.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:18:50.970Z)

Yeah. We had a tool called Vanta. We

### You (2025-09-25T22:18:52.175Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:18:55.820Z)

t a. That's what we are using. Okay. Got it. And mean, I just I'm one of those people that I just I guess, I repeat SOC two compliance because I've heard it so many times in my career. But I feel like it's something that's needed to work with premier financial institutions. So it will be banks or it will be, you know, big time investment managers. Am I explaining that right, or is there a better way to explain what's I think it depends on think it depends on what you're doing. If you were in the chain of potentially being audited, Like, if you are part of the audit process, then I think being talked to I mean, actually, I'm not even sure. Yeah. No. That might have been the case. We might have been all But that is about hotel operators. Hotel operators are not talked to compliant. Yeah. But, like, Xenia is SOC two compliance. Yeah. Because they're publicly Right. But until we need to be SOC two compliance if we're like, I know you're not but if we wanna go deep enough with these companies, that's why we need to be SOC two compliant. Yes.

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:01.515Z)

Let's get some more information on that because

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:03.490Z)

Like Agreed.

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:05.305Z)

a lot of the SOC two compliance is related to PII,

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:09.280Z)

What's that?

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:10.205Z)

personally identifiable, PII is personally identifiable information.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:16.500Z)

Oh, oh, got it. We're not gonna touch any of that.

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:16.885Z)

Names names, addresses, social security numbers,

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:20.590Z)

Credit card. Got it. So yeah.

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:21.915Z)

yeah, things like that. But yeah, so the SOC two compliance may not even apply.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:23.860Z)

We're not touching any of that.

### You (2025-09-25T22:20:28.385Z)

But we can get some information. It is. It it yeah. Yeah. That's that's part of it.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:20:45.550Z)

DealPath has a huge thing on their web page about why they're two compliance and how they did that. I'll shoot it out when I can find some time over the next week. I mean, SOC two compliance isn't in our sixth road map.

### You (2025-09-25T22:21:06.925Z)

Yeah. That that's that's different than SOC two, though.

### Guest (2025-09-25T22:21:08.390Z)

Or how we're gonna handle that. And

### You (2025-09-25T22:21:10.935Z)

We do have a security with authentication, single sign on that
