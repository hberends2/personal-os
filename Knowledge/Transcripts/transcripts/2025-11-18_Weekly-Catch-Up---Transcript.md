# Transcript for: Weekly Catch Up

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:02:56.273Z)

Hey. Sorry I jumped away. And I'm so sorry. I'm so unprofessional. I'm at the courtyard. Coral Gables and the desk does not have a plug. And I'm only going to go into their office a little bit. How are you?

### You (2025-11-18T15:03:12.357Z)

Okay? All right. Sorry for multitasking here. My wife needs new tires and I've got. Like tighter. Tighter web screen chatting on the other, and then I got you down here.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:03:25.873Z)

It's okay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:03:27.397Z)

No. We're good.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:03:29.793Z)

It's a good time. We can do it another time. I just thought maybe it would be best to keep our time and then. Okay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:03:35.877Z)

This is fine. I got. Caught up. In tire shopping and totally forgot. So it's no big deal.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:03:45.713Z)

Tire shopping is not fun, especially when you're not making any income, right? And you're like, tires are expensive.

### You (2025-11-18T15:03:49.637Z)

Yeah. They. Are. Could you find some good deals? Though. It's not too bad. So I think we'll be all right.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:04:03.473Z)

Good.

### You (2025-11-18T15:04:04.597Z)

So how's the budget?

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:04:05.073Z)

Well, let me just start out. Let me start with some, like. I guess I think this is great news. I don't know. I mean, this could probably be construed as not great news, but just thinking of this from the point that Driftwood is, like, think of this. Customer, investor, advisor, the CIA, kind of like. Concept. Right. That Pranav, who is the. The next person I'm going to introduce our team to at the right moment, described how he sees our relationship. So yesterday, I sat in a room with 15 driftwood people.

### You (2025-11-18T15:04:05.877Z)

Going.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:04:42.513Z)

Going through budgets. We have another day of it still. So it was on the oper. I was on the operations side. The head of operations, the head of sales, the head of accounting, right. On corporate side, on the. On the ownership side, you had Carlos Jr. Carlos Senior, who's his dad. The gc who's a partner? The head of asset management. The head of the chief financial officer. Right. Just kind of going through 25 hotels and talking about totality of it. So what was the hotel budgeting? Was there anything that wanted people wanted changed? How is that going to get changed? But then we started to get into some crazy, interesting conversations, which sparked ideas on opportunities for us around how much, how much challenge they're having right now with a lot of their assets. Have gone into special servicing, not always because they're underperforming, but because the initial loan document set up the DCR test to be trailing on maybe, like, six months or something like that. And so what's happening is there's a lot of seasonality, and some of these hotels. Maybe they do really well in summer, some of them. Right. Maybe some of them do really well in March, April, May. Some do really well in October and November. But depending on when you close that loan, the six month test is based on the closing date, not necessarily a date that reflects how the hotel industry should think about seasonality relative to performance or under performance. And why that, why I'm bringing that up is their frustration around lenders and servicers putting them into cash traps was through the roof. Frustration. Right. Like high, high, high frustration.

### You (2025-11-18T15:06:45.317Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:06:47.473Z)

And they will say, and this is true, right? Well, you're never going to get a special servicer lender to agree to, like, not, you know, to waive what they're doing. Unless you try to use it as a point up front for InnVestAI to bring a solution to the table. Right. That doesn't exist in the industry right now, which is if we're using it for the underwriting, if we're using. And I'm just going to take the debt piece of it. For a moment. If we're helping lenders underwrite, we could have a great deal of visibility into the seasonality of that hotel and how it would impact the coverage ratios and the. And the tests and things like that. To avoid a situation that is just stupid. Right? We're not. Hospitality isn't like multifamily or office. There's no rents. So we could use AI to look at the data and say, ok, you're closing in April and I can see the seasonality in the cash flow and the way the revenue's going to come in. So you might want to upfront think about setting your tests in a different way. So I realize people would laugh at me and say, you're never going to get anything like that to happen. DIANE But I think the end of the hotel industry is small enough, and if you went to this right people, maybe you could actually have an impact. But it goes, it gets tied back into the idea that it can't just be. We can't just be pitching people servicing because, you know, providing data for servicing. There's a lot of groups out there that can do that. That's not unique to us, but it also. You have to go back to the beginning of the deal. The beginning of the deal orientation is this making sense, is when you're underwriting it, trying to identify things like that. So let me give you a very practical example of what I was talking about. They own a resort, the Margaritaville in Lake of the Ozarks. It's a very seasonal asset right now because of the way the loan docs are written. And it was just not connecting the dots. Right. They are getting put into a cash trap where the lender and the special servicer is holding $1.5 million of income that they desperately need. Right. They can't access that income because they're in a cash trap because of certain things around seasonality and the way reward points work, which is that I won't get into the details of that, but so now then they said, ok, well, what are we going to do about this? This is, like, ridiculous. We can't manage, like, through this cash situation. So they the asset manager and the gc, right? We're in the room and they said, yes, we called Goldman, who is the original lender on this asset, right? And raised holy hell. We talked to the gc, right, an attorney to go back through and read all the debt provisions and covenants. And we're going to. In that case, it's tri mon, I think. But what I did also learn is there's really only three servicers right now that a lot of the hotel world is dealing with, which is Tri Mot, Midland and Key Bank. And they're like, so we're going to Trymont. Right. With Goldman in hand saying, you know, like, this does not work for our borrower, which I thought was a very interesting story, right, because it's the lenders who we want who are going to be issuing the loans, right? As clients. So that was just a really I just listening to them talk and understanding how big of a problem that was for them. I mean, if we can create solutions to problems like that, because we have access into data. Right. That others don't, we really could be helping the industry and then start to bring advocates to the table for us. I also, and this is like, I'm really trying to figure out who does what when you're sitting in a room with 15 people and it's the first time they've ever met you, and you're only like a part time, you know, today a week helper. But there was a young man who works on the management company side in finance. He is the one that personally sends all of Driftwood's data to CBRE's benchmark product. He's the one that does it. Hits the send button right on it. So we were talking and I said, what a shame that C. Beren is setting down benchmark. And he agreed. And he went on to explain the 15 challenges he has using only his own portfolio data for benchmarking in underwriting and in management company performance. Right. Which is that their assets don't often. Sometimes they're buying a hotel where their existing assets just don't have the right comparables because they're very different type of asset. He gave an example of like, well, how do I underwrite a courtyard that maybe has 10,000 courtyards, probably. How do I underwrite an element that's a better example, which is a Marriott Extended Stay brand, when Maybe you have 10,000 square feet of meeting space, because that doesn't exist in our portfolio? Right now we don't have any assets like that. Right. So I can't draw on my own portfolios, comps to underwrite that correctly. And so he was, he went on to talk about all the challenges he has with comms. And then at the end, I asked him, well, if we were able to salvage C. Beren's benchmark. That would be valuable to you, Right. His name is Dan. And he said yes, because then when I'm underwriting, if I need comps that are different than what my own portfolio can provide. Right. And again, these are aggregated, anonymized comps, then that would be. And it was in software. It was actually within the SaaS. Right. So you literally can just pull it up on the fly. That would be incredibly helpful to him. This week, I am camped out, and when I go into their office in a few minutes, I'm literally camped out outside Mani's office, their chief technology officer. So I am going to make sure that I get as much time with him as humanly possible to kind of just pick his brain and be nice and try to show that I can be of value and try to show that we can be of value as well. Right. I am going to get time with. I'm just trying to walk through the people that I'm going to get time with. I'm working very closely with the asset management person, and I'm going to try to sit down with Pranav again, who I think is the first person that I could be wrong on this. Like, how do we start now to bring regular conversations into the mix? And then I'm going to go find out who runs their debt and structured finance platform, which I have not. He was not in that meeting. And see if we could sit down and since they're already a safe node investor in us, just give us some really candid feedback. Right. When they're lending, what are they looking at? Like, what would they need? In an underwriting tool. And that's where I'm going to stop talking. But I'm just going to connect the dots back to that hotel operations guy. Because they're vertically integrated, Shop, and they do all these different things, right? They're an investor, they're a lender, they're. A management company. He said, this young guy on the management team who is very data literate, surprisingly, wonderfully data literate, but he said, yes, well, I'll sometimes work with the debt team as well, because if they're lending on a hotel and they're getting into something in the underwriting that they just can't figure out, they will call me and get my feedback on it. Also, he said, when they get into a situation where the loan isn't going well and they may need to go into special servicing, they call me to get my advice on if the problem is fixable or not. Right. So you're just starting to see like this is making sense. I am going to try to get in front of the person who I hope sits in Miami, because they don't all sit in Miami, but if not, I'm getting closer to it. That we could have some conversations with about. All right, if we were. If you were to use us, like, immediately for your underwriting, what would it need to look like? And then I lied. I do have one other thing that I think could be potentially helpful to us. Driftwood is going to put three assets on the market this year and would never want to do anything to mess up their sale process because I'm worried that they're not going to hit the prices that they need to hit in order to transact on these hotels. But that's their problem, right? I'm just thinking of it as an observer. And that what you call. The customer experience, right? Like customer. What do you call journey? That's what you called it, right? The customer journey. So here we go. This is the moment. They're sitting in a meeting, a budget meeting, and say, ok, we're going to go sell these three hotels because of these reasons. You know, we need a. Really great, you know, exit success story. We have one that's underperforming and we think we just need to get out of it. And then we need cash, which is another one we'll provide. So what happens from here? Right. They reach out to three brokers. They have to send the information to the brokers, right? This is where we go. This information is getting sent right now out of profit, soared into Excel files to the brokers. The brokers are uploading this information into their Excel miles, Excel models and creating a bov. They're sending the bovs back to Driftwood for Driftwood to review, right? Like it's the beginning. This is the exact moment in time. That's the beginning of what I almost consider our workflow process. Right. Is ok, there's a hotel that's potentially going to exchange hands, so follow that workflow through the whole thing and you've got the customer journey for so. Many different players of our Personas of the owner, right? In this case, it's a seller of the broker, of the management company, of the lenders, right? It's just. It's like dead on. What we need to be doing to follow the customer journey. So it is 18 after and I talked for a full 15 minutes without giving you. Without a breath and giving you even a moment to respond, but. It's been a. I think this is going to be a really great relationship for us, and I just need to do a little bit more work to get to the right people within Driftwood. It's not something I can ask Carlos Jr to do because Carlos Jr they are confidentially between us, they are bringing in a new head of operations, and he's in the middle of a search for that role, which is very difficult. Right. And they have to get through some recaps and they've got to put these hotels on the market. And so Carlos is just flying at a really high level. But when I can get to people on his team that are the day to day leads of these different kind of workflows. And you know, I can get to the management company person, I can get to the debt person, I can get to the acquisition person and the asset management person, and to Mani, the chief technology officer. That's when I see us having a much more dynamic, you know, IRL relationship with them as the customer and as the, you know, advisor for us. Ok. So I just, I ramble. But that is all very positive things that I see, especially around our I'll say if we can resurrect this benchmark product, it could be just such an accelerator for us into 26 and how we roll out InnVestAI because we have this one unique moment in time that will never exist again. Never, ever exist again. Where CBRE is literally abandoned a product and to people within our network are the ones that. Built that product and still have the relationships with all the people that are sending the data. Right. So all we need to do, and this is when we talk to Mark next week. It's like, ok, we need a plan on how. Well, one. I think it's that this is the part where they would be a partner of ours, right? So they're gonna get something in exchange for this. They're not gonna do this for free. Is like bring their relationships to the table. Right. And I don't wanna go outside of having a conversation with all the partners about that, but it's almost like we have to act in December very quickly before the product totally just gets shelved. Right. There's no place to send the data and go out into December and have Mark and Robert Baum and someone from our side just go down the list. It's like, 50 groups that are sending the data. Hey, would you consider continuing to send the data to us? Because, you know Mark and you know Robert, you've worked with them for 30 years, right? We're gonna. We're gonna create a new version of Benchmarker, but just don't disconnect. The data send, and then if we could have a little bit of time to work through how they are receiving the data and aggregating it, right then I think Q1 could, we could spend some time on just trying to now bring that data in where we're processing it, and once we're processing it, Once we're processing it, and we have 50 potential groups out there sending us data, that would be, again, like something I had never really dreamed could happen as quickly as it possibly can. Okay, now I really am gonna shut up because it's 22 after, so thank you for letting me ramble.

### You (2025-11-18T15:22:18.517Z)

It's very encouraging. I did have a couple conversations over the weekend over various things. This was one of them. And he made a very good point. It's like you don't just pull the plug. On a product without getting the existing clients advanced notice. So it will be great to undirect benchmarking. But it would be even better if we would retain the clients. I don't know how we can do that.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:22:51.553Z)

Yes, we can retain the clients. We can because. Well, can we can. Like me, little Diane Fox. Not potentially, but can Mark Woodworth and Robert Mandelbaum. Yes. Because it's like they. It was their baby 30 years ago. Right. And people know them, love them in the industry. And I think we could retain those relationships. I do. I do think it's. I know it's hard for me to explain. Why to you. But if we act quickly, I think we can do it.

### You (2025-11-18T15:23:27.077Z)

I understand the relationship part, but here. 's what we think would be the absolute best scenario. Is that we can actually negotiate something with cbre. We don't let the money to buy it. Would they be willing to stay on? Or transition over somebody else, but still retain a percentage of ownership, have access to the tool for free. How can we structure that so that we have continuous service? It might be too late. Clients. Clients, if they're a contract expires on December 31st. We give the same position of having just go inside them. Back up again. Also, if we can just transition ownership. We don't have to go and rebuild anything. We would have to. Just create the mechanism to get the data from the existing database. Into. An InnVestAI. Database. So that we just maintain everything. That's the conversation you have with Mark and Bill. That would be the best solution. But if we have to replicate it and larc and we'll start all over, that's not bad on you because. There is more software product out there. Where? The developers would love. Would. Everyone have a chance to do it over again? To make it better. So it might not be that bad of I don't think either one of them. Is negative with either one of them.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:25:16.993Z)

Just figuring out how practically how to do it right.

### You (2025-11-18T15:25:22.037Z)

It's like the other $6 million man show back in the 70s. We can rebuild them and make it better.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:25:29.953Z)

The major, right? Yes. Bionic woman. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-18T15:25:31.397Z)

Yeah. So that's an option. That's good news. My conversations with Granola. That's. Somebody just kind of touched on that real quick. It's definitely a good news. Bad news. Situation. Wonder Woman said people Humaniac talked last night. She mentioned that. Live and urging are really kind of focusing. On the. Adm. But she won is looking into. More of the AI things. And trying to find too many, some of the data stretching on a financial statement. So he's also starting to work on extraction from documents. So what you're talking about? Like the long terms and those gotchas and things we want. To. That's the exact scenario. We would want to focus on. Just let them drag and drop the worm package, and we would extract all of that information. Marvel's period. What reports have to be sent to the lenders? Those items in addition to how much of it, what's the interest rate, what are your payments, et cetera, et cetera. So we can work on all that? So I really think the whole AI Are more important than I thought it would. With my most recent day. I mean, if he was already working on some of that, we're months ahead. The bad news. So Bernadette and I discussed. What? Possible actions could we take to make sure we keep the group together? If any. So we decided to. Set up a card industry withdrew. Because I know he. 's kind of aligned with Mark. Right. So we figured if the three of us could have a good discussion, Without yourself and Larc just to see is there a possibility of what could we possibly do you know why Both conversion that call that there's nothing we can do. So I didn't do was. Align with mark. But I thought he. Was probably. Going to be more open minded. But he basically made a comment during that call that he's probably just as frustrated with Mark on how things are going to be handled. How it's been taking so long for the llc, all the back and forth on these things, and I don't think. Drew. Is wanting to continue. Either.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:28:32.833Z)

Okay? So we need a way asap to pay software engineers.

### You (2025-11-18T15:28:40.197Z)

We need that money from Redwood. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:28:42.993Z)

Yep. Okay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:28:44.117Z)

We're just going to have to go to this stuff. He's not going to fund December that he's done. Go ahead and continue a little bit with what else was discussed.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:28:44.193Z)

And. Right.

### You (2025-11-18T15:29:02.437Z)

Lar. C last week put together an email with nine points. Last week when we talked, I mentioned what he said. Something that he wasn't claimed. To sign the LLC unless certain things were. Changed. And I replied back. Fine. What specifically needs to change? And he sent back an email with nine points. We are reviewed, it reidentified that there's probably, I don't know, maybe three points that are legitimate items that should be addressed in the llc, and then the other ones are just more operational that they don't even really need to be in the llc. And so I think everybody agreed. So this is the point where I'm going to say that. Need. To promise you will never, ever speak of this conversation with anybody. There's a couple of things that came out of that call. Number one. You're going to get an email from do, and it's going to basically say, Here's what we're excited. Either sign it or don't. If. You don't sign with, then there is. A belief with you and Mark that we're more normal state by giving everybody equal shares. And that. We could, the four of us, sign the llc? Basically take over the company. You would still have your 20% but be a non vot. Ing member. I won't do that. But that was what was discussed. Because I'm getting the back of my head. You're not going to sign something like that. So otherwise. Indexed disintegrates. We also made the comment because I made a comment like, well, if we do something like that, We're going to have to start all over again. A new name. Ein. All that stuff. We've already got that. We have the Ein to see. The four of us. We don't have to do anything. We went on thinking. We're forgetting that it's all under Diane.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:31:34.353Z)

Oh, they're trying to kick me out? Is that what you're saying? Yes.

### You (2025-11-18T15:31:39.317Z)

Kick you out of the operations.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:31:42.673Z)

Because they don't like me and they think I'm. I make too many. Yes. Okay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:31:42.997Z)

You would be. It's not that they don't like you. They just don't think that you are leading the company or you're making decisions on your own without consulting everybody. So conversation in my head last week. So that's where that aligns. The very nice look afterwards in our call the Multilayer. We're not going to sign a document that excludes you from anything in the business. So, I mean, what are the down to us the idea that you floated last week. Of whether you started parent company or whatever, we're going to have to. Assume, basically, for this Florida, it's going to be just the three of us.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:32:39.553Z)

That's. Well, it's disappointing for Drew, but, I mean, that is what it is. Right if he says okay, so just keep going. So please. So we're gonna have to, the three of us, keep going.

### You (2025-11-18T15:32:52.277Z)

Doesn't mean that there's a 100% possibility that drew will not join us. He is. You can tell he is very frustrated with the amount of time that he's put into this. All works on back and forth and everything. We heard he never did that, so it was possible that he could continue to work with us. As long as we can assure him that. We weren't expecting to do something, so maybe he continued on as. A board member. Smaller normal equity. And the three of us continue just with the day to day operations. And. The only thing that I think would really suffer from if he left was that lack of integration was larc. I think the benchmarker is probably good. I haven't seen it. I don't know if that would.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:33:53.313Z)

Larc, won't they? If we bring the right people to the table, LARC will still integrate with us. That isn't dependent on Drew. I feel really confident about that. It just means you have to bring you owners who have a big say and like their product.

### You (2025-11-18T15:33:54.597Z)

Just. Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:34:09.793Z)

And can I ask you. And I'm just gonna jump to a couple really practical things. Number one. And I. It is what it is. I'm not, like, trying to question. I just want to make sure I can start to think about how to fund it. Drew has been spending is sending about 1400amonth to Vinod. It goes up to 6000. What is the amount Beno needs per month over the next six months to keep the software engineering team.

### You (2025-11-18T15:34:39.317Z)

Take a look at the budget. File. It's on the team. Sorry. If you go to the InnVestAI channel under the file, and then there's performing there.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:34:47.153Z)

Right. And I did. It just. It goes up to 6k. And so I just want to. Is it 6k or was 6k just some sort of placeholder?

### You (2025-11-18T15:34:49.157Z)

Yeah. It was a placeholder to also assuming that we're going to hire a couple of AI specialists.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:35:03.553Z)

Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:35:05.397Z)

We did need to increase the pay.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:35:06.113Z)

But can I ask the question? So if Driftwood. The money we're getting from Driftwood. Right. If I could say $4,000 of it per month goes to Vinod to pay software engineering costs. And maybe even there's some amount from November and December that I can give extra. And it's through March. Right. And I think I can get them to continue with another 75k safe note after March. Is that enough for him to keep the three engineers he has engaged on board?

### You (2025-11-18T15:35:46.117Z)

To keep the three would be good.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:35:46.273Z)

Okay? Okay? My next question is.

### You (2025-11-18T15:35:49.637Z)

In fact, I think it'd be less than 4,000. But keep in mind, if you're going to be taking 8,500amonth, that's 51,000. That one beds 24,000, which is 4,000amonth. So that entire stage note would go to salaries and would not help us with. Development in any. Way.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:36:11.473Z)

Right. And I'm trying to think about maybe Mark Woodworth could be at again, like, is I think through, like, funding and partnership. Right. But my next very practical question is how much are we going to need to repay Drew and Mark?

### You (2025-11-18T15:36:12.197Z)

We're going to decide.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:36:27.473Z)

Because I assume we're going to have to repay them something at the interest rate of 5.75, which they have in the. In the budget.

### You (2025-11-18T15:36:28.917Z)

It's about your. Debt that's in the budget as well. But he's got a low in there about how much they've put in, so he's got a funding level at the top.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:36:39.793Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T15:36:47.237Z)

And then the expenses down below. I don't know what that actually nets out to me. But it's in that budget. So just take a look at that when you have a chance. I don't have it pulled up and don't remember the numbers off the top of my head. If people. Get more money. And we're good.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:37:07.633Z)

Yeah. Look, I. If I can walk, if I can take less of the driftwood money, I will take less of the driftwood money. You guys, I. I mean. I'm. I'm emb to explain my financial situation, but I'm highly confident that Mark Woodworth would be willing to contribute financially to the salvaging of benchmarker. And when I mean what I mean in my mind there is he's got to bring this gentleman named Robert Mandelbaum. On because Robert is the one who managed the entire product for cbre, Right. And he's really, like, almost besties with Mark. So Mark will need to pay for Robert out of Mark's own pocket. But that adds tremendous value to us. But I don't think it would be outside of. Outside of. Reason for me to ask Mark. To contribute $2,000 $3,000 a month to help with support or software engineering team. Especially if we're going to be a lot of this is going to be talking about how do we now start to ingest this data. Right. And you said this early on and I went back and forth with you, but you were right. At the end of the day, like the value. I thought Drew was going to add was around Data. All along, I thought it was around data, like ingesting data, like. Right. But the value Drew is really brought is in testing the product in my mind and being right. I can find another person to test the product. That is not. I mean. But he's added very little when it comes to actually, how do we. Like pull. And I thought we would be pulling data through hotel biz. What you and Vano told me over and over again is know just have it go through. InnVestAI first. The data needs to go through. And you were 100% right on that. And this would give us the opportunity to do that. Like to have the data come through InnVestAI. And right now, that data, I'm sure it's being very messily sent in. But the solution is APIs. We just now say, okay, this product is big enough that it could support us asking for an API integration. We don't want it to go through. Profit soared because we don't want profit. Sort of controlled our destiny like that. We just want to work on creating API integrations with. A bridge. Which is a thousand hotels, Right, Maria? Which is 2,000 hotels. Like one little API. And we construct a pull in the data with those managers. And I'm just talking for a moment. So do you think I get sued? Do you? I mean, do you think Mark and Drew sue me in any way or they would just walk away and feel like they'd cut me, cut the legs out from under me?

### You (2025-11-18T15:40:05.717Z)

Never get that come up in the conversation. We never discussed what happens, what worst case scenario.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:40:16.753Z)

And then can I ask one more question?

### You (2025-11-18T15:40:18.597Z)

I don't know. So again, Canva's vector conversation last week that maybe.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:40:18.753Z)

Yeah. Ok?

### You (2025-11-18T15:40:25.637Z)

We continue to give them equity. Non voting equity. A small amount, not 20%. But something saying, ok, here's some equity for the work that you've done. Up to this point. We're going to separate. You don't have any say in the operations or anything else, but you. Worry. Based on this percentage of equity. And that's it. Instead of just. I'm just afraid that if we just clearly say no, we're going to reboot the llc.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:41:03.233Z)

Ay.

### You (2025-11-18T15:41:05.157Z)

And you got to either take it or leave it. And they obviously will leave it. They get absolutely nothing for what they've done to this point. Then there's a chance that we could get a call or a letter.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:41:15.313Z)

You're right. You're right. You're 100% right. Can I ask you another question? I mean, do you and Vinod have confidence that the three of us can do this, or do you question my ability to move this product forward as much as Marc and Drew do?

### You (2025-11-18T15:41:37.637Z)

No, I think the motorway are perfectly fine. One of the things I do feel that we would have to. Be all three of us involved in every decision. Just like the issue that Drew kept bringing up is the fact that he thinks that you went rogue. You made these agreements. You did all the things. Without anybody signing. We talked about the fact that anytime that we have any type of a safe note, it has to require more than one signature from the company, which actually, I brought up that one. I do believe that we should make sure that that is clearly understood before we go any further. But yeah. It would basically shrink from 5 to 3, much more manageable.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:42:38.993Z)

Y.

### You (2025-11-18T15:42:39.317Z)

We just keep it simple.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:42:39.473Z)

Ep.

### You (2025-11-18T15:42:41.237Z)

A majority need to prove their. If there's any. So if not any induction in the company. To me, it just makes sense that, yeah, we need to. Be involved in the accrual of it, right? So we need to know what the valuation is, what the trainings are. Clarity on that. 's fine. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:43:06.753Z)

Okay? And I'm good with that. You know, this was like, well, that's a Hail Mary passes as I think of it, but I know you guys think of it differently. It sounds like there's an email coming where Drew and Mark are going to propose that the company essentially kind of keep me in economically, but remove me from any kind of real. Role, right? Like real voting role.

### You (2025-11-18T15:43:44.117Z)

That's only if you refuse to sign the llc.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:43:47.073Z)

Okay? And I am going to refuse to sign the llc. I mean, right?

### You (2025-11-18T15:43:47.877Z)

If you agree. That's why I knew that. So, yeah, if you were to sign with them. Five founders, 20%.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:43:58.273Z)

And they're playing. That's right. I mean, that's. I don't really think that's. Well, anyway, I can't sign the llc. And again, I loved Heru. I don't. I think Mark is a bad seed and it'll hurt us long term. But we didn't. There's so many things that are left open. What jobs are we actually going to do? Like, how is the part time, full time thing? Like, there's too many open things in my mind for us to truly be able to sign that llc. So I'm. They're going to send that out. You knew it. I'm going to refuse to sign the llc. Then they are going to propose that the four of you move forward with the llc. With me and some sort of silent position, right? And then it comes down to us saying, all right, this is. We're at an impasse. How do we figure out, like, how to potentially go forward? We understand that, but what is really going to take take it is is you and vinod if you'd rather go with Mark and Drew or if you'd rather try to stay with me. And then, like, and I'll agree, like, if there's a role for them to have turn the money that they've invested into a safe note at a five million dollar pre money valuation. Right. Like so that they're on the same terms as Driftwood.

### You (2025-11-18T15:45:19.877Z)

Sure.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:45:22.833Z)

That's seems very fair and reasonable to me. Do they get a little bit of extra? Equity in the company, even though they're not going to be part of the day to day going forward because of the year that they've spent on it. Almost like I there's some language that I can share with you around what it is all day long, but if we can negotiate some sort of separational, most right. It's like. Like a separation arrangement. I really think we should keep quiet the benchmark thing to just you and Benoit and I at this point. Because I don't want them locking like I don't want them to impede the r the three of us are ability to move quickly. Through something that could be really a game changer for. For us to move forward. And then I'm going to just say, like, I feel really strongly. I did learn something. I can't give up 40% of the equity of this company to people who aren't going to work full time. Like there has to. It has to go to people that are going to want to work. Right, Howard, like we're going. Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T15:46:40.517Z)

So, yeah, that all makes sense. And nobody has mentioned anything. And like I said, Bonoboi had our one on one every Monday. He's not going to. Sign. An agreement that doesn't include you. So it's not a choice between whether we go with Lark and Drew, whether we stay with you, I mean. That. We've made that decision already, so don't worry about that. Important. Number one. The conversation never took place.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:47:14.993Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-11-18T15:47:15.477Z)

And number two. That we need to kind of. At least endure size. Continue moving as we have planned. More mentioned nothing else. So one thing that I would encourage is I think the relationship with Bill and Mark is essential. We need to do that. We need to focus on driftwood. But. I really also think that we need to get Jessica involved in some way, shape or form. We need an advisor who then geared and done. That. In a car with me. And I learned from the note yesterday he had a one on one with Vidard as well. And he kept talking about. He seems the only one who started the business. He's the only one who's been to this and sold business. And I both kind of chuckled like, well, Never started the software business. You don't know anything about Seth. And that's where Jessica would come in. I see. Jessica. As basically. Taking the role that Mark saw he had and being 100 times more effective.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:48:33.073Z)

I agree. Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T15:48:34.997Z)

I'm not worried about industry contacts. I don't think LARC's gonna be a detriment long term. I'm not opposed to. If things are so well as driftwood and they want to. Buy us and bring them more. I mean, there's all sorts of alternatives. And I can tell you that the vast majority of software obsessed startups pivot at some point. What they envision on day one. To what they are at the time that. They. Start making money. Is very rarely the same thing. There's always a point in the journey where something comes up and you're either doing something wrong. And you need to change it, or there's a bigger opportunity. In the adjacent space and you just pivot.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:49:30.513Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-18T15:49:30.917Z)

So if.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:49:30.993Z)

And Howard, if it's the three of us, I'm. I am comfortable getting a call with Prana. Like, I mean, I would say yesterday, right? But this week is all budgets, and next week is a holiday week. But, like, I would be, like, literally yesterday if it were you and Benoit and myself talking to pranab that, like, can have, like, immediate. My concern has been the negativity that Mark brings to the table would come through and make us look really bad. Right. And so Mark would want to control the whole thing and. The conversations and like his ego would kick in. And so. So as far as why I mentioned that is Driftwood may be willing to write a check for more than 75k. They have things they need. Right. Like this whole cash flow thing that I've been talking about can be solved with software. I'm confident of it. There's nothing that doesn't work. It's just. It's math. Right? It's. It's just math, and it's. All this math is being done, yeah.

### You (2025-11-18T15:50:28.357Z)

You have encouraged me about those conversations.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:50:32.353Z)

And so that might be enough to pay you and pave an ode. Right. And then like help us like where we are helping them with some of their problems and their supporting both the view as well. And then. So. And I. Yeah, go ahead.

### You (2025-11-18T15:50:48.277Z)

Well. Here's the thing to keep in mind. Whatever problems experience will be. There are many others in the industry experiencing the exact same problems. So there's very rarely anything unique in their workflow. That wouldn't apply to others. So if we focus on solving the drift world problem, we're going to solve the problem for a bunch of others as well.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:51:16.673Z)

Yes. Yes, yes.

### You (2025-11-18T15:51:19.397Z)

That's why I'm not worried about that. Because Market viewer made comments more times or any one particular company. And I understand what they're saying, and we don't want to focus on one company. But the problems are problems with everybody. So I would encourage you, while you're here, take advantage of. As much time. Go ahead. And pick Benny's brain and all the wrong people you're here with because. I think a week from today, we're going to have a much clearer path of what we can do for them. And what you mentioned is. Like I said. What? Siobhan was working well. And it's total coincidence. Nobody told when to go and do that. He just went on his own. Extracting data from documents. We could continue to work on that over the holidays. We could potentially have something very early in 2026that would help them out, and then, yeah, at that point they're going to say, okay, here's another 75k or whatever. Want to. Be 500k. That. That's what we need to focus on right now, along with Lark and Bill and I think. Whether it's a 5050 partnership or however we want to structure it, I would say those are the things that we need. Diane had to do. Focus on those conversations with Driftwood. And let's keep talking to Mark and Bill. Like I said, you coordinated. You have those calls. Without Lark and Drew having any involvement. That doesn't make any difference at this point. But I just think that's probably the best path forward at this point.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:53:09.633Z)

Okay? Okay? All good. There is been ode afraid of being sued after his conversation with Mark. Did that fear go away based on. I mean, I'm just curious where his head is.

### You (2025-11-18T15:53:23.957Z)

Yeah, I think he's okay because I just passed him point blank. How are things going at Morgan? Is there any possibility that. You could be out of a job. Or that your contract expires and they don't renew it. Because I want him full time. But we're making progress. Not as fast as we want, but if we focus on one specific Persona, like the lender. And get that knocked out. The developers, they want to work more. And so if we've got money in the budget to increase the pay, given the benefits, Granola is already working our way. We could possibly get them to pick up the pace. And I think we'd be okay. The world hasn't mentioned anything else. And I think if we just simply. Approach this in good faith. Even though I know you're not going to execute the agreement. But let's go through your emotions. Have conversations. And one thing will break down. I don't think it's an effort.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:54:41.633Z)

It's a win, right?

### You (2025-11-18T15:54:42.677Z)

Yeah. Don't restart saying, ok, we're going to move on. And then like you said with the two of them, say, ok, if you want to continue to be involved, We'll convert your. Investment so far into a safe mode. And we'll give you, I would say, start low and negotiate like 3 to 5% equity like we would a key employee in the company. And that will be in exchange for what you've done up to this point. And at that time, that's what we'll see. If Mark starts thinking out and threatening lawsuits to me. That.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:55:26.353Z)

And, you know, you. You met the young man Jeremy, right. On Mark's team. Because he's right, and Mark really likes Jer. Jeremy could do the role that Drew is doing.

### You (2025-11-18T15:55:26.357Z)

He could. He did well, right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:55:40.673Z)

Jeremy could do the testing and the date like he. He could do that tomorrow. Like that is not like. So again, where I thought Drew would be bringing in more value with the data, but this gives us an opportunity to just set the data up as a direct transfer. So one thing, though. I want to make sure that I'M not going rogue is when I talk about a partnership with Mark. Right. Woodwork on this. It's almost like if he's an investor in our company, he won't see a dime for a long period of time. Right. But if we say okay. And I would. I would ask him to be an investor in our company. But if we were to say, okay, Mark, This would be a revenue share, right? So the minute we get our software up and running, or even before then, if people just want to use the comparable somehow, then we're going to share in the revenue generation that we create from salvaging Benchmarker. And it's not like you'd be getting 5% of that because they're bringing a lot to the table. Does this make sense? They're bringing the relationships and we're bringing the future. We're bringing, like, the integrations to software. We're bringing, like, potentially how to process the data via API. But it would have to be a meaningful partnership. So I just want you to think about that. Right. I would never get Drew and Mark to agree on a number. We. I would just see us going, like, round and round and round. But it might need to be like, ok, for every. There's a base price for the product. And then if a customer uses benchmark, there's an add on cost for it. Right? Like maybe. Right. And they got 50% of that add on cost. Right. And we get 50% of that add on cost for a period of time. I'm just. I'm just trying to make it something simple. Maybe it's less than that, but that's kind of how I see the. The mod like how to propose a partnership strategy where they can see potential revenue.

### You (2025-11-18T15:57:22.117Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:57:46.913Z)

Fairly immediately off of the work and what they're bringing to the table.

### You (2025-11-18T15:57:51.557Z)

That's exactly what I was going to say is that it should be a cross selling opportunity where we are. Partners. And each other. Would. Offer. The services and the revenue. So we would take InnVestAI clients. And give them the opportunity to. Also subscribe to them. Same thing for them if they've got any benchmark reclined and then they could sell. InnVestAI on top of it. And that's. Yeah, that's exactly where the revenue would go.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:58:26.033Z)

And we're partnered, though, on this new benchmarker product. Like, we're probably 50, 50 partners in the data itself, right?

### You (2025-11-18T15:58:29.797Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:58:34.913Z)

Yeah. And mark is.

### You (2025-11-18T15:58:36.917Z)

That's what I'm thinking as well. There would be more of an integration behind the scenes because we've already got. The data extraction process. Boring. I haven't seen their back end yet. But it's possible we could have a single. Back end data extraction.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:58:56.433Z)

Yes. Yes, we could.

### You (2025-11-18T15:58:59.157Z)

If they have two different systems, which is very difficult to maintain.

### Guest (2025-11-18T15:59:01.153Z)

I. Yes, we should actually. That we should be pushed very hard on that. Right. One single integration, however poorer. Robert Mandelbaum. Right. Is getting all that information. We just go ask those clients to continue to send it. Right. It's just gonna get sent to a different location probably since C. Beren is abandoned it but. If Robert is still involved personally, right? We can say we can go to each one of those data providers. Instead of sending the data to wherever you are now, you're gonna send it here, make that one change. Know it's gonna take us three plus months to get the new product up and running. We then go back and say, okay, this is a manual process, so let's develop API integrations to get this data in Right? And we talk about the future of. Right. And then we push really hard with Mark Woodworth that there's only one. I'm saying the same thing as you write that the data processing is happening in one place, and we're the ones controlling that with from a software engineering perspective. But we can't do without their relationships with those data providers, right?

### You (2025-11-18T16:00:03.637Z)

Yeah. So essentially, it could almost act like one company on the back end. Of the climate facing where you'd have, like a marker in the family that's AI.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:00:24.433Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-18T16:00:25.317Z)

How will that. They don't care. And they don't have to know the specifics. And the one who want to find out is even though CDI is stopping it, they may own the IP to this. So that might prevent Lark and Bill. From building the exact replica. So that might be an advantage in this whole situation is that if we do the data extraction, that might separate the IP issues so that they know that in any legal trouble with C. Beren, right? So we won't want to copy it. Code for code. But if we did something that basically has the same output,

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:01:06.993Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-18T16:01:12.117Z)

That's something we proceed to talk to Mark and Bill about. I'm sure they're already well aware of that. What they can. Or could not do. And we can.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:01:21.393Z)

Yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-11-18T16:01:22.197Z)

Take it from there.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:01:23.713Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And we. And in there, that would be Mark and Robert Benton Mandelbaum. But. Okay. Well, thank you. I know this is probably a difficult conversation for you. Majority of this conversation was never had. I completely recognized that if I show up at this 5:30 call today because I can't have a 5:30 call turn into a three hour session when I'm here in Miami, am I better just saying I can't talk until next Tuesday or am I better showing up. Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T16:02:00.437Z)

As well. Circulated. He would circulate the email that he was going to send. But he basically just said, are we all bringing it? But I said this to Diane and everything else. And everybody said, Yeah. Fine, go ahead. But I also mentioned that you are in Miami this week working on budgets with Driftwood and that you likely, number one, wouldn't have time to review the LLC. And number two. Probably when. People are joining the calls because that. So I kind of gave you one out already.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:02:36.913Z)

Thank you. I can't have a three hour when I'm trying to stay focused and do the things I need to do this week, so. Okay.

### You (2025-11-18T16:02:46.037Z)

Yeah. I think it would be best for you just to say, worth the travel and working on the bubbles that you don't have, you can tell them that you've got. Meetings that conflict or whatever you want to do.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:03:06.593Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-11-18T16:03:06.837Z)

But yeah. We can take a look at the email.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:03:12.673Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T16:03:12.677Z)

S have to say. And then talk about it next week if we want to. Bottom line is, in my opinion, we need to go full scene ahead on these conversations. Lark and wool. Everybody that you can speak to. A driftwood and Jessica. Let's run. Let's see if we can get everything. Behind the scenes, you and me. And. The worst case scenario. Which. Is the most likely. Outcome of this whole thing. And how we can go forward. Yes, I'm trying to think of. I do not have any attorney contact. Just to even have an off the record 10 minute. What potential liability. Could we possibly face in this situation where we don't have an executed llc? It's all been verbal. Would there be any? Could there be any issues? I don't know if you have any money you could talk to?

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:04:27.313Z)

Yeah, I did reach out to Harvard Business Services, who was the company I used to like, incorporate and you know, like they're a full service company to see if they would know someone we could talk to. I don't know, I might go just into. It's not like Berec's bank was like, on it, like, you know what I mean? Harvard Business Services looks like it's a dinosaur of a company. But I do wanna. I mean, we handle this correctly, it may be. I mean, we never even want to talk about litigation, right? We just want to basically almost have Mark, Andrew want to divorce themselves from us, right? And voluntarily divorce themselves because they we can't come to agreement on the llc, but then feel like they've gotten a pound of flesh. Out of this because they've gotten still some sort of economic investment or something along those lines, right?

### You (2025-11-18T16:05:19.637Z)

That's what I'm hoping. I mean, even if it's 3 to 5%. I mean, if. That could be a very nice payday. At the end of the day. Distributions, whatever. If we do get to that unicorn status, it would be very happy. With 3 or 5% or something like that.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:05:40.833Z)

And then do we pay back then? But then we're not paying back what they've already invested. That is what becomes their investment, right?

### You (2025-11-18T16:05:50.357Z)

I kind of like the idea of the first offer should be. Converted to a safe note. So that they get the lynch note. But I would say that plus just. An inequity share that's not tied to the safe note. Like we would with the key employee. Right. So they've got. Two avenues of profiting. So they can convert the safeguard into shared at a later time. And they also have just the. Five. Basically 5% or whatever. 3% non voting equity.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:06:27.953Z)

Not each, though, right? Each. That's so much.

### You (2025-11-18T16:06:33.557Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:06:35.713Z)

Think about it, okay? Like, I'm. I don't.

### You (2025-11-18T16:06:40.597Z)

I don't know, but it's just. Like. How much is it worth? To have a clean preparation. Right. But like I say, it's all worship. We could go in at 1%, they could come back at 10, who knows? But, yeah, if we make it clear that we're open to negotiations, that decision that we think is a good way for them to recover money. 10 times over. More than that. Plus have long term equity. And just sort of. Hey, look, you have to do.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:07:17.633Z)

Or, if they don't want to do that, to walk away. And they could be a competitor to us. And we completely understand. They've heard every single thing we've done over the past year. They have a lot. I mean, like, they could go create a competitive product. I don't think Mark understands the product well enough in his mind to do it, nor do I think. Drew does actually like. Not the way you and I understand it. Because we're aligned on the fact that this is a CRE Fintech product, right? That is targeted at hospitality, where they think it's a hotel technology company of some kind and don't understand.

### You (2025-11-18T16:07:56.837Z)

I'm not going to say it's not a concern, but it's a very minor concern. At this point because, yeah, Drew is still struggling. He had his own company. I don't think he would take on. Any type of development of another product. And you're right. Mark is not a software guy. I don't know. I don't think he would know where to start.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:08:19.953Z)

Okay? All right. Well, I'm glad we kept this call. Thank you. Just let them know because it is true. I'm gonna like I once I walk into their doors. In a few minutes. I belong to them until end of day Thursday. And all I can do is just do the best I can do. And find these people internally that will help us and things along those lines, so. And IU will have the call, and then you guys will just talk about, like, agreeing on what Drew's gonna send in an email. Is that what you guys will be doing? Or you'll go through the regular where you talked about the product.

### You (2025-11-18T16:08:54.997Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:09:01.553Z)

How the group is gonna distribute out the comments on the LLC and their concerns. Okay?

### You (2025-11-18T16:09:10.437Z)

I'm not even sure. If. I mean, yeah, I'm sure we'll probably have some type of a meeting, but. Yeah, we'll be fine. I mean, Beren and I, we. Like I said, we're in agreement. We're going to go through the motions. Of following and working with Drew and Mark. But. Knowing at the end it's not going to work out. We're not going to raise any concerns or make any changes or do whatever it's like. Ok. Yeah, let's go ahead. With your plan. And we'll take it from there.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:09:48.113Z)

And I know, I'm sorry, I keep adding on another minute, but Benode was he. Because I was so concerned about his concern about getting sued last week. Like, I, like that's been, like, going through my mind over and over again. He can't be prone to that type of risk. And I know he really, really likes Drew. So he. I mean, walk me through again. When he heard Drew's stance on things. Kind of. How did he feel about it again? Like how? Like, what do you think he walked away with from compared to what our conversation was last Thursday?

### You (2025-11-18T16:10:25.717Z)

When you and I soak afterwards. He will kind of surprise. Like I was at how adamant. Drew was about not moving forward and making these changes. But was he? Scared of anything or afraid. No, he's not that close to Drew, either. He agrees that we would be better off without either one of them. He outright said in our call that we won't need Drew. That. Do just fine without him, so I don't think the notice is concerned about that.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:11:09.233Z)

Okay? All right. That's. I guess that's the main thing I wanted to know because I. I felt a lot of trepidation from him last Thursday, and I was just worried about that, like, that I was putting him, or something I had done was putting him at risk or something like that, which I would never. Want to do, okay? Well, you have listened to me. For? Way long enough today. Thank you. Tomorrow with Stacy and Aldoni. She's at western alliance bank. She? So she's a lender. What I was attempting to do was try to find a lender that you could talk to about, like, the interface, like, almost like a customer interview or. I don't know what you. What you. There's a term you use right. When you describe it, but the Persona that's what that call is. It's like for you to get time with an actual lender in the hotel space to ask the questions, you know, to try to show her and get some excitement from her that, yes, we have a product that's right around the corner. That. Hey, we want to build this product with real user feedback. And she's the user, or she's the user herself.

### You (2025-11-18T16:12:17.877Z)

Yeah. All right.

### Guest (2025-11-18T16:12:21.073Z)

All right. All right, Howard. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
