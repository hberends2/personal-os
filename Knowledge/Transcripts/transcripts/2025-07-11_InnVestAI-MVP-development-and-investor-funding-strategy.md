kinda concerned that they might have been ghosting you there for a while, but you hadn't heard back from them. Yeah, that's that's great news.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:01:57.799Z)

Yeah. That is that is.

### You (2025-07-11T16:01:58.413Z)

Yeah. That is. That is. Cool. The only thing is I

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:01.709Z)

The only thing is I've I'm supposed to go there four days. So

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:02.833Z)

I'm supposed to go there four days. So Oh. Four days to office. But but they're they're in Philly, aren't they, or near you at least?

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:06.899Z)

four days to office. Yeah. Forty five minutes.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:10.663Z)

Yeah. Forty five minutes. Oh, yeah. Okay. I mean, it's not great, but it's not Columbus. Yeah. It's not Columbus. That's the only great thing.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:15.449Z)

Yeah. It's not That's the only great thing. And the other great thing is it is all data in

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:20.033Z)

Yeah. And the other great thing is it is all data and AI. Cool. Cool. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:25.329Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:25.733Z)

Well, we had a good call yesterday, and I know that you had some connection issues. And

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:30.929Z)

No. I was in the office.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:31.073Z)

had to drop. No. I was in the office. So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:35.389Z)

So

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:36.443Z)

I came off for few, like, fifteen minutes, but then I have to go in.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:37.379Z)

I came out for a few, like, ten, fifteen minutes, but then I had to go in.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:40.153Z)

I was listening,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:41.059Z)

I was listening,

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:41.203Z)

but I can talk.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:42.219Z)

but I couldn't talk.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:42.233Z)

Yeah. Yeah. But I noticed that you you you dropped before the end of the call. I think you probably had to go any anyway, we we went for quite a while. And Mhmm. I I will send you

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:54.129Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:55.733Z)

my notes from my Granola meeting.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:02:57.829Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:02:59.643Z)

Yeah. But the bottom line is after you dropped Yeah. I was I was you could probably tell I was really

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:03:06.539Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:03:09.973Z)

still kinda struggling to get Mark and everybody to realize that, you know, you dude, you can't have everything in the MVP. And going on. So I ended up, you know, trying to explain to him about

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:03:20.319Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:03:21.893Z)

agile and let him letting him know that even though we release a feature or release a product that doesn't have everything that we want, we're still working in the background. So while we've got you know, five or 10 beta testers working on the MVP, you and I would still be working on the other things that he wants in there. And I I think he finally started to get it. But the good news is I I did convince them or or at least they are fully aware now that we have gone about as far as we can possibly go. Without you getting the database and subscription and everything. And I also brought up know, the fact that I didn't know what your bandwidth was. And that, you know, they all know that you are, you know, working part time and everything. And so I said, you know, I I can't commit to a timeline until we get on the call. With Vinod. And I said, but remember Vinod did have

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:04:30.369Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:04:32.383Z)

somebody he knows in India and had included some money for a helper. And so Drew Drew kinda jumped in at that point and, like, he he just made this he said, okay. I'm I'm willing to invest some money and and Mark. Maybe you could help. And and Mark agreed that the two of them are finally willing to put in, which which to me was a great sign that they have bought into it. Right? So I I kinda think both of them might have been a little bit cautious at first to see how viable this might be. But the fact that they're both willing to write a check to to at least get us off the ground with a database and and even hopefully bring in, you know, the junior developer who it is you're thinking of, so that we can get this thing going. Yeah. That's that's

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:28.579Z)

Yeah. That's that's a great new because that's

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:30.643Z)

idea. Because that's definitely what we need. Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:33.379Z)

definitely what we need.

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:35.223Z)

that's awesome. And then I will also

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:35.709Z)

So yeah. That's awesome. And then I was also thinking of

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:38.723Z)

thinking of providing a clear

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:41.149Z)

writing a clear email that, you know, we have already developed POC. Now.

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:45.953Z)

the next time get paid,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:47.509Z)

Next MVP so

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:47.533Z)

So for I'm gonna say MVP doesn't have to be just for testing. And we think

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:50.239Z)

mean, see, MVP doesn't have to be for testing.

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:53.273Z)

should

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:53.409Z)

MVP

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:54.423Z)

be, like,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:54.989Z)

should be, like, testing

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:55.413Z)

10 you

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:05:57.709Z)

you because you've already developed POC. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:05:59.313Z)

POC.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:02.169Z)

Mark through and, like, leapforth and

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:04.453Z)

And to to report back, we can do we can have more people for sure.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:05.939Z)

do we four, five people can do on we can have more people for sure.

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:08.993Z)

If they are available to make all the time that we should be in the

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:10.519Z)

They are available. The main goal of MVP is

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:13.273Z)

on some client

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:13.539Z)

be either onboard some client or onboard some investors.

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:18.043Z)

it. Yep. Yep. They're gonna be delivered to the

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:18.069Z)

That should be the end of it. Like, you know, we deliver you the MVP, now just, you know, sell it. Get either investors or get the client before, you know, we put in more

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:26.793Z)

know, work. Because even the we we definitely it's gonna take more time.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:30.179Z)

and more work. Even the MVP element is gonna take a lot of time.

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:33.403Z)

Yeah. You know, I have to double the infrastructure and we

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:34.819Z)

We'll have to develop the infrastructure, then we'll have to develop the

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:36.233Z)

have to double the thing.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:38.679Z)

application, then we'll you know,

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:40.323Z)

I think that would be great if you could do that, if you could send an email because I

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:40.689Z)

have a kind of

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:44.513Z)

I I did set the stage for

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:45.869Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:46.983Z)

the time that it's gonna take because I explained to him the the tool that I'm using.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:06:52.189Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:06:53.843Z)

Is not something that we can use, but you can take what I've built and and replicate it But

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:00.719Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:01.123Z)

it's gonna take time to get that to the the the level where we can release it to external And then I reinforce the fact that that's we can't even start on that. You know, until we get everything in place. So why don't you do that? Why don't you go ahead and and mean, let's make the let's make a call. Let's let's decide what tools you want. Whether it's AWS, Azure. I mean, I I don't care.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:29.019Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:29.083Z)

Yeah. But but let's let's go ahead and make a call and see if we can get on Sure. Yeah. And then and then and then let's you know, if you've got somebody in mind that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:36.049Z)

Sure. Yeah. And

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:40.493Z)

that can help us out, let's go ahead and start bringing somebody on board. In fact, Drew even made the argument for maybe more than one. So Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:50.299Z)

Oh, okay. That would be great. Then we can really knock out

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:53.663Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:55.469Z)

things real fast. The

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:55.943Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:07:58.039Z)

thing is I clearly wanted to differentiate that this is what is developed

### You (2025-07-11T16:07:59.333Z)

That this is what is the POC.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:02.169Z)

on p o POC. What is missing? POC is super useful.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:03.053Z)

POC is super useful. Yeah. One I use that just

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:06.239Z)

We're gonna use that

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:07.363Z)

for

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:07.869Z)

just go to

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:09.323Z)

and it does take 10 or that, you know, we can take

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:10.059Z)

tool for anything, any logic, any code that, you know, we can take.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:12.553Z)

Yeah. But

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:14.059Z)

Right? It's not that we cannot take.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:14.883Z)

And on the written report.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:16.429Z)

Anything from we can take a lot of quote from there.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:16.493Z)

Content. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:18.739Z)

So that's super useful, and that is our first step. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:20.933Z)

Our first step. Right? Yeah. Now I just wanna make the clear that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:24.239Z)

I just wanna make it clear that this POC covered this one. Now what is missing is per

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:24.623Z)

this POC covered this one. Now what is missing is persistence. What is missing is login. What is missing

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:29.119Z)

What is missing is login. What is missing is database. What is missing is new user onboard.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:29.873Z)

is database. What is missing is near user onboarding. Yes. So make develop and

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:34.089Z)

So we cannot develop that in the NBP part. And, you know, these people's

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:34.663Z)

in the MVP partner. And these people

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:39.059Z)

Diane, Mark, I don't know whether Drew will be part of that. Should promise that, yeah, after this, we should

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:46.433Z)

go out to the investors or to the clients. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:47.049Z)

be able to go out to the investors or to the clients.

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:50.333Z)

And, you know, set it Otherwise, there's no point

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:51.879Z)

You know, sell it. Otherwise, there's no point putting in so much work

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:53.993Z)

putting so much work and effort. Mean, if we have just Yeah. Keep on

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:56.849Z)

effort. I mean, if we are just

### You (2025-07-11T16:08:58.573Z)

And also that we have

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:08:59.549Z)

keep on

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:00.393Z)

this is

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:00.449Z)

and then also that, you know, this is exactly what you're gonna do in

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:00.703Z)

exactly what we're do with. We can generate a payment.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:04.259Z)

getting the MVP.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:04.463Z)

If there's anything else or anything, you know, you

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:06.069Z)

There's anything else or anything, you know, you

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:07.413Z)

do not bother you. Want.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:09.119Z)

do not want or you want,

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:09.373Z)

Let's discuss that and then this

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:11.149Z)

let's discuss that and then let's

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:11.413Z)

let's discuss the timeline.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:13.089Z)

let's discuss the timeline.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:13.163Z)

Yeah. There there are a couple of things, but I don't think that they're difficult.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:18.369Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:18.913Z)

You know, one of them one of them is a risk matrix. And and there's a couple other things. So let me go through my notes. I'll highlight the the most high priority items, but again, I I

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:34.439Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:36.323Z)

brought up the whole skateboard to the old school. Analogy. Right? Told them, you know, the POC is the skateboard. And you know, that that this is where we are.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:46.959Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:49.643Z)

Know? And and I probably had to bring it up two or three times to Marcus. I know we don't

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:09:54.059Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:09:54.313Z)

have to have everything ready. On day one. That you know? And and, you know, we have to consider you know, since we're such a small shop, we don't have to two official two week sprints. Right? Yeah. I mean, you could build something today and release it tomorrow. And and so that's that's what I tried to explain to him is

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:10.999Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well,

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:13.983Z)

that we're not having to wait for a while. Okay. I mean, these features out the door.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:20.349Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:22.063Z)

So Thank you.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:22.969Z)

Yep. Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:23.123Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:25.619Z)

Yep. Yep. So

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:26.223Z)

That sounds

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:27.179Z)

that that sounds good to me. I will write production level

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:30.013Z)

this way. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:31.309Z)

this version. Right? Earlier, just writing some random code.

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:34.023Z)

This way. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:36.239Z)

But now this has to be

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:36.633Z)

Production level course so that I can onboard the user

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:38.399Z)

level code so that we can onboard the user. We can deploy to different

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:39.653Z)

and deploy it with different Yeah. Environment. And then going

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:42.619Z)

environments. And then going forward, we'll

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:42.643Z)

forward with continue same. Goal. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:10:45.409Z)

with the same code.

### You (2025-07-11T16:10:46.323Z)

So the other thing that I found very encouraging is that Drew didn't come right out directly and say it, but he did come up with a couple of examples when we were talking about data processing.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:02.199Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:03.553Z)

Yeah. We also have to have the ability to extract historical data And and even and if they're not HPIS clients, Drew did say something about, well,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:14.289Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:16.473Z)

know, we can we can have an a data upload and then process it through HBIS. And then send it back. So I think he I think he's kind of understands now that for non HBIS clients, we still need his data extraction so that we don't have to go and and basically duplicate what he already has. So that was good news as well.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:42.459Z)

Yeah. And that

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:43.173Z)

Yeah. Okay. That's what was not clear to me. Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:46.739Z)

what was not clear to me. He was saying that he'll provide the API endpoint.

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:47.323Z)

Saying that you're providing. VPN. Point. I'm not sure whether you're gonna provide the API

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:52.089Z)

I was not sure whether he's gonna provide the API endpoint.

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:52.773Z)

API end points to provide historical data or to process the files so that we can take the files

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:55.109Z)

To provide the historical data or to process the files so that we can take the files

### You (2025-07-11T16:11:58.353Z)

our platform to his

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:11:59.839Z)

from our platform to his.

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:01.263Z)

Yeah. I mean, we're gonna need both, obviously. We we need to send the data to him, but after processing, we need to get that data back into the InnVestAI master database.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:12.019Z)

Yeah. The only concern I have is

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:12.133Z)

The client only done some I have

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:16.939Z)

how long they're gonna take.

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:18.113Z)

file.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:18.409Z)

So user uploads the file now,

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:18.513Z)

Now. When can the user expects the report. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:21.079Z)

When can user expects the report? Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:22.473Z)

Yeah. If that takes too long.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:24.269Z)

If that takes

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:24.803Z)

It has to happen within

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:25.939Z)

too long, it has to happen within

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:27.013Z)

like, statements. Right? Yeah. Because it is a

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:29.009Z)

like, second or milliseconds. Right? We have

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:32.293Z)

cannot be there on hold. But I have to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:33.459Z)

user cannot be there on board forever.

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:34.483Z)

Yeah. That that's a Oh, yes. I haven't seen a demo of his tool, have you? No. I No. I have not. K. Maybe we maybe you and I should set some time up

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:43.319Z)

No. I have not. I have not.

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:46.373Z)

with Drew. And just the three of us talk through this. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:51.729Z)

Yeah. Again, the

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:52.483Z)

I I think the data is supposed to going to provide

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:55.679Z)

other thing is the data he's going to provide

### You (2025-07-11T16:12:56.993Z)

is that gonna reside in our database.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:12:58.829Z)

is that gonna reside in our database?

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:01.163Z)

And rate them? Ownership of that data.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:13:02.899Z)

We're gonna have the ownership of that data or not?

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:04.713Z)

And Yeah. I think that's that's

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:13:06.829Z)

The

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:07.143Z)

that's not an option. I think it has to be our database. Now even if he's got an HPIS client, I that becomes ours. I think we still need to get at least that client data into InnVest. So InnVest has to be separate from HPIS unless unless he and Diane are working on a merger.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:13:16.259Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:32.063Z)

Right? So if if we become one entity, then it's not a problem. But if we are going to be two separate legal entities, we do have to get that data.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:13:43.159Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:43.293Z)

Over here. And I mean, I'm I'm I'm sure somehow

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:13:48.869Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:13:50.253Z)

in our user agreement, I'm sure we have to say something about you know, the the back end processing is done by a third party, but all of the data resides in the InnVest database. So I mean, I think it it would be in his best interest to do that as well. So but I think that's something you and I and Drew should just have a little side meeting. So what's your schedule now that you're gonna be with morning then? Same

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:17.799Z)

Same.

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:20.763Z)

speed. Morning. At 08:30.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:22.409Z)

Each morning at 08:30.

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:24.563Z)

Comma, one to five. Okay. Then

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:26.629Z)

Comma, modify.

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:27.383Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:28.009Z)

But then

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:28.603Z)

So you're gonna you're gonna be limited in

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:29.429Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:30.913Z)

your meeting availability unless you wanna meat. Early evenings.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:39.329Z)

Yeah. I it's when when do we have meetings? On Monday and Friday?

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:40.073Z)

Monday and Friday. Monday does not work well for Mark. So she's been setting them up on Tuesdays. So we actually did send up two meetings next week. So next Thursday at or next Tuesday at five. Okay. And then Thursday, at

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:14:58.199Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:14:59.123Z)

three. And Dude, stay on phone.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:02.439Z)

Tuesday, five.

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:02.983Z)

Fine. I would probably be driving home or

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:05.459Z)

Five should be fine. I would probably be driving home or

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:06.503Z)

Yeah. I'll be home But yesterday is a bit early for sure. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:09.349Z)

I'll be home. But, yeah, three is a bit early for sure.

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:11.573Z)

Yeah. So I requested two meetings next week so that we could quickly go over some of the stuff that I the the idea list in Jira so that we can start working as a team to go

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:26.589Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:27.153Z)

item by item to prioritize.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:30.789Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:31.023Z)

Don't think we're gonna get that done in an hour. I mean, I've been through this exercise before, and you end up going down rabbit holes, and people start going on things. So actually, what I'm what I'm thinking of is you you're familiar with the the the Jira idea. That I'm talking about, the Jira discovery. Right. So yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:49.409Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:15:51.953Z)

there are three columns or three areas that we need to score The first two will actually be primarily

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:15:56.879Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:01.513Z)

Diane, Mark, and Drew in terms of impact and and that. But the third column for effort, that's that's you. I mean, you don't have to be on the call. You could just do it on your own time.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:12.649Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:13.373Z)

After after we go through and do the first two, and then you decide, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:17.619Z)

I'm gonna

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:17.653Z)

how how hard is it gonna be.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:18.639Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:18.973Z)

And then that's it. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:19.679Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:21.483Z)

Well, you can definitely put it on the board. I don't think

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:24.079Z)

We can definitely put it on the board, Howard. They

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:24.903Z)

Then, yes, let's click on the word feature we want in that meeting and then we can pull it

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:27.409Z)

is, let's be clear than what features we want in the MVP, and then we can put it on the

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:30.513Z)

the board and just go around everything. And

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:33.159Z)

board and score and everything.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:34.523Z)

I think that's it for that's

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:35.449Z)

And

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:36.183Z)

close

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:37.239Z)

think you have to let's

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:37.553Z)

one, like what are we developing in that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:38.739Z)

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:44.049Z)

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:45.313Z)

would be that probably this better over the

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:46.029Z)

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:48.373Z)

better over the email.

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:49.933Z)

On the board. Once, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:51.019Z)

And then we can move it on the board. Once, you know, we say, yeah, these are the top items we should be

### You (2025-07-11T16:16:57.423Z)

Yeah. So the board is, like,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:16:58.589Z)

putting in MVP.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:00.743Z)

just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Right? So Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:04.919Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:05.453Z)

There's even things like on there. I added, like, a mobile version international version, things that we know not gonna do for a long time. But I wanted just to make sure that we've got a space

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:16.869Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:16.893Z)

where single idea we can add in there. So so some of that stuff will just yeah. We don't have to even talk about,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:20.839Z)

Yeah. That's fine.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:24.333Z)

mobile and international. We'll focus on that. But the board does include, like, a now, next, later type of of of prioritization. So that's where we talk about, you know, here's here's the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:40.219Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:40.683Z)

Yeah. Here's the things that we'll do.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:40.809Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:43.223Z)

Later. So then now it would be the POC, the next would be the MVP. And then we can put you know, I think probably two thirds of everything that's on that board will be later. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:17:57.629Z)

Sounds good. That's good.

### You (2025-07-11T16:17:59.273Z)

### You (2025-07-11T16:18:35.623Z)

I will say

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:18:36.559Z)

LLC.

### You (2025-07-11T16:18:36.993Z)

Oh. Not finalized. I she still says she needs

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:18:40.009Z)

Is it?

### You (2025-07-11T16:18:42.963Z)

to get information to us for personal data. I I haven't seen anything yet. So I don't know I know she is I I'm an pretty sure that she's working with an attorney, so maybe she's waiting on something from me, and I I don't know. I can I can ping her and find out?

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:00.999Z)

Gotcha. Gotcha.

### You (2025-07-11T16:19:01.383Z)

Gotcha. Alright. So I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:05.189Z)

Alright. Alright. So I'll I'll drop that email, and we can go from there.

### You (2025-07-11T16:19:05.843Z)

Okay. Alright. And then I'll find to, like, the funding

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:09.409Z)

And then as far as

### You (2025-07-11T16:19:09.863Z)

was more of this thing. Don't know.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:12.169Z)

like, the funding goes, what are they saying? Are we gonna open the account? Because I would require a card on either AWS, Azure. They all

### You (2025-07-11T16:19:16.643Z)

Need a there. Yeah. Yeah. We talked we talked about that as well.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:20.119Z)

need a card there for sure.

### You (2025-07-11T16:19:21.703Z)

Drew has something set up, so I think he's kind of helping Diane in that area. Because we we did talk about how how are we going to pay for this. We would have to have an account set up. I don't know I I kind of heard a comment that we may be able to do it right away without having to have the LLC But yeah, mean, we can't put that on our personal cards. So we gotta we gotta have something corporate that we can do. That's good.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:19:58.949Z)

Sounds good.

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:00.223Z)

And it's correct the features go right from what

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:03.739Z)

As far as the features go, right, perform a what you developed as

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:03.813Z)

you developed as POC. Right? That's the first thing. Obviously, we got

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:08.229Z)

POC. Right? That's

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:08.453Z)

to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:09.949Z)

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:14.919Z)

like, log login page.

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:15.433Z)

Still here. Yeah. To for what I need. Client,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:18.369Z)

So if we have to onboard any new client,

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:19.123Z)

I think we have to Yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:22.819Z)

I think we'll have to

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:24.583Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:24.799Z)

create a user management for sure. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:25.023Z)

We not think through that.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:27.059Z)

And we'll have to think through that.

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:27.533Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:30.809Z)

What roles

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:31.263Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:33.829Z)

you know, how it it would be probably a company

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:35.693Z)

Then, yeah, there will be different

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:38.879Z)

And then, you know, there will be different

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:40.663Z)

Yeah. That's that's what we have to figure about. I mean, do we need an admin? I mean, what is

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:41.119Z)

managers, say admin or all those type of roles. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:45.273Z)

there to administer? I mean, are we I I think probably down the road, we'll probably have some

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:52.359Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:53.623Z)

add ons So maybe we do need to have somebody that's got that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:56.639Z)

Mhmm. So

### You (2025-07-11T16:20:57.713Z)

role

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:20:59.959Z)

okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:00.733Z)

I'm I don't think they want to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:01.099Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:02.943Z)

can just probably have functionality to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:04.609Z)

For MB, we were done. If we can just probably have functionality to

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:06.603Z)

onboard. New user with probably admin role.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:10.109Z)

onboard a new user with probably admin role.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:12.863Z)

Continue. You know.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:14.109Z)

To start with.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:14.113Z)

I

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:15.219Z)

And then we can

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:15.773Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:16.319Z)

continue, you know,

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:16.353Z)

The only thing I can think of out of the gate

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:17.989Z)

adding more users. Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:19.763Z)

that we need right from day one is opting in to data sharing. And I think we'll do what we did at Rede that by default they opt in. And if they By default, they don't wanna opt in, then they'll have to log in and check the box and do that. That's the only administrative role I can

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:38.439Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:41.403Z)

think of. Unless we also wanna let them which we should do. User setup. Yeah. And there was some times I'm 30 under the phone.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:55.049Z)

And there were some terms and condition, and there's another form

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:55.133Z)

They used to sign what they call. Then, like you. That was good.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:21:59.089Z)

used to sign. What was it called? In Red IQ.

### You (2025-07-11T16:21:59.623Z)

FedEx. Mhmm. There's some form that they would sign or check

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:02.179Z)

That was even in Red X.

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:03.773Z)

the

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:04.149Z)

There's some form that they would sign or check the box

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:04.223Z)

box. Like, they accept some certain conditions or something like that. Yeah. There there are the the terms of service

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:10.399Z)

that they accept terms and conditions or something like that.

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:12.693Z)

which is Yeah. Separate from yeah. The terms of service is actually where the data opt in and opt

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:13.649Z)

While yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:17.603Z)

out. Was. So yeah, Which is which is another good point. We've got some paperwork issues that we need to resolve before we can start getting external clients, at least paying clients. Yeah. But on the user side also, let's also keep in mind that we could potentially be facing the

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:35.319Z)

Yeah. So

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:37.023Z)

same issues that we had at Berends. Berends. Where we need to have a user that might be assigned

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:44.219Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:44.333Z)

to different accounts. You know, CVRE is just like Arcadia, where each office is independent. But they might share some personnel. So we need to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:22:51.509Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:22:54.173Z)

keep that in mind. Whatever we can do to simplify that. And I think did you see my email about whether or not we should accept private emails, noncompany, and and Drew's response about how their company uses Microsoft. Microsoft authentication. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:23:24.709Z)

Microsoft forward authentication.

### You (2025-07-11T16:23:25.863Z)

Single sign on to the Microsoft account, and he said out of five years, he thinks he's only had one client. That didn't use Microsoft. So, so I guess it's okay. I and and because because we had

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:23:39.809Z)

Yeah. I'm in.

### You (2025-07-11T16:23:41.463Z)

so many issues at Red IQ. With people with their email addresses and everything else. And sharing addresses. I I I know for a fact that there was a

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:23:48.369Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:23:52.493Z)

lot of people out there sharing their credentials. And we got we have to lock that down from day one. So Oh, we can't set set say that sign. No. I Nothing that's even right

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:05.499Z)

Oh, we should just have single sign on functionality.

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:07.983Z)

That's not Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we we wanna make sure it's a work domain.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:10.469Z)

Nothing with Gmail. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:11.463Z)

And not Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or anything like that. So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:12.069Z)

What Yes. Thanks. Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:16.263Z)

Yeah. Another thing we'll need with the authentication side.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:17.059Z)

Yeah. Check.

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:19.633Z)

Yeah. And then I just haven't

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:21.969Z)

Yeah. And then as far as our

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:22.883Z)

invest AI dot com email at code. You can And

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:26.939Z)

investai.com email and all the at code, we can anytime increase the user. Right? If we have to onboard our

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:30.863Z)

works. Okay. So, yeah, we we are finding we can buy from all users. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Each each additional user is

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:34.139Z)

developers. Okay. So, yeah, if we if we have funding, can buy from more users. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:24:38.183Z)

I think what was it? A 100 a 100 and something a year. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't very expensive, but you know, one thing we don't have is we don't have an info at InnVest or sales at InnVest. We're we're gonna need a few generic emails like that. But but, yeah, I mean, they'll all have the InnVestAI domain. That's that's not a problem.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:24:58.189Z)

Yeah. Makes sense.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:02.373Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:05.069Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:08.213Z)

Alright. Cool. But, yeah, overall, I I think it was a good call. Nice. I was thanks there.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:14.879Z)

Nice. I wish I was there.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:15.433Z)

Yeah. You know, I think after you might have been a about the time that you dropped off when I was trying to educate Mark on that. And I basically just told him, I said, look. If

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:25.749Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:27.323Z)

if if you want all of these features to be included in the MVP, We're not gonna get anything out the door until 2026. And and Drew kinda backed that up. So I think Mark realizes that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:39.009Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:43.753Z)

that that we can't get everything in on the MB And

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:48.519Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:48.543Z)

yeah, so I think we're good. I think that was a good call. One the better ones we've had. Makes sense. Makes sense. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:25:56.669Z)

Makes sense. Makes sense.

### You (2025-07-11T16:25:58.163Z)

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:18.593Z)

So far as video So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:23.109Z)

That'll be great. And then as far as new

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:24.093Z)

So you said we are good to go.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:26.369Z)

developer onboarding, right,

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:27.543Z)

No. No.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:28.319Z)

So you said

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:28.893Z)

We have

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:29.779Z)

we are good to go or

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:30.333Z)

we have an agreement with Mark Drew that Okay. We need to include that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:37.399Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:38.283Z)

right from day one. That we we Right. Get somebody in there to help you

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:41.959Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:42.503Z)

with the coating. They're still discussing how much Now they did mention, like, 10,000 each. So that would give us 20,000.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:26:54.289Z)

Mhmm. Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:26:55.243Z)

In the bank to work with. Which I think is sufficient. And then once we get the MVP out, then we can start getting some additional funds from outside investors.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:02.719Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:06.353Z)

So so, yeah, I think it it all depends on I I told them that I would speak to you, that we had this call today, and that you know, we now need to start on a on a timeline. Of when do we think we could have MVP. Ready Right? So is it gonna be thirty days? Is it gonna be ninety days?

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:28.129Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:30.943Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:31.389Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:31.403Z)

What's it gonna take? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:32.839Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:33.633Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:35.989Z)

Yep. Yep. And then timeline will vary depending on

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:39.603Z)

That's the thing. I'm I'm gonna go through the list. I was I was

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:40.959Z)

feature we are developing and the developers we have. Right?

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:42.593Z)

I was a little upset last week when I heard that Drew, Diane, and Mark had a meeting and put together the road map. Like, wait a minute, guys. This this is kinda backwards. So I have to take what they put together

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:56.599Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:27:56.723Z)

basically determine what's realistic. Right? So let me do that

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:27:58.129Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:28:00.873Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-07-11T16:28:05.743Z)

go over it and then you know, basically, you and I need to sign off on what they put together. And Okay. We'll determine what we can

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:28:13.469Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-11T16:28:14.603Z)

cannot get into the MVP we'll decide the priority on these. Mark, I'm sure, will push back and no. No. We need this, this, and this too. But we'll see. Yeah, that way, then we can put together a a better estimate of of the time involved And then, of course, you can then justify one or more developers saying if we have you know, two developers you know, we can get it in this amount of time. And it will let them decide. So try. Sounds good. Alright. Cool. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:28:51.259Z)

for

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:27.173Z)

I don't know. For so many years. And I think it's

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:28.279Z)

and then these guys have data, like, I know,

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:30.033Z)

's terabytes. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:32.009Z)

for so many years, and it is in

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:32.163Z)

10 terabytes. Yeah. Yeah. There were

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:35.039Z)

terabytes. Like,

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:35.763Z)

They're a big company. They're and they're not just multifamily.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:36.439Z)

10 terabytes. Okay. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:40.903Z)

They've they've got plenty of them. So, yeah, you're gonna have fun with that. Yeah. Alright. So Just don't change your mind and decide to

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:50.029Z)

Alright. So right now, the challenge

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:50.463Z)

work for them full time and leave InnVest. No.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:29:57.219Z)

No. I'm definitely not. Yeah. My

### You (2025-07-11T16:29:59.693Z)

Getting there. Right? I'll just

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:00.629Z)

actually thinking that whatever exposure data exposure I'm getting there, right, I'll just

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:01.273Z)

come up with you the same thing here with that phone. Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:05.549Z)

replicate the same thing here because that's all we need. So

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:06.743Z)

that that's how I think about it. Yeah. The three that you

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:09.729Z)

So

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:10.333Z)

a good act. Exposure. As far as

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:11.379Z)

that's that's how I'm thinking. Like, it's it's really a good exposure as far as

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:12.063Z)

data and AI grows. Yeah. They're mostly using So probably I'm thinking whether

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:16.079Z)

data and AI goes. They're mostly using Azure, so probably I'm thinking whether

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:18.373Z)

just stick to Azure. So that You know, that makes sense with everybody being Microsoft and

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:22.359Z)

to just stick to Azure so that

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:24.223Z)

I I don't know. I don't I don't I don't have an

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:25.309Z)

it's kind yeah.

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:27.543Z)

opinion one way or the other. I don't know enough about the strengths and weaknesses of each. So Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-11T16:30:33.149Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-11T16:30:34.093Z)
