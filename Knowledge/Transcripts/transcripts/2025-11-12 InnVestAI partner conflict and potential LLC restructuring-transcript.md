# Transcript for: InnVestAI partner conflict and potential LLC restructuring

### You (2025-11-12T16:22:56.402Z)

Now with my responses. He is definitely drawing a line in the sand. He is not willing to sign the LLC its current state and then agree to renegotiate. He wants everything taken care of. With the LLC before any funds are deposited.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:23:20.177Z)

Yeah, but I think you have already outlined everything, like how we can move forward, so.

### You (2025-11-12T16:23:25.202Z)

Yeah. But we are using this. Not willing to do that.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:23:31.777Z)

What are the remaining items now after this?

### You (2025-11-12T16:23:35.762Z)

Well, this is.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:23:36.097Z)

After what?

### You (2025-11-12T16:23:38.242Z)

The only points that he had on his email. And he suggested that we set up a long hog. It's a block off three hours. And. That's just hash all these issues out and get it done once and for all, which I don't disagree with that. But. I don't know what. We will get it hashed out. The. Fact that he. Is requesting that. We first put together a job descriptions, then agree on them. And all this other stuff. I don't think even a three hour call would be sufficient. I think there's got to be work done outside. And then. Diane said that. She. Also, we've got a pretty extensive chat thread going on. Teams. I think she's at. Point.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:24:39.857Z)

Teams. Okay? I. I don't think I'm on those chats. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:24:44.162Z)

One between day and I.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:24:45.777Z)

Okay, good.

### You (2025-11-12T16:24:48.722Z)

Like I said in my text. I don't think we're going to fix this. I think. Diane does not want to deal with market anymore, period. And. When I have that call with Mark. He? Blamed everything. On, diane. And then kicks up responsibility. I push back on a lot of things. He was making claims that were simply not true. Things that he was saying that we never, ever discussed. Her consulting in exchange for the $75,000 which she brought up. Many times on our weekly calls.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:25:27.217Z)

Yes, she did. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:25:29.122Z)

And just different things. That was just one example.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:25:33.137Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-12T16:25:36.082Z)

He just say anything about June, yourself or me? Everything was stunning. And seeing this thing and did that. This is falling apart. Diane can't do this. It's not her company anymore. Partners. And I just kept going back and forth. So I. Don't know. I just really don't think that it's going to be. Resolved.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:26:07.857Z)

This is crazy.

### You (2025-11-12T16:26:10.162Z)

One of the things that we discussed.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:26:12.897Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:26:13.522Z)

In the spread between Diane and I would be just to rip up. The llc. Start. Over again. With the four of. Us.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:26:27.057Z)

I don't know whether Drew would be coming in if Mark is out.

### You (2025-11-12T16:26:32.402Z)

I don't know. Diane made the same comment, but she thinks. We would just walk away. From it. And come seashore. He kind of said the same thing. He was like, always comes to me. We talk about these things. I don't think he do some of my go so I don't know that Drew. Would walk away. From everything that we've done. I think he would. Be. I don't know. I don't know if his loyalties lie directly with Marc or. He's just kind of. Caught in the middle.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:27:27.617Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:27:28.162Z)

But anyway. I don't think it's going to be as easy as it sounds. I think.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:27:32.497Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:27:34.402Z)

Would absolutely fight back. I. Did make some recommendations. Like, let's offer him. A feel like we would offer an employee, give him a commission, pace. So here, 5% equity like we would with any other key employee.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:27:52.497Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-12T16:27:52.802Z)

He would do that. I thought he wouldn't do.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:27:54.977Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:27:55.602Z)

That.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:27:56.897Z)

But tell me one thing. Diam was very concerned about him. Like Mark bad thing InnVestAI and you know, we having a big tent because he's against us. So isn't she concerned now? Because I. I am concerned for that now because see, I think Zero is right.

### You (2025-11-12T16:28:17.122Z)

Yes. And no. In one individual's lie. Is she and I have had. Conversations with her friends and mentors. And all of them. Were extremely excited. We gather the product. We show them? We just discuss what's going on. And where we are now. The person was kind of young, and I don't think. Would be the replacement for. Mark, but there's two people last night. Who? Both. Of them. Probably have lower contacts and experience in Marco. S. One person. Actually started working on. Some. Hotel. Database. And the information stuff back in the 90s. It was probably early 70s. And he built. The entire team at CBI for their real estate analytics. And. Basically. Put together. Deep enough. Sorted into co star. And. That product. Was solid by CBI earlier this year, I think. I don't know if you remember what email that I had sent, but. There's a lot of good talents on the market now that they put millions into this product and then decided not to use it. But here's the person. That built it and known the people that we spoke with last week. One was kind of the lead. They designed us their engineer on the team. And they both basically almost upper right ass like. Can we depart with you? So, yeah, there's absolutely a danger that markets. There's ways of circumventing that, I think. Larc probably. One of the things we can do is offer. Like a 5%. Non equ. Ity or non voting? Non funder. Just a 5% equity position in the company. For the. Work he's done up to this point. And I don't know. What you have to sign through Agnex, if anything. But I am deciding basically the MBA that basically said I can't diagnostic company. Which I'm cool with that. I'm not the type of person who's going to go around and say negative things. But we can do the same thing. You could just say it's part of this package. We would have to pay them back, but it's invested. He'll push some more, we can come up with something. But yeah. And I kind of feel caught in there because he probably said my responses on his emails like, yeah, I'm the one. I agree with this. But now we have to get the bank account set up. For timing issue. It's not that I disagree with everything.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:31:36.337Z)

Yeah. All right. All right. And timing issue is caused by these two guys, Diane and Drew, because they have been sitting on that LLC forever.

### You (2025-11-12T16:31:46.962Z)

We can see that. I mean, he mentioned that as well, that Diane keeps putting it off. She doesn't have the time, goes back. I didn't mention to him my conversation with her on Tuesday where I kind of. Codifying for her and that she agrees. That she was trying to write an all encompassing. Crystal ball in the future, but potential conflicts of our lives. And that we can't do that, and hopefully we can get this thing moved forward. But. I don't know. We're seeing what Diane is writing to me and what he's writing, and I just think that. I can't see them.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:32:32.817Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:32:32.882Z)

Work. It together.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:32:34.257Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's. I think let's let it flow for some time. Let's not make any decisions or, you know, let's not feel good or bad or anything. Let's flow it out and then we'll see.

### You (2025-11-12T16:32:49.042Z)

No. I agree.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:32:50.417Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:32:52.882Z)

I. Did not say anything. To Mark about her mortgage. That's me describing this. She's concerned about becoming. Delinquent on marriage and she needs some money. Now. That debate, which is the one first. I. Get it. If I was in her shoes. I'd be pushing for getting some money. Too.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:33:16.897Z)

How much. How much does she need? Like, does she need 8,000 something? Because I feel like I could help out something. A couple of thousand or something.

### You (2025-11-12T16:33:17.122Z)

But. Yeah. If it's just her mortgage, I'm sure it. I don't know. 2000, 3000? I have no idea. But, yeah, I can't imagine it would be the full 8,500. So I'm sure she's probably hoping to get some living expenses. On the markets, right?

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:33:41.377Z)

Right. Right. Yeah, I mean, just avoid this situation, right? I would personally help out with some thousand. Say 25 under something.

### You (2025-11-12T16:33:54.322Z)

Up here. In similar situations. I can't. Really lend any money. But one of the things I did mention when she talked about. Redoing everything. I mentioned that technically. The ip since there is no. InnVestAI. It's just an idea. And without on paper. That you and I actually own the ip. That we've done all of the development. On the model.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:34:28.497Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:34:30.482Z)

So that. We could. Start over again. With a different group of people. And whether it's just the three of us. Or whether Drew comes in as well. We could do that. There would be. Any. Argument. From anybody. About? Ownership of the IP or that we can't do this. But. Yeah. They could. Push back, but rule is the one that I don't want. To lose.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:35:02.497Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:35:04.642Z)

That he's not so strongly align. Ed with Marc the in Clockway as well.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:35:07.857Z)

I do think. I do think it's very strongly aligned with Mark. And he is frustrated. And Diane. Too. So I think Mark goes. The intro will go. I mean, that's. I. I feel like that's 80% chances.

### You (2025-11-12T16:35:27.042Z)

There. Probably. Well, maybe. We have to sweep. Apart from. Any. Of him. Key. Employee equity. Over an above. Founder, Equity? I don't know. I'm. Willing to do things like that if that's what it takes.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:35:45.057Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-12T16:35:45.842Z)

I. 'd rather give him some equity than a total stranger. Right. If we hire a salesperson and that salesperson doesn't perform.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:35:54.417Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:35:55.842Z)

That's a waste of time as well.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:35:57.457Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And this entire setup would go really well. If Mark Dial and True, these guys could just focus on sales and marketing. You're doing great on product. I was doing great on technology. That's all we need. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:36:15.602Z)

Yeah. And that's actually the point in his email that I probably agree strongest with is, yes, we've talked about this. Diana's talked about it. We got to get job descriptions. And go from there. So I think. We're all in agreement. On that. It. Might even help. But yeah. I don't know. I don't see InnVestAI Unravel. Ing. And. Just dying. But. There's going to have to be some very difficult. Decisions. Made.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:36:51.297Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, let's. Let's just wait and watch. Not take any distance or not decide anything. That's what I would do right now. Because. Let's hear everything and then figure out what is the best option. I'll try.

### You (2025-11-12T16:37:14.482Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:37:16.017Z)

Yeah. Yeah, Just. Just call me anytime, whenever you need to talk or people text me. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:37:22.162Z)

I'm just wondering if I should. Put something on the thread that you and. Drew and I are on. And. Kind of mention. The thing that's really. Blocking this whole issue. Is the fact that Diane needs money now.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:37:37.457Z)

We can. We can. We can probably.

### You (2025-11-12T16:37:38.002Z)

And maybe a dream would offer. It's like, okay, if that's all you need is to get a mortgage paid in bias another week or two.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:37:45.457Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:37:46.402Z)

We could. Probably work this out.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:37:48.737Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-11-12T16:37:50.242Z)

Why did I do that? It doesn't hurt. To bring it up. But I don't. Want lark on that. Thread or diane. So I'll keep it between the three of us.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:38:00.017Z)

If you me draw, we can do a quick call as well. Put 10, 15 hours if you want.

### You (2025-11-12T16:38:03.282Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:38:06.337Z)

Yeah, and if you want to put text, that's fine, too, but if you want to arrange a call, I'll hop on.

### You (2025-11-12T16:38:11.842Z)

Yeah. I will. Okay? And. He says.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:38:15.777Z)

All right. All right. Thank you.

### You (2025-11-12T16:38:16.962Z)

All right. We'll talk to you.

### Guest (2025-11-12T16:38:18.097Z)

All right. Bye. Bye.
