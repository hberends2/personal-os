### Guest (2025-08-05T21:31:03.746Z)

Goal or circular, I think. And then Granola be recommended. All right. Tuesday at 5:30. I have one small housekeeping thing to start with today, if that's all right. And I just want to coordinate our schedules for a follow up call with Jessica Kramer while we're all together. So she wanted us to block an hour for her so we could talk more about our platform. And she's available on the 8th, but it's at 5:00. Eastern. And then she's a bit. She's. I think she's west coast, and then she's available on the 12th. Any time. It looks like from 2 until 345 or until 4. What is next Tuesday? Look like for everyone.

### You (2025-08-05T21:31:57.594Z)

Back in Friday.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:31:58.146Z)

Wish you again. You would do Friday.

### You (2025-08-05T21:32:02.634Z)

No, I said Tuesday looks better than Friday.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:32:07.426Z)

Yeah. For being pride. It looks better because for you Fridays, But right. Okay? Is that all right with everyone else? Five o'clock on Friday. Just read it. This Friday. Yep. Yeah. Okay? And let me just really quickly. Yeah. Guys. I can't do Friday at 5. Unfortunately, I have a wedding this weekend. Okay? Let me go look at some of her other times. Give me a second. I could do Tuesday, but I just can't do Friday. Tuesday. She's only available until. I guess it's 4:30. Thursday the 14th. She's available at 5, if that would work. And on the 15th. She's available at 5 as well. If that would work. So next Thursday or Friday. Thursday would be good. I could do Thursday. Okay. And we usually have our call around this time anyway. Does that work for everyone else?

### You (2025-08-05T21:33:13.354Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:33:15.266Z)

Sorry. What time did they say then? So it's the 14th. August 14th, at 5:00. Eastern. Yeah. I'll try to show up. But if I cannot, you guys can continue. And what. What is. Who is she again? Yep. Let me show you who she is. Give me one second. To just get this done. Here. And jump back to teams. Share my screen. Hold on. Okay? So jessica. Is with this company called Techni. And, well, she does a lot of different things. This is jessica kramer. She was introduced to me by Carol Hensel. I think they're doing some sort of. Software. Development. For Carol's team on Dragonfly strategists. I just want to walk. Look at. She's with techie Infinity Ventures. And that is the Sashi's arm of technology. So the Soshi Group, you know, right there, a hotel ownership and management company that's very focused on technology. But she has. She was involved with the seven rooms. Sail to doordash. Which is pretty impressive. And then she has a ton of experience with. Here's your seven rooms experience. But Alice. Which obviously was sold then to Actival and then Travel Click, which, I mean, as she's got a deep, deep experience. With travelclick. So she does all different types of things. She helps people on her own. And she just doesn't want to be a founder anymore. Herself. So she helps people on her own. And then she also makes introduction introductions. To techni infinity ventures. This is techni infinity ventures. So they can make direct investments. They can have, like, an incubator program. But what I wanted to show you is the people, because. So this is Manish Gupta and Dipesh Gupta. They must be related. And I think Manish runs the hotel management company as well. This woman Angela is, she would be brought in. Jessica wants to do is spend an hour with us. And then make the introduction to Manish and to Unjolly. I'm sorry. Man. I'm terrible with pronunciation. Of names. But when you start to look through all the people that are in their network, it's pretty impressive. Where did I saw someone that was. Like kayak, blackstone, yum Berends

### You (2025-08-05T21:36:52.154Z)

Right there.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:36:53.746Z)

Expedia, google. So they're more on the revenue side. Of the house. But this investment opportunity would be of interest to them. Because. Because they're also investors. I don't think Justin call from Actables there too. Busy. Once a week. Just talked to him this morning. Okay? So he gets referred stuff. These people don't work for technique. I think they're people that help them source deals and things like that. They're part of their network. Gotcha. All right. And if nothing else comes of this, It looks like Jessica is just a good person to know in the industry. Because she knows a whole lot of people. And here's her picture. There on this list of advisors.

### You (2025-08-05T21:37:48.074Z)

Diane, if you scroll down a couple rows, I think the gentleman's name you were looking for was Eric. Down there. He was the last one on the right. A little bit more.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:38:00.146Z)

Oh, last one on the right.

### You (2025-08-05T21:38:00.314Z)

Couple more rows. I think you might have gone too far.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:38:08.146Z)

Someone named Taco van Heetsen.

### You (2025-08-05T21:38:12.874Z)

On the right. Go ahead. Eric? Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:38:14.226Z)

Eric zener.

### You (2025-08-05T21:38:14.874Z)

That's kayak Blackstone. Is that somebody you know, or is that just okay?

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:38:23.506Z)

No, I just. I mean, those. All of these companies seem very interesting. To me. So anyway, I mean, it could be that nothing comes of it. Other than we start to build a relationship with Jessica. It could be that she introduces us, then. To the principles of the Sashi Group and they are interested in our platform. And would want to. Invest with us some way. So that's how this all is kind of playing out. That's cool. Okay? I'll send you guys the invite once she confirms that it's one of those electronic scheduling systems. And then we will figure out our pitch, which I know is something else we're going to talk about today. All right. What do we go to next? The no. Do you want to give any updates or what's going on on your. Update and a quick demo as well. From my local computer. Though I did break something that I was working on, but I think we can still say something, so. When did we had last in Thursday, right? Since Thursday, we have been majorly focusing on our machine learning model. We have been kind of doing the fine tuning and training of that. Once that is done, that will be very useful to us. For the data extraction. As well as all the AI capabilities. On system. So this is Microsoft. I think I told you earlier. Israel Microsoft base model. It's going to be very useful. Over the long term, but, yeah, right now it's under process. But in the meantime, I did have something written for the data extraction. From the summary page, which is kind of short term thing. And we'll switch back to the machine learning model once it is completely active. I hope it should be done within a week or something. Are we using? Somebody just recently told me about this document, the Microsoft Azure document processing thing. Is that what we're using? No, it's AI machine learning model that Microsoft kind of released a few years back. We are using their version one. They did release other versions, but they are licensed. We could probably use them later time, but right now we should be fine with the version one, which is free, MIT licensed and it is freely available for commercial users. Okay? To me is document intelligence. AI azure. Com. So it's like. Their base level document. Somebody was doing the same. Something similar with marketing data. Some models. I thought this would be best fit for our financial processing. But that's one my research showed. But in the meantime, I do have something to demo. Here again. Nothing. This is just a first draft, so we can change whatever we want to. We can change the navigation, we can change font color wherever we want to, move things around. This is just the first draft that I'm showing it to you guys. So yeah. We do have. The deal pipeline here. And I do have New deal creation working. And basically once the user logs in, I think this is what we are referring to in the last call, that we should have something deal pipeline, something like this. So we can see the tables. This format, we can add more columns. And we do have a filter here. Once we apply the filter, it will have all the columns. We can definitely add more column. But right now I'm just showing you the limited columns. And then the user can always kind of choose what they want to see and what not, apart from that. We do have searching capabilities here. Let me bring back all columns. So suppose I just want to find my T, which is Mountain View, so you can search it that way. Sunset. And, you know, and then we do have filters available here. As well. We want to kind of apply the filter. Supp. Suppose I have, say, hundreds of deals. I'm just interested in one type of status or one type of portal. I can always search by these filters. And we can add more filters here. Right now. This is what I came up with.

### You (2025-08-05T21:43:32.394Z)

Yeah. But node make sure you go to make sure you go through the prd, because there's quite a few other columns.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:43:34.866Z)

So yeah.

### You (2025-08-05T21:43:38.074Z)

In there. Like favorite few other things. But. Yeah, I know this is just a demo.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:43:41.586Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-05T21:43:43.354Z)

So this looks good. I like it.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:43:47.826Z)

Yeah. Yeah. This is, like, the first version. So. And then I do have delete. I added and then perform a button here as well. Performa is also kind of in development, but user can go to performer directly from here. For that particular deal. I was kind of playing little bit with those two. One. That's kind of broken right now. I'm not sure. I think this. This is where we should focus majorly on these are kind of optional thing. Just keep it clean. And then build creation probably we can do here real quick. Let's see if this works. Property address or here. I would like to add the Google's address capability right now. I don't have, but I'll eventually add that. Please. Property type. Status active. Transition here. Then you can only choose the documentary. And create the area. I think that deal is created and we should have that sixth deal here that's get shown here in the pipeline. So that is that. And then I'm kind of still on the early phase of the property detail. But I think we still have something here. Something here. Again, I'll refer to the PRD document, but again, I just said this is very initial. Version, and we still have to work on this. Yes. It's cool. Looks great. Yeah. Yeah. I think I would show you this much. Now and then, you know, in the next meeting, probably will have some more progress. In demo that you guys. Okay? This looks awesome. Though. I mean. I mean, that's great progress. Yeah. I can push this to a stage so that you guys can kind of, you know, play with it. On on your own as well. Okay? And Howard, Probably. We can sync on this. And make it better. Whatever changes. We need to do. We can kind of go.

### You (2025-08-05T21:46:38.714Z)

Looks great.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:46:39.346Z)

Yeah, that's all from my side. Guys. Okay? Looks great. Yeah. Howard. Anything on your end? I'm trying to think of some of the things we've been talking about. If any of it rises to an all hands. Update.

### You (2025-08-05T21:47:01.354Z)

Yeah. I will be circulating the pricing recommendations tomorrow. So got a lot of work done on that today. I think that's about it. I have not really done anything else. On my call with the node yesterday. I am keeping my hands off the POC at this point. There's nothing left for me to add to that. So it's just a matter of making sure we can get him focused on the mvp. And not distracted with other little bells and whistles that we might come up with in the meantime. And then I did send you the AI roadmap document. Send me in the chat there. But yeah. That's it. It's really been kind of focusing on the pricing. Drew, I would like to get with you because I know I've got on my checklist. Also the agreement in terms of service. Documents, but you said we might be able to utilize yours. Or base hours off of yours. So could you just maybe send me a copy or upload it into the team site?

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:48:24.066Z)

Yeah. In terms of service, you said.

### You (2025-08-05T21:48:30.314Z)

I already have a terms of service, but I'd like to compare it to what you've got.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:48:38.386Z)

We don't really have a. We have an nsa. Master Service agreement.

### You (2025-08-05T21:48:42.714Z)

Probably.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:48:43.586Z)

Everything includes our terms of service.

### You (2025-08-05T21:48:44.954Z)

We had them as separate documents. And I don't know why. Red iq. I've had them consolidated in the past. I think it's a lot easier to have it. Rolled into a single document. Yeah. I think Red iq though. One reason why they kept it separate.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:48:59.346Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:02.714Z)

Is is with the terms of service. You can change it. And just ask people to initial or confirm rather than changing the entire agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:10.146Z)

Y eah.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:15.674Z)

I don't know if that makes any difference or not.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:21.186Z)

Yeah, I think that is. Yeah. There are advantages to that. We have some customers that have marked up our msa.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:35.994Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:36.226Z)

And added or removed certain provisions.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:36.474Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:38.866Z)

Which we're not big enough, that that matters all that much.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:39.434Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:43.026Z)

But I don't know how that works. I think if you get big enough, you could just say, take it or leave it.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:46.314Z)

Yeah. Pretty much every place I've worked at.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:47.986Z)

This is it.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:50.234Z)

That's part of the sales job. There.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:49:55.106Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-05T21:49:57.274Z)

But no, that. That's. That's what I'm working on right now. As well as I did forward some information for Mark for your.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:50:03.666Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-05T21:50:09.354Z)

You're putting together. You would ask for some of those other things too.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:50:16.626Z)

Thank you. That was very helpful. We were talking about that. Earlier today. Which might be a good transition for us to give you guys an update on the call with Ryan, Millike and Lark yesterday. Dan did not join. So it was just Ryan, which was good. I mean, Mark had a good point. That Ryan was probably more candid with us. On the phone without having Dan part of it. So he gave us a lot of candid feedback. And, I don't know, Drew and Mark. Do you guys want to take a stab at summarizing it? For everyone. Because there were a lot of good takeaways. And I know all three of us were on the call. But sometimes I can get a very emotionally invested in these things. And so it'd be good, perhaps, for you guys to share your feedback. On how it went because you're probably a little more neutral. Than I am. Yeah. I mean, it went well. Told us that he and his parent company kind of looked at doing this themselves. A while back, decided not to do it. Because they thought it would be cost prohibited in the market. Size wasn't big enough. And I think that was really due to just the assumptions. The kind of products they were looking to develop. It's a little bit different than what we are. And then the assumptions they were making about the market and who would be interested. I don't think necessarily matters to us, per se. But it was interesting to note. And then as far as some of the. He noticed some potential challenges. And features that would be interesting to factor in. So I did add some of those to our what is it. The parking lot, and I added some of the. Some of them to our business operations. Trello board. I thought in all it was a really very productive, candid, helpful conversation. And at the end of it, his perspective was that he's totally happy to share. The data. This market data, which I think is really useful. For us. And I got to follow up with them right now to ask you to send the first set of test files. But this will go into the underwriting. Model basically in that. In the penetration analysis in that top row of AR RevPAR. Right. So it'll give us the market projections. And so when users when we start getting the historicals for particular deal populated, then they can use the market forecast to get a sense of what if you go to market is doing and then underwrite their property accordingly. So it'll be a very useful metric to have a useful set of data to have in there. Yeah. I mean, just to add a little bit. I've now been on a couple of calls. And it seems like there's a few consistent themes. One is just general apprehension. About trying to convince the industry. That they should leave Excel. And we need to do a really good job of showing people that this is intuitive, user friendly, and, quite frankly, very similar to Excel. But that it's the future. So I think that 's a relatively explainable issue. But with the industry, but people have said is one that they get that there's four or five different kinds of users for this product. But they seem to feel very strongly that in order for them to use the product, it needs to really be customizable. Because every one of the five different types of users that we all think will use this have different needs. And we need to have some kind of menu that allows really, the outputs. To be designed in a way that meets the needs of the specific user. But the thing that's on everyone's mind is AI and how we're going to take this new model. And really use it. To build for the future. And I think that. We need to do a really good job. Of explaining how we see this model integrating with AI. And, yeah, I don't think that we certainly need to have this all done. Obviously in version one, but I think we need to show them how we plan to build the AI and equally important, the API connections. I think everyone feels that it's a huge waste of time. And effort and money to be constantly downloading all this information. And to the extent that we can show them our roadmap to API, we could show them how using a better, more innovative model will lead to better AI utilization, better data utilization. It seems like everyone is focused on that. And that's where I think people want the conversation to go. Talking about the base model is interesting, but I think most people are comfortable with their base models, so we have to convince them to leave with their comfortable with and move to the future. And the inducements move to the future. Is better API connectivity. To save time, better data utilization, and ultimately, better AI analytics. That's really, to me and just based on the conversations I've had, what people are really most interested in. Yeah. And Ryan did pointedly asked. Are you planning to use AI? We told them sort of the three main things that we're planning. The ability to pull data from PNLs and OMS to populate underwriting models. The ability to use AI to do, like, broad market research. Very quickly pulling data floats available online and. To load, abstract, categorize, organize documents related to a deal. His first feedback or his reaction to those three points was very positive. And, Howard, the article that you sent out this morning really kind of summarized it well. Talked about companies needing to sort of abandon their comfort zones and start moving into the technological future. So that they can use data, they can use AI. So it was funny because that article I was reading this morning, it was basically a summary of every conversation I've had in the last couple of weeks about InnVestAI. Everyone is struggling to figure out they need to tell their bosses what their plan is for AI. What their plan is for Data.

### You (2025-08-05T21:57:15.514Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T21:57:27.906Z)

This is on everyone's mind. So I think the timing is good. We just have to work on our talking points and ultimately deliver from a technological perspective as well. Yeah. I can definitely send you guys some topping point on AI. I want you to understand from the API front, right? So. So when we say API. So we'll basically provide user their data, right? Just their data. And they can do whatever they want to do with it. Create their own dashboard, create their power. Bi Yeah. I use AI as like, a generic term for connectivity. Describe it. Stating about API connections. API. This is already been put. We put this. In the whatever. Parking lot. I think we've talked about it otherwise, but, yeah. API out. So a rest API available. So users can hold their underwriting, let's say, right? Like out of InnVestAI and pull it into some other platform. And Hotel Bis would absolutely be interested in that. Because we want our customers that they're doing underwriting InnVestAI. We want them to be able to then view and compare data to the X forecast or what do budgets or whatever, to the performance data that they've done in the messai. And then the flip side of that is being able to tap into APIs that are available in the industry. I think that's one of the areas where hospitality is lagging. Yeah. Common theme is that we have to give people a reason to abandon their comfort zone. And leave their current models. And that's where the conversation about the future. Really comes into play. So we have to just make a very strong presentation. There. The question of APIs becomes. I mentioned this before, it's less a technology thing. It's a business and operational thing. Profit sort has an API. That's fantastic. If you can get access to it. Then it's great. I'm sure it's very easy to use. But they don't just give that out. Right. You have to be a vetted, verified partner, that is, in order to get access to it. Or one of their customers has to say yes. Give so and so access to the API. But they're not also going to do that willy Nilly either. So I think we should continue to say that we are going to use APIs. And we will use APIs. But again, I don't think that's a technology challenge. Or issue. I think that's getting an API so you can get it. It's easier than doing it any other way. Actually. Right. But I also think we need to explain what we're going to do with it. Right. So yesterday we had that conversation about could we download management and franchise agreements and have AI provide a summary of them? Just. That was sort of a. I think we need to work. And this is more like. Drew, you and I and Diane, we can sort of think through on the deck. Side. How we want to explain this, but that seems to be what people want to hear. I really do believe things like being able to tap into Ryan's API on real estate tax data, being able to tap into Procors workflow streams. On renovations. Right. Because there are hotel project managers who use Procore for their renovation management. Being to tap into platforms like Harvey that are emerging for legal workflows. So that basically when you're in InnVestAI, you kind of are able to see all the parts of your deal coming together and you don't have to go out and have a completely different workflow or email chain or something like that. To bring in some of the renovation information. Diane, can you just run through that? I wanted to make a list. I think it's good to have a list of who we are. Aspirational connections. Are to who are first and foremost is procore and there's going to be some networking that needs to be done. What I see that we can do with procore is. Procore is like the GC platform. Out there. In the space. They also have a module for owners. And developers. But what I could see us doing is working with Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, IHG and essentially almost creating a hotel module. That works. And integrates with Procore because the Berends give you a pip, right? It's a hard. I mean, it's a. It's an Excel or hard copy, Pip, with all the things that you need to do to renovate that hotel. And so in the underwriting file, where we have the capex and when Howard shows, you can put a new roof in and it's $300,000. What would be awesome. Is if we could literally click into Procore right through an integration. And be able to see that this is a $10 million renovation. And os and E. I'm making numbers up here. Is like 1.5 million. And this is, you know, you can start to go deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into the renovation work. Real quick. Though. This sounds like you're talking about taking the PIP documents and being able to get a price estimate of them. Right. Well, no. While we wouldn't be getting the price estimate. They would be getting just the way the workflows work right now. Would be the GC going out to the subs and bidding it. And there probably using someone in the early stages to give them just a pricing estimate. We would not get into the game of giving price estimates. What we would be doing, though, is essentially letting them access all the detail of that. Right. So you're talking about just like instead of receiving an email with a PDF of the kit, you're talking about having someplace where. The information is put that's like, organized on a platform. Yet. By the way, Aman pro course. Site right now. And they just launched a product called Procore Helix, which is their new intelligence layer. Powering the future of construction through Generative AI Agents. Insights and analytics. So again, everyone is using. Everyone's sort of jumping on this fuss, if you will. And I just think we have to just sort of work that into our messaging as much as we can. Because that's really what the investors, and quite frankly, the users want to hear. And I think this is very much a marketing sales, like we need to do marketing tomorrow. Right. This is not going to happen. In the mvp. It might not even happen in version one or two. Just to be clear. I'm not suggesting. I'm not suggesting we have it in version one. I'm just saying that we have to present a roadmap. To show people where we intend to go. And we could say it's version three. We can say version four. But we just have to show them what our plan is. Right, so that they give us credit. Now for what we plan to do a year from now. Right. And Mark and Drew and everyone can Google this company. There is a company called Mindclick. Andrea foster. Joined them about a year ago. And I always forget who her. Russ. Is it russ urban? Who is her partner? I get the Russell Munn and Russell Urban confused. But she basically, what they do is they work with the Berends And they have long standing 15 year relationships with the ANC departments of the Berends They work for the Berends to identify what sustainable products are being used in renovations. And so Andrea suggested that we talk to the head of Mindclick. Her name is Joanna. She is a tech investor. Herself. And like a strategic partnership with Mindclick, because they've already got the relationships with the ANC departments of the Berends Right. So we could almost just, like, tack on their workflows. And their relationships. With the groups that are actually issuing the pips. So that's something that's on my list. Over the next week to follow up with. But that's the first one that I think we should tackle is the Capex, because hotels have been delinquent and renovating, right? And we're hitting now 8 and 9 year marks where hotels haven't been renovated. It's showing. Berends are not going to let that continue. So I think Capex is going to be a big thing. For our industry. Plus, every hotel acquisition or loan that's made always involves a capex component, so it's kind of universal. Yes. The second is a platform called Harvey. It's winning all kinds of accolades with the legal workflow, digitization. What? I don't know. Is if, by the way, it's not called harvey AI, it's called harvey AI, right? So everyone is. So we are InnVestAI right? And what we need to do as a company is we know the hotel attorneys, right? So we need to convene a group of hotel attorneys. And start to ask, how are they digitizing? What are they using, Harvey? Are they using Ironclad? What are they doing? Because it would be really, really great to be able to get those workflows. In and out of InnVestAI. So when you're negotiating documents, you're not going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. An email. Those are to ryan. I talked about Ryan because of the real estate tax and then just starting to understand the closing process, what's getting digitized from Commonwealth title and other things. So those are the ones that are very, very top of mind for me. And I think could make people's lives so much easier. If we could create. And maybe it's not called an API integration anymore. We might. That might be an old school term, but an ability to have these agents work with these other platforms. And again. And then we talked about Lark, of course. Yeah. Lark. Lark is huge. Yeah. But again, though, a lot of these companies, they have APIs. That's not right. It's about how do we get access to them. And that's what we do. Thinking about, right? So, Diane, you mentioned something a while back, or I think it was one of the features we talked about. That Howard Manona did mention this to you guys, too, but it's like having. If you do it, you have your historical numbers. Your projection numbers. In the pro forma. And then if you have benchmark, right. Like customers can use their existing portfolio. To do benchmarks. Their existing portfolios. Yes. Right. So in order to do that, They have to load the data from their existing portfolio. Right. That's not a technology thing. That's a business operational mechanism to get them to give us the data. To get them to open up the API. Right. That's the kind of thing that we need to be thinking about, right? So saying procore. Exactly. It. Totally understand what you're saying. And harvey. How do we persuade those companies to give us access? And if we have hundreds of customers, whatever. It's less of an issue. Because those customers will tell Harvey and tell Procore. Even best AI it would just be a natural thing. Profit Short and M3 have used the same APIs transfer data back and forth thousands of times. Now, at this point, But we need to be thinking about the business and operational mechanisms that we're going to use. To get access to the APIs. But I think that the best way to get access is to pay them. And to come up with some kind of method. Of giving them some kind of payment so that when you talk about this earlier today, If we're charging 30,000 a year, just as an example. Know, Maybe we charge 33,000 and we sort of build in a reserve. So that every one of time one of our customers clicks on Harvey or Procore. They get a payment.

### You (2025-08-05T22:10:30.714Z)

Yeah. I was going to say, I've been waiting for a second to kind of jump in here.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:10:32.706Z)

Whatever's their market rate, right?

### You (2025-08-05T22:10:35.194Z)

You're not going to have a choice. People do not give away their data for free. And I have implemented a large number of APIs with different companies, and most of them will charge based on the amount of data. That passes through the API. So if you're just collecting a little bit of data, it might be a tenth of a penny for something real. Page will charge you a flat fee of $25,000 a year, plus the amount of data that's coming through. So none of this is going to be free. It's going to cost, right? And depending. So the question is, number one, are we going to be able to pass that cost through, or is the data source that we're getting just so exorbitant that. We'd lose money on it, right? I just want to make sure everybody is aware that this isn't just something we can call it up and say, hey, can we connect to your API? And that's it. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:11:42.226Z)

Yeah. Well, if it's a shared customer. If we had Davidson, let's say as a customer. Right. I don't know if they use procore, but they use Profit Sword. They use M3. Let's say they use Procore. Let's. I think the way a lot of those systems work is if there is an API cost, it's paid by the company.

### You (2025-08-05T22:12:03.034Z)

Sometimes, yes.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:12:03.826Z)

It's paid by the customer. Right. Or build back of it. Right? So like, I mean, ideally, that would be the way to do it. But you can only do that. If you. Again, if you have. Like, right now we're in this back and forth of M3 where, like, we want to use their API. And they're like, okay. Well, it's $50 a month. Or something like that. And the operators are like, well, we don't want to pay it. And I was like, well, I don't want to pay it. So we have some poor draft. Director of Finance. Manually crunching data into an Excel file that they load into our system. And I'm hoping that they get pissed off enough doing that. That eventually I find, fuck it, I'll pay the $50 a month.

### You (2025-08-05T22:12:46.474Z)

They will typically charge development fee, even though it's kind of a standard API. They're all going to say, oh, well, we have to do this customized work. It's going to be $500. An hour and at about 50 hours. Right. I mean, they're going to come up with a reason before even connected to charge for that.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:13:04.706Z)

Y eah.

### You (2025-08-05T22:13:07.354Z)

But yeah. It's all going to come right down. I mean, if you got somebody the size of Marriott or Hyatt that's breathing down somebody's neck, saying, I'm your customer, I'm their customer. I need this API. They'll be written.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:13:24.226Z)

Yes. So. Actually, Howard, that. Can I jump in there for a minute? Because I talk about 5th wall all the time. Right. I don't know if 5th wall will be in our future. Three or five years from now. But this is where I keep going back to. Fifth Wall has six hotel investors. In their fund host marriott, hilton, cbre, mgm and ryman 6 and they have only my knowledge. Backed one hotel product, which is called Wander. It's a competitor to Airbnb, and I don't really see how that helps. The six investors. That are in their fund. But Fifth Wall is also an investor. In procore, right? It's a big investment for them. So you can kind of start to see now if we work these relationships the right way. This is what the beauty of a fifth wall is, is that it's like they're trying to connect the users with other service providers, right? So if we got Marriott and Hilton, right? In a room and said, hey, they're an investor in Procore. What do we do? We need Propor to be more prevalent in the hotel industry. So it's going to take some time. And relationship building. The fifth wall. A bunch of our partners went to Princeton. They're all alumni from Princeton. When I went to undergrad, so a couple of my guys a couple of years older than me actually worked for them. But diane is right. Fifth of all is like a three to five year dream. That's not. It's not immediate, right? But we can start to network a little bit. And again, the fact that you have all these hotel investors. In fifth wall. I'm sad for them. They're not getting a return on their investment because they're not fifth walls, not really investing in any hospitality products. But just to go back to what we're talking about, APIs. I fully agree, like Mark, with what you're emphasizing, that we need to be sure to address the use of APIs when we talk to customers and investors and whatnot. And from a product perspective. Howard. No. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think using an API is, like, a very easy thing to do as long as you have access to it.

### You (2025-08-05T22:15:50.314Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:15:54.946Z)

And you can fit the data from the source system into your data model. It's like APIs, they're plug and play. Versus a data extract or something like that. Right. So from a technology perspective, I think it's good. We're good on that. But what we have to think about is the business mechanism that we're going to use to expand those aviation. Whether it's yeah. So dro, you are talking about consuming other platforms. API earlier. I was referring to opening our APIs to other platforms. Yeah. I'm talking about consuming data. We want to be able to get data from profits. Order M3 or Procore or whatever. But we have to get out. We have to have those companies give us access to the APIs. Right. So that's what I'm talking about. Thinking about Vinod. There might be situations where we're providing our data. Other people. Are great example of that. They could really use our data if we can get it at scale for hospitality. Because they're making a lot of strides. With investment management companies and then their connection into Juniper Square. So that's one that pops out on me on the reverse. We should be funneling our data up into peer review, and that's a good potential mechanism to get access to an API. Right. We'll give you access to ours if you give us access to your. And please, Howard and Vino, don't freak out about the APIs, because there's lots of talk and sometimes we can get really excited about things. But just in general, in theory. This should be due in some way, right? This should be doable over the next couple of nothing freaking out about API that's actually is your for us to develop them extracting the data from unstructured data.

### You (2025-08-05T22:17:52.154Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:17:56.706Z)

And structural flex. I just want to make sure you know that we're not trying to go off on some crazy tangent. We're going to hang up, and you guys are going to be like those There are notters. Right. What are they saying? Bring everything, whatever can be useful to the discussion. We can if something is not doable. We can always push back. Right. I know we're talking about. So Howard says this all the time. Right. That the workflows are great. But it's the data. That is the most valuable thing. And whoever wins Data wins AI. So I want to go back to the procore idea for a moment because there is so little visibility or comparability within PIPs. Right. It's just like you get your pip, it gets priced. Then you get your final pricing and maybe it's 15% higher because of labor. The data that could exist for us. If we were to be able to capture digitally that PIP information, I think would be as valuable as a Cap Rate database. I just put that into our AI use cases on Trello. But the ability to abstract tips and provide cost estimates. And again, that only works if you have a robust data set of knowing that when the PIP says roomless corridor renovations. At cost, how much and if you have 100 properties. And you can get a range of cost, then the AI model can say, okay. This is a select service property. This brand, this location. I can give you a cost estimate or a range. I think that would be amazing. We can get good data set. Which we may organically grow over time. Or we will organically obtain over time. Or if we can get some, like we were talking about with Lark. Right. Like Brian mentioned, using the LW PNLs. If we can just get somebody to dump us a couple thousand pips. And the related costs and boom. You have 10 different data model. Right. And it could help the Berends too. Because they have to track all those pips. Right. That's a nightmare for them. As well. To do that. Anyway. Okay? Let's see. One last thing on the conversation with Ryan. At the very, very end, he said, we have a client that could be interested in your platform. He wouldn't tell us who the client was. He said they were sizable. He said they would need a lot of customization. He said they would pay a lot of money for the product. And he said that LW would want. Drew had to deseless. Like a piece of the pie or to be have a steak or steak and I don't know. I think those might have been I think those might have even been separate comments. Yeah. He was just a big customer. Whoever it is. Would want a lot of, you know, they want to have a say in how we develop things. And to actually go back to that comment about bigger customers. Wanting customization. This is Mark. Dang. We've talked about this yesterday, but just Howard and Minotz. You're aware. Like, one of the, I guess, like, downside assumptions that Ryan and his team had made out why they decided not to do this is they thought that big companies like Blackstone and Starwood, et cetera. Would probably want to do it themselves. Versus use an off the shelf product. And I think our assumption is that that is true. They will want customization, but they're not going to build it entirely from scratch. Right. So I think our product will be useful. To customers like that. As long as it provides the right level of customization.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:03.514Z)

So that's a pretty broad term.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:04.306Z)

And I don't think that's even that much customization.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:07.994Z)

Right. Can we start documenting what you mean by customization report? Customization? Simple stuff.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:13.666Z)

So.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:17.914Z)

If it's just reporting, that's not a problem.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:20.786Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:21.514Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:21.666Z)

Report customers. I think customization, I think it's really more like output pages.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:23.994Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:27.906Z)

Like if you're an investor, you own IRR equity multiple and cash on cash. If you're a lender, you want debt yield, debt service coverage ratio, that kind of thing.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:37.514Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:38.466Z)

So they want to be able to have the output pages.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:40.394Z)

Yeah. I mean, we could have a report builder.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:22:41.746Z)

I think that's really where he's going with that.

### You (2025-08-05T22:22:42.874Z)

Essentially where you could have the. A report available, and you can just check which columns you want to have included, or you could reorder the columns. I mean, you could basically replicate an existing report that you have. That's not a problem. My only my concern is when you talk about customization. It's like, are they going to want to have the. UI different. Are we going to have to have a different screen for everybody? That would be unmanageable. Okay.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:23:10.866Z)

Yeah. I think. I think it's really output page. Yeah. Alpha pages, and I think maybe they'll want a different driver. Right. Like somewhere, which is probably the most difficult of the custom that somebody's going to want. But I think the data, like the organization and structure of the data. The whole benefit is that people want it standard. Right. So hence, there won't really be a lot of customization there.

### You (2025-08-05T22:23:39.114Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:23:43.746Z)

And our platform Hotel BI is the same kind of thing. Which is why Starwood actually uses us and just we're like a pass through. And they push the data up into Cherry and Anaplan. They use Anaplan to do their underwriting. And they hotel people hate it because it was developed with hotels. Not being kind of the primary use case. So if we were to target Starwood as a customer, We'd want to be able to say, like, look, your hotel people can use this. And it'll work for them. It's built for hotels. And we can push the data into charity just like you were getting it from Animal Plan. And so they can get their customization is in the integration of different systems.

### You (2025-08-05T22:24:15.354Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:24:24.146Z)

Basically. And in what somebody like Barry Stern sees as far as his reports,

### You (2025-08-05T22:24:26.234Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:24:29.986Z)

Right, because hotel groups are always the last ones with their hands out. Like. Wait, what about me? And the company's like, no, no. We have multifamily. We have to. Accomplish first, right? Or no. Now we need data centers. That's what we're going to focus on.

### You (2025-08-05T22:24:45.594Z)

Well, from a customization standpoint,

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:24:45.746Z)

You hotel people, you're too small.

### You (2025-08-05T22:24:48.714Z)

I mean, I've been thinking all along. I mean, that's one reason why I put together all those Personas. We know that we probably will want a distinctly different tool for the equity side than we do on the debt side, right? I've heard a lot of comments about on the debt side. They don't need all that level of granularity. There's a few other things we could create reports specific to that. So when we sign up an account, We would need to know which, basically, which of these Personas fit your organization and if they're on the debt side. Anytime they log in, they would just be accessing that. Debt related model. If they're an investor or broker or somebody in the equity side, they would get something that's geared more towards them. And that would also then make the output a lot easier. Right? Instead of having to have multiple outputs coming from a single model. You could have. At least we'd have it split up into two different models. And they would look very similar, and they would use a lot of the same components on the back end. It's just a way of how would we present it in the ui? Okay? That's fine. I was quite nervous. When I hear the word customization. But if it's on the reporting side, that's pretty.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:26:26.786Z)

This first client, though, that they're talking about. I don't know what the customization. We have done a very good job of building the data and the underwriting up from scratch, just like people underwrite it in real life. Right. So I feel really good about that. So I don't know what customization they're thinking. But, man, if they have a big client and we could get that person signed on early, that's what we need to take to investors.

### You (2025-08-05T22:26:50.234Z)

Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:26:53.906Z)

Right. Is to show like, oh, we already have this. Whatever the client is. As Marcus said, that would make the fundraising.

### You (2025-08-05T22:27:00.554Z)

Oh, yeah. We've talked about that.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:27:02.626Z)

So much easier.

### You (2025-08-05T22:27:02.634Z)

All along. If we could get the Berkadia team to sign on. And we've always talked about we need to get users. Helping us out. As soon as possible. Or any of these other contacts that we have. Actually using the tool we've talked about Client Advisory Group, and if we could get the group together and go for that. That would be huge. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:27:40.226Z)

Okay? All right, everyone. Have a good evening. Before we go. What are we doing about the website and fixing the response? I'm sorry. I haven't got to it, but I'll do that. Most probably today. Thank you. Put it, tom. My notes before I forget it. Thank you.

### You (2025-08-05T22:28:03.834Z)

Cool. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:28:06.386Z)

All right. Everyone. We will talk Thursday.

### You (2025-08-05T22:28:07.754Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-08-05T22:28:11.346Z)

Thanks.
