# Transcript for: LLC separation strategy with Diane and Mark conflict resolution

### You (2025-11-25T18:15:09.328Z)

Good this morning, little one on one.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:15:11.328Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:15:13.728Z)

A regular one on one. So during tonight's call, She wanted. To basically let the team know that. She's been extremely busy at Kroger. I might have a chance to read through the LLC Wednesday and let everybody know that she can't get to it until Friday or Saturday. And I basically told her that. It's not going to well at all.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:15:48.368Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:15:50.048Z)

And basically. She? And I. Decided that. She's not going to sign the llc, period. We want to start with Mark and to say that she needs more time to review it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:16:08.688Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:16:09.008Z)

Is. Not wise.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:16:11.648Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:16:13.968Z)

So she agreed that in tonight's call, she is just going to. Come right out and say, I just can no longer work with Mark. I'm not going to sign. The llc. Or. Go on. She will probably also say that we can discuss. Terms of separation, after which, because I know that Mark is claiming to insist on getting something out of it, he's going to want his money back or whatever.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:16:45.408Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:16:45.728Z)

But I told. Her. Do not get into those discussions in tonight's call. I mean, it could be a five minute call. She might just say, I am not going to do this. Sorry. And. We can talk about the details afterwards. So in the meantime, you see her emails. She's got the books to come open, she's deposited the money in.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:17:06.688Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:17:10.208Z)

There.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:17:10.368Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:17:11.008Z)

Because I did tell her that. I still don't know if Drew is just going to walk away or if he will try to salvage. Which is fine. She would be happy to work with him. As long as there's no communication with Mark. So we also had a meeting with the Benchmarker team again today.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:17:36.288Z)

Right. Right? Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:17:38.208Z)

Which went extremely well.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:17:41.168Z)

Right, okay.

### You (2025-11-25T18:17:43.328Z)

We could be partnering with them. Because CBRE is no longer supporting that on December 31st, which I kind of mentioned that to you before.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:17:55.568Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:17:57.968Z)

He's going to talk to. The person who's heading it up, whose last day will be January 1st. And. See if he would like to help. With basically creating Benchmark or version 2. We can't copy it. We don't want to get involved with any ip. Arguments, but we want to find out what he's capable of assisting with. And we could have that integrated. Very quickly. So Diane is thinking about, do we have two companies? We just do a revenue share. How are we going to do that? But we've got the details. We need to work out the details. But he may even be interested in becoming an investor, partner, founder, In the whole thing as well, so could be more investment money coming in there.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:18:59.088Z)

Okay, okay.

### You (2025-11-25T18:18:59.968Z)

Yeah. So. So I go back in. I would get, you know, in advance. I don't want to get blindsided by anything that happens in today's call. But, you know, I showed her that, you know. You've told her? I've told her we fully support her. You know, we're not going to get caught in the middle.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:19:16.928Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:19:18.208Z)

And that, you know, we'll just have to execute a new LLC with the three of us. After. All this goes down. Her husband's friend. That was the end. That. That's the attorney.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:19:36.448Z)

Right. All right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:19:37.808Z)

He is interested. In helping us out again. She was concerned that he lost interest and didn't want to be involved or anything. But he's actually been giving her some advice on how to handle this with Mark.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:19:52.208Z)

Okay? So he'll help us out from the legal perspective.

### You (2025-11-25T18:19:55.968Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:19:58.928Z)

Okay, cool. What? What? A ton. Easy. Like, is he a corporate attorney or what kind of.

### You (2025-11-25T18:19:59.648Z)

So. Yeah, I think he's just. I don't remember what exactly he specialized in, but he kind of gave her some advice on the setup.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:20:11.488Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:20:17.328Z)

She says that they researched the Delaware law, and since we don't have a signed llc. They don't feel that anything that was in any verbal or email commitments are legally binding. So, you know, the thing that I brought up in this whole issue is that, well, LARC has probably been a lawyer up and sue and say that, you know, he was promised this position that the head of verbal agreement that you know he's 1/5 of the founding team. And everything else, but they feel pretty good that just because, you know, we have a verbal agreement, And even possibly emails going back and forth and say, you know, you. You're one fifth of the team. That that wouldn't really hold up, so. And then what I suggested is, you know, I don't know what document or what you had to sign with with Radix. But what? What? I had to sign. And I also had to do the same thing with Rampage. Was, you know, in order to get any type of a severance package, you had to sign this agreement. And part of the agreement was a non disparagement clause, meaning you can't go out and put negative feedback on the web or you can't make disparaging remarks about them. And I told my head, let's do the same thing with Mark. He's definitely not going to just say, oh, okay. Thanks anyway. Good luck.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:21:49.088Z)

Yeah, right, right. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:21:50.608Z)

So I think we would. We would probably end up offering him something. I mean, who knows? Maybe. Maybe he still holds equity and, you know, just.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:21:59.648Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:00.688Z)

In return, we would have to have a non disparagement in there too because she's still concerned that, you know, he could go out there and bad mouthus. But if we had some type of.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:09.488Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:12.448Z)

Separation agreement or whatever you want to call it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:13.568Z)

Right. Right, right, right. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:14.928Z)

That has a nondisparagement clause in there that would minimize the chances of him going out and badmouthing anybody.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:15.888Z)

Right. Right? Right. Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:25.088Z)

Okay? All right, well. Just wanted to make sure you were aware. And I don't know if you have any second thoughts or if there's any concerns that you have, but I think.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:34.528Z)

Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:36.448Z)

You know, if. If she doesn't.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:37.008Z)

Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:39.328Z)

Officially, informally and and quickly. Ties with Mark. We can't. We can't drag any of this out. Any longer.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:46.768Z)

Yeah, I think that was the very good advice you gave. Because I also thought she was just dragging it because she doesn't want to work with Mark and she's not able to put her thoughts together.

### You (2025-11-25T18:22:59.088Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:22:59.888Z)

So it's good that she's just, you know, declaring it now. If she. She's 100% decided that she doesn't want to work with Mark, then, you know, let's let it out. Otherwise, just not going to work out.

### You (2025-11-25T18:23:09.168Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:23:14.528Z)

In long term.

### You (2025-11-25T18:23:15.488Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:23:16.048Z)

So that is good, that benchmark thing, right? Isn't that benchmark very similar to what we are doing with InnVestAI.

### You (2025-11-25T18:23:24.528Z)

No. It is very similar to the costar the. The Star Report.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:23:29.088Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:23:32.048Z)

That's one of the things we're going to talk about. In the call today. And? And I will make sure that you're part of this. Is they want to set up a call with. The. Day that people.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:23:47.968Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:23:48.528Z)

So there's one guy I forgot. I think it's Paul. Who's like the VP that runs it now, and then there's some other people that report to him. That actually work. The data. When they receive it. And you know. They've got some APIs that they use and different things, and so they're going to want to review their database. They're set up. And what. What do they have? What data are they gathering? What would be useful to us? What wouldn't? So. So, yeah, definitely want to have. You on the call as well. When I get that invitation. And. We'll. We'll see what we can do. But.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:24:30.688Z)

Who was this guy? Who was this guy that you are having call with today? Is he from business or what?

### You (2025-11-25T18:24:36.608Z)

Yeah. No, here's our. I mentioned to you before, his name is Lar, and he's actually the one who basically invented the benchmarker tool.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:24:41.488Z)

Ok? Ay.

### You (2025-11-25T18:24:48.768Z)

And so the cbre, and he was retained on cbre. And so, you know, it's his product. He invented it, he put it together.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:24:51.808Z)

And.

### You (2025-11-25T18:25:00.128Z)

He's really angry at CBRE because they're just going to drop it. They're not going to support it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:25:06.608Z)

Okay, so he sold it to cbre. Okay. Okay, so which means. I mean, he sold it. I'm sure it would be a good deal. Like, he would have sold it for millions or something, right?

### You (2025-11-25T18:25:21.248Z)

I'm sure.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:25:21.728Z)

So probably he would be interested in, like, coming in as an investor as well, right? He'll invest us. Okay. Yeah, that's good. So what is his background?

### You (2025-11-25T18:25:31.008Z)

Yes. I. I don't know. He's like everywhere. He's been a volatile industry his whole entire life. He's another one that I told you.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:25:40.688Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:25:43.088Z)

He's like, probably 70ish, plus or minus. So he's been around a long time.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:25:49.248Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:25:49.728Z)

Knows everybody. Will definitely be able to step in for. Introductions.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:25:59.968Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:26:01.168Z)

Their clients. Are all the big companies. They deal with Marriott, Hill and High. You know all of those people, our clients of theirs right now. He's already. Agreed that he will contact those people. And ask them to continue to upload their data.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:26:24.768Z)

Y. Eah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:26:25.248Z)

And what happened to us. Instead of going to cbr so.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:26:30.608Z)

But then we'll have to build that tool first, right? Then only they can approach. Are we going to get the code ways or database everything from them?

### You (2025-11-25T18:26:38.608Z)

That's what we need to find out. I mean, I. I don't think we're going to get the code base, and. And that's why I think we may end up building version two. So we probably can't.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:26:47.888Z)

Good. I mean, see, we are sitting in, like, it's almost, what, December? If they are kind of getting rid of that tool by December and that we just got one month to build that tool.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:01.008Z)

Yeah, we, we, we could roughly 50 APIs because. I got the sense during the call that each API was built for each individual company. It's not just one API. So there's we could build a Myriad API, then a Hilton API and a Hyde API. So basically, we're just going to have to figure out if they can just.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:27:16.928Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:24.608Z)

Export the data into a PDF or excel or whatever. And we'll. We'll deal with extracting the data. After the fact.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:27:32.448Z)

Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I mean, let's. Let's kind of, you know, roll those meetings. Sonar so that.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:41.088Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:27:41.728Z)

We can get this started.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:43.248Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:27:43.968Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:45.168Z)

I've been feeling pretty. Down. About everything that's going on. But these meetings with these guys really make me feel way. Better.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:27:56.608Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:27:57.008Z)

About what's going on. And what we can do. A lot.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:00.528Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:01.088Z)

Yeah. We could be way farther down the road. With a partnership, both in terms of. Clients.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:08.128Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:09.168Z)

Data, everything. It would just be a huge, huge advantage.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:14.528Z)

Yep, yep, definitely. Yeah. And I think other good thing you did was you kind of forged dying to put money in the account, open the account, kind of, you know, move in that direction. So that was also a good development that, you know, she. She understand the seriousness of it.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:25.968Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. She made a comment about.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:40.368Z)

Yeah. You called.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:41.088Z)

How. She was that.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:43.968Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:44.688Z)

That Lark accused her of fraud like that. That came from me, that didn't come from Lar. And I also like. Well, I didn't refuse you a fraud. I said it could look to an outsider. Like fraud.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:58.128Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:58.528Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:28:59.328Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:28:59.968Z)

So I had to clear that up, but I'm like, Don't get mad at Lark and get on a phone call and say, how dare you give me a.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:29:10.768Z)

Even Driftwood would take it like that. Right. So instead of company.

### You (2025-11-25T18:29:14.448Z)

Hi. I mean, the virus. Driftwood cfo and I saw. This going back here, pushing. Com and everything else. All the agreements are signed within BAS AI and it's like, yeah, I would. I would start. I would have stopped those future checks if I was then. So, yeah, it was just not good. It was just a poor choice.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:29:34.768Z)

Yep. Yep.

### You (2025-11-25T18:29:36.528Z)

But, yeah, I think that's. All water in the bids now. Let's just go forward. She did. Set up the. Direct deposits to go directly into the Brex account.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:29:51.248Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:29:52.368Z)

And that's another thing. Let's make sure that neither one of us snip invention, Brex. Markup call.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:00.208Z)

Yeah, right, right.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:00.448Z)

Yeah. Want. To make sure that.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:04.528Z)

Cool. Cool. I mean, from this point, one important thing for us would be to convince Drew to stay on.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:05.408Z)

Yeah. So. Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:12.208Z)

With us.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:13.168Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:14.208Z)

And I think we should be good. Mark is fine. Really. He can go.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:14.528Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. I think you and I both have a good relationship. With your know, you mentioned on the last call that he.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:24.048Z)

Ahead.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:26.208Z)

Was not happy with Diane. You know, Mark wasn't the only one, but I think. You and I could. Probably convince. Him to at least try.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:35.968Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:37.008Z)

Give us. Give us some thought. Don't just walk away because of the issue with Mark. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:43.328Z)

And also that he's been singing a lot with Mark. And he must be, you know, kind of having impact because of that, whatever he's been saying.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:54.848Z)

I'm sure he's had an influence. So that's.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:30:56.928Z)

Influencia.

### You (2025-11-25T18:30:57.728Z)

Yeah. So.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:31:01.808Z)

Cool. Great. Great. Thank you.

### You (2025-11-25T18:31:04.208Z)

RT of give you a heads up.

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:31:05.808Z)

Yep. Yep. And, I mean, if you have time, do look at the valuation page. I did make a lot of changes as far as the UX goes. I feel it looks much more better now. But let me know if anything needs to be changed.

### You (2025-11-25T18:31:21.808Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-25T18:31:22.928Z)
