# Transcript for: Safe note and loan funding strategy for InnVestAI founders

### You (2025-09-16T15:37:58.572Z)

Stop.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:37:59.692Z)

Weird. It was going to voicemail.

### You (2025-09-16T15:38:04.732Z)

Interesting. Yeah, I thought maybe you called and got another call and dropped. So. Yeah. Never had that happen before. I'll have to look into it.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:38:14.492Z)

All right, so I wanted to just chat about the first off, the lone safe note, all that.

### You (2025-09-16T15:38:22.332Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:38:23.532Z)

Is a safe node. Makes sense to you.

### You (2025-09-16T15:38:26.332Z)

It does. Although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable on it as you are. Just thinking not only the safe note, but some of the questions that Diane had about the equity part. And when I saw your response, though, it does still kind of confuse me. So my interpretation of paying back the loan via equity.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:38:57.852Z)

Well, the safe note, separate from the low. The safe note is what we would use to take to Mike Sherman and to Cartwhee. That's just one conversation.

### You (2025-09-16T15:39:06.252Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:39:10.812Z)

And I sent a link to a guy who's had some videos because I'm not super knowledgeable all these things either, even though I've done some of them.

### You (2025-09-16T15:39:10.972Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:39:20.252Z)

But I think the safe note in particular is very simple. This agreement says that you're going to get shares in the company at some later date when the value of shares are determined.

### You (2025-09-16T15:39:36.332Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:39:37.052Z)

And there's pre money and post money, which is two different ways to calculate the valuation or that ownership interest or percentage interest. And then there's a convertible note, which is a little bit different. The video I sent covered. The guy talks about all of them, which is. He's really very clear. I thought it was very helpful. The valuation cap has nothing to do. It is not the valuation of the company.

### You (2025-09-16T15:40:00.652Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:40:01.372Z)

Right now. It is the maximum value at which that person's equity gets converted. So if you end up raising the company valued at $10 million,

### You (2025-09-16T15:40:07.932Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:40:14.012Z)

And the valuation cap, it's 5 million. Then that means the investor is going to get basically, like, twice as many shares for the amount of money that they gave us for the safe. No.

### You (2025-09-16T15:40:27.612Z)

That makes sense. I wasn't very clear on that either, but you're more recent email helped with that. The difference between valuation valuation cap.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:40:39.372Z)

Okay. Yeah. And then the loan. Diana had a lot. There was a section in the operating agreement that talked about. Owner distributions and somebody not wanting to take an owner distribution can put it basically an escrow and it earns interest and then is converted. And then it's converted back to. You can basically Mark and I wouldn't take distribution because we don't need it. So it would stay in escrow, it would earn interest, and then after a certain period of time, we could convert it back into equity for more shares. And the reason to do it that way is because if you have equal partners or any stake in the company, Like all of our shares are of the same type, right? They're not like, you know, common shares. Preferred shares, whatever. All the same type. We all have to do the same thing. We all have to. If somebody takes the distribution of $2,000. We all have to take a distribution of $2,000 based on our equal share. Or, you know, or if we had different percentage ownership, then it would just be prorated based on our percentage ownership. But the point being that, like, no one person can take a distribution without everybody taking it.

### You (2025-09-16T15:41:55.452Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:41:55.532Z)

Which is why that language is in the operating agreement.

### You (2025-09-16T15:41:58.652Z)

Right, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:42:01.612Z)

So you guys taking distributions or Diane taking you distribution and Mark and I not taking distribution will eventually be to anybody that takes the distribution getting a dilution compared to those that don't. It is to me just more. I mean, for one. Putting in the operating agreement that any, you know, that owners can take money out like. I'm not. I don't. I say this, like, obviously a little bit jokingly, but, like, willy nilly, like, they can just take out up to $12,500. That's a lot of money, right? So I have had issues with my own investment partners where. They're like, this is not your company anymore, even though you own it. For me, like, I own 80% of my company, they're like, it's not just your company anymore. You can't just take out whatever you want when you feel like it. You have to run it by us. It has to be approved, and we might as well, and we very well will say no. So it's not, you know, it's not just something that, like, that we. That think can be done. Easily. And I don't think it's language that is going to be. I mean, not that Carlos and Mike are going to maybe Carlos Alaska for the operating agreement, maybe he won't. But, like, you know, if that's in there, it's going to be an issue for investors.

### You (2025-09-16T15:43:15.612Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:43:16.172Z)

When they do, when they get to the point where they're asking for the operating agreement. The loan backup that what I suggested today and it originally was that it be a payroll W2. Because that's obviously like the most normal. I say normal not for startups, but, you know, in general, it's been most normal way to get paid. By attorney pointed out that that's going to be a administrative nightmare because we'd have to get set up to pay. Like, we'd have to be a registered employer in every state. Where we do payroll, we'd have to pay payroll taxes in every state. You know, like a lot more taxes to file, stuff like that. Possibly healthcare if we get. If we do any payable in California. And it feels like. Which I think we could do it. And we will eventually do it. I am 100% sure. Like, we will do payroll, probably sooner rather than later. Because that's, again, the most. I think like sensible way for everybody to get paid that wants to get paid, even though it is more difficult. But we need to CFO and some other things too. Before we do that? Because, I don't know. I'm not, like. I can try, but I'm not an expert. So the loan is like the was the way that my attorney recommended. It's like, the easiest. It doesn't have to go into the operating agreement because it can be done outside of the operating agreement. And it works. The end result is the same as the distributions and the withholding that Diane was talking about. Like somebody that takes a loan and it doesn't have to be everybody, like you want it one or more if you can take a loan. And it doesn't matter to everybody else because it's completely separate outside the operating agreement. It's not a distribution.

### You (2025-09-16T15:44:51.852Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:44:51.932Z)

Even though it would. You get the company. When we have bank account set up and there's money in it, the company would send money to the founder. So it would function the same way in that sense, but we would call it a loan, and there would be, like, an agreement that goes along with it. Separate. A separate agreement outside of the operating agreement. And that agreement would say, like, you know, this founder is going to take a loan of X amount or X amount per month for the next X amount of months. It'll, you know, there'll be interest on it, but it'll be very, like, de minimis, like a 1% or something like that. And it can be paid back at any schedule, any point in time, whatever. Like how I. And we can. The terms can be extraordinarily flexible, obviously. And if the founder can't or the. I guess like, there, the options to pay it back could be paying it back with owner distributions. If we at some point got a big raise and we're all like, fuck it, let's all take a bonus. I'll take 20 grand or whatever. Like, it could be paid back from that.

### You (2025-09-16T15:45:50.812Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:45:53.932Z)

It could be paid back from payroll when that is set up. Or it could be paid back from, like, from equity, Right? Which would be basically, like. Like, however much money. You know, somebody took $50,000 loan, we would basically, like their percentage interest in the company would be reduced by that, that amount. And it would go. I guess that amount would go back to. The. I don't know where we. I used to go into the. Like, it would go into the options pool, I guess. But how did I find out more about how that works? Because I. As I was thinking about it earlier, We have to. I think that requires evaluation. So. Maybe so, but I think if that's the case, we can just say it's 5 million. In which case anybody could get. You know, $50,000 for, like, you know, 1% or something like that, right?

### You (2025-09-16T15:46:51.772Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:46:52.652Z)

So it's a pretty good exchange rate, like, as far as, like, you know, being able to draw money out of the company. But it's done outside of the operating agreement. It's not. I think it's much more like that, which makes the whole thing more. Something we could pass by investors. And frankly pass by Mark.

### You (2025-09-16T15:47:21.132Z)

That makes that all make sense.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:47:23.932Z)

So I wanted to get your thoughts on all of that before. I explained it in more to to Diane.

### You (2025-09-16T15:47:32.732Z)

Yeah. No, I mean, it sounds. I. I don't have any issues with it. You know, I just wasn't quite clear on the equity part, so I. I understand it now. So, you know, when I, when, when I was thinking equity in my reply to Diane, I was thinking, you know, more along the owner, distribution portion of the equity. So, yeah, if you take a hundred thousand dollars loan, we declare $125,000. Payout or bonus to the five founders. And Diane or whoever took out the $100,000 loan would only get 25,000 or maybe 23,000 after interest, right? That's the way I was looking at it. But I. I didn't really consider the fact that you could give up equity shares. For that. Simply because of what you said. You. You have to have a valuation at that point. In order to determine the value. What is a share worth?

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:48:42.252Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:48:42.492Z)

And so I own $100,000. Does that, you know, how many shares does that equal? But the way you explained it makes sense, so I'm. I'm fine.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:48:52.412Z)

Okay. I'm ask my attorney about that piece about, you know, how much does the cause. I agree. You have to have a. In order to exchange, you know, shares to pay back the loan, you have to have a valuation. So. Alaska. But again, if it's done outside the operating agreement, then I don't think it matters. Right. Like, we could say whatever we want. As long as we agree amongst ourselves, we're not gonna run into the headache that you often run into with that sort of. That spread between investor and founder which makes valuation so difficult.

### You (2025-09-16T15:49:23.692Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:49:30.972Z)

I think that. Is easier up front. I mean, Diane did say she doesn't want to impact her equity, which I completely understand. However, I think what I was trying to say in my email. Or maybe I didn't actually send an email. Maybe I was just thinking it is. It's gonna happen anyway. If she takes the distribution and the rest of us don't, the rest of us will end up with more equity because it'll die with.

### You (2025-09-16T15:49:52.972Z)

Right. Well, see, now that. That's another question that I had, though. It's like.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:49:53.052Z)

If we cannot.

### You (2025-09-16T15:49:58.492Z)

Okay, let's just say we approve a $10,000 distribution. For each of us. And if anybody doesn't want the distribution, when I read through the. The llc. It sounded to me like. It's almost like the money would just be escrowed.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:50:19.852Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-16T15:50:21.772Z)

And earn interest. And that it. It wouldn't really affect your equity. You're not. You're not giving up anything. You're just deferring, getting that money. So that when you decide that you do want it, You get the check for $10,000 plus accrued interest.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:50:45.772Z)

Well, let me go look. I thought it said in there you could defer and then it could convert after a certain amount of time.

### You (2025-09-16T15:50:58.972Z)

Yeah, maybe I. Maybe I misread that. Or maybe I missed it. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:51:05.212Z)

I'll look here. Compensation defer Owner draws. Yeah. Conversion of deferred pay to economic equity options.

### You (2025-09-16T15:51:32.652Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:51:37.532Z)

Which I mean, again. This would probably happen. Or could. Right? So, like, it's gonna be dilutive anyway.

### You (2025-09-16T15:51:43.132Z)

Yeah. Y.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:51:47.852Z)

Maybe not dilutive. I guess it depends on how these get. How the. I guess the converted. Equity would get paid from the options pool, not the. So maybe it's not quite the same, but.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:05.052Z)

Eah, that's. That's how I read that. Does it. You mentioned the option grants, so we're going to have to have an ESOP employee stack option plan.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:11.532Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:14.252Z)

When we start making full time hires.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:14.252Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:17.612Z)

And my reading of. Part C was that we all would still have 20%.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:26.972Z)

Well, not 20%, but we'll have, like, because, I mean.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:31.452Z)

We'll have 20% of the founder's equity. No, I understand that when we start bringing in money,

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:34.092Z)

Yes, yes, yes.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:38.412Z)

You know, we still have 20%, but 20% of the smaller slice of the pie. So I was thinking that in this situation, in part C, those options would be coming from, like, the employee stock option pool.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:54.892Z)

That's probably true. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:52:55.212Z)

Not. Okay, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:52:56.812Z)

Yeah. So it's. It's right. It's not going to be dilutive.

### You (2025-09-16T15:53:01.212Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:53:04.492Z)

In that sense, anyway.

### You (2025-09-16T15:53:08.092Z)

And I don't want to get hung up on these. I mean, they're probably outlier situations. You know, maybe somebody's gonna want. To take a loan or in advance, others probably would want to defer it. You know, I. I don't. I don't want to get the full amount each month. I want.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:53:31.052Z)

It can be. Yeah. And. And.

### You (2025-09-16T15:53:32.812Z)

You know, Because I know she's got, like, 8,500amonth. It's like, I don't. I don't need that much right now. I would rather defer some of it.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:53:40.252Z)

Yeah. The loan is easier.

### You (2025-09-16T15:53:43.852Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:53:44.732Z)

Because it doesn't require, like. I mean, I think it doesn't require as much. Administrative work because it just requires one loan to one. It's a one off versus.

### You (2025-09-16T15:53:55.372Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:01.372Z)

These owner distributions. Every time one happens, we'll have to track who doesn't take it, how much they don't take, what's the interest on that? You'll have to have basically five amortization tables. And cash flows, like, much more difficult than just having one. Like, if Diane has one, you know you have one. Node has one.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:21.772Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:22.572Z)

And they only last as long as they're only in place as long as it's needed until we get payroll set up.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:27.932Z)

Yeah, right, right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:30.092Z)

Which and just.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:31.612Z)

Same thing, though. You have to have money alone. So that's assuming that we have funds in excess of our operating expenses.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:34.492Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:42.892Z)

From whatever we've managed to raise.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:46.732Z)

Well, that's. Yeah, that gets me to this thing here. If you did you look over this.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:51.052Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:52.092Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T15:54:53.612Z)

There's been so many versions going around, but it familiar.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:54:55.772Z)

Sorry. This is the one I sent last night, I believe, just to you and Diane. I wanted to get. So it's roughly the same numbers that you guys had in your budget. I think I need to.

### You (2025-09-16T15:55:06.412Z)

I must have missed that. I better go back my email and look, I saw the attachment for the safe note that you sent, but maybe I missed this one.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:55:09.852Z)

Okay? Maybe I forgot to attach it. So here's money in. Raised fundraise or revenue. Money out. Cost. Right. And I need to tweak these, maybe break it up a little bit more to put in the option, you know, this offshore engineer product, whatever. But it's by month. I reduced some things that I just don't think. I need to probably. Well, again, I better account for the payroll that Diane Minod and you are considering that might be put somewhere else, but anyway. Point being that, you know, this is, I think, a framework or a format we can use to talk about, you know, what's our burn rate Howard, you know, 5,000, 12,000, 17,000. You know, like, how much are we spending per month? And what is that total amount? That we have spent. And how does that compare to what we've raised? I mean, Diane, to her credit, has done, I think, a good job. Like, she's raised a good amount of money. I mean, that's like, if we need. At this point, it's. I. I think it's more like two. Hundred to 250,000. For the next six months. I think Diane said It was like 500. But that's what we can talk about it in this.

### You (2025-09-16T15:56:34.892Z)

Yeah, you know what? That's the problem that we have with sending these as attachments instead of just sharing a single source of truth. Her document that she sent basically had a typo. And. And it kind of showed that we needed $250,000 by January. And then $500,000 by March. But really, the. The 250,000 was through the end of March. So Q1 of 2026. And then from Q2 through Q4, we would need another 250. So that 500 actually takes us through December of 2026.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:57:22.092Z)

Okay, well, that's. That's. That makes more sense to me. I didn't actually look at the totals. I was just looking at each row and putting. Translating that into this.

### You (2025-09-16T15:57:28.572Z)

Yeah. No, it was actually in her header road. The way that she had the months explaining. She had, like, January, February for one, and then March for the oven.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:57:40.812Z)

Oh, I see. Yay. Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T15:57:42.012Z)

It looked like we needed $250,000. During January, February, and March of 2026. So, yeah, it was just the way the headers were laid out, so I made a correction to that, but I don't know if that made it through to the final.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:57:56.572Z)

Got it. Well, yeah, I agree. We can put this on. On onenote, on teams, but somewhere where it's shared and I'll. I'll stop doing it on a. On a. Micro drive. But the. So the second part of that. Product roadmap timeline and budget are not directly linked it seems like in any way.

### You (2025-09-16T15:58:24.572Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:58:24.732Z)

Other than the passage of time.

### You (2025-09-16T15:58:26.892Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:58:29.132Z)

But that is obviously critical cause our burn rate, you know, how much can we get done, you know, for each month that we have money? And, you know, if we need more time, then we need more money. And how much are we gonna get done for that? You know, that time and money. I want to. And I struggle, honestly with this within my own business. I haven't even, like, got something like this at all. So this has been a learning experience for me. But I want to be able to have those conversations, you know, kind of side by side, in a way. Even though they're not, again, directly related other than the time dimension. So does this framework here make sense? Or is this, like, not helpful? Or not. Maybe not. Not helpful. But is this, like, not a way that it makes sense for you and Beno to talk about things? You know, maybe V1 and V2. Maybe MVP and V1 broken apart like this doesn't make sense. Maybe this could get moved up here.

### You (2025-09-16T15:59:22.732Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, this kind of goes back to our conversation where there is no clean cut off.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:59:28.012Z)

And maybe.

### You (2025-09-16T15:59:32.812Z)

Between MVP and V1 or anything else, and how we allocate expenses to each. You know the thing.

### Guest (2025-09-16T15:59:43.052Z)

Well, other than again, don't think expenses. There's no this, this here. We are not talking about expenses in this product. Right. The expenses are just layered on top because they, they happen by month. That's the only reason they're here. So they can. We can see what we're developing and how. Much we're spending, but there is no direct relationship between the two.

### You (2025-09-16T15:59:52.332Z)

Yeah. Ok? Ay. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:00:04.812Z)

So, yeah. And I agree that there's no.

### You (2025-09-16T16:00:07.932Z)

Development progress, then, yeah, this is fine.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:00:13.692Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-16T16:00:14.812Z)

Because there will be a point in time where while we're testing the MVP and making tweaks to it, The three developers are going to start working on features in version 1. So you. You know, you're not gonna see 100% across every single row.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:00:32.412Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T16:00:38.332Z)

In the MVP before you start seeing progress in here, but we could then, you know, for example, if they start working on something. Yeah, we probably need to go through the version one and make sure that we've got it. Looks like you just repeated the same items in the mvp, but in version one there will be new features new things that we have to add. But either way, Either way, you're gonna see, you know, maybe 10 or 20% on a particular row in version one, while there's still maybe 40% in something in the MVP, right? Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:01:15.132Z)

Yeah. And I agree that they're all there's work is not gonna be from a development perspective doesn't cut along these lines.

### You (2025-09-16T16:01:20.412Z)

Yeah, it's not been here.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:01:22.412Z)

But. Yeah, but from a product launch perspective, You know, there is a clearer, right? There is a point at which we say we have enough done of the MVP that we can take it to market.

### You (2025-09-16T16:01:34.012Z)

Yes. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:01:36.732Z)

You know, to our small and Polish small market and then broaden that up. Okay? And. I guess just. I'll send you this again. But think about whether this. These are the right things for us, you know. Us. You and Mino to talk about. And. I know that we've talked a lot about what, like, the AI features are, what reporting is about. Like, all these things are. However, I think it. 's still. I mean. It would be good to somehow. I would like to create more clarity. Maybe it's just a matter of putting the specific thing in the notes. Like what is infrastructure in mvp? What is data model in mvp? What is pipeline? What is document scraping?

### You (2025-09-16T16:02:31.292Z)

Yeah, we could do something like that.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:02:33.292Z)

Just that way. It's, like, very easy to set for, particularly for Mark. Right. Because I know he's going to want to. Ask those questions. And even again to me and Diane. Right. Like, what. What exactly is it we're talking about in this, you know, step here?

### You (2025-09-16T16:02:48.572Z)

Yeah. Ok. Yeah, no, we could. We could do something like that, no problem.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:02:53.372Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And again, it's not. The budget piece is. Is not in any way related to the product map other than to say that this is the money we're spending as we do this work. There's no direct relationship.

### You (2025-09-16T16:03:06.172Z)

Right. Okay. All right. Yeah. Now, that makes. That makes sense. That's just a progress timeline, which is. Which is fine.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:03:13.452Z)

Yeah y.

### You (2025-09-16T16:03:14.892Z)

And once we get everybody established, whether it's JIRA or something else, that's something that could be tracked more accurately and that we can just export.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:03:27.132Z)

Eah. I think this is. This is just like, for the first, you know, like that we do this while we're getting things, you know, once we get more established, then each, each of us will probably fall into our dedicated tools and work from that.

### You (2025-09-16T16:03:48.892Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:03:50.012Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-16T16:03:50.892Z)

All right. I also replied back with some comments on the pitch. Deck word document.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:03:59.852Z)

Yeah, I saw that.

### You (2025-09-16T16:04:00.732Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:04:02.092Z)

Didn't look at it yet, but thank you. My spelling is atrocious as my grammar.

### You (2025-09-16T16:04:04.892Z)

Well, it's. No, I mean, it really wasn't any spelling. It was just. And I tend to be very anal about grammar and spelling, so I hope I don't offend anybody. But, you know, when, when we're looking at external doc, if it was an internal doc, I wouldn't give a. Shit. But, you know, being external, I'm a little bit picky. But I also did have some changes to the roadmap. Nothing. Nothing, major. Just kind of a clarification. On the, like, two or three different things.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:04:38.652Z)

Okay? Yeah. And I think that the product roadmap. Continue to, like, what exactly goes into this? How does this get? Like, I want to put something in here. It's obviously gonna be higher level, but, like, what is it? What is like, you know, Carlos, this guy from Drift. What's he gonna want to see what's use this Might not be enough.

### You (2025-09-16T16:05:07.052Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:05:08.012Z)

So maybe it's a little bit more like the actual we talked about, you know, Davis, great documents, great thing or something, I don't know.

### You (2025-09-16T16:05:15.372Z)

Yeah. I think my suggestion on that would be to keep it high level, just like this. I kind of like the layout. I mean, I don't have any issues with that. But if somebody asks what's going into the MVP or, you know, how are we conducting the testing? And, you know, things like that, you know, maybe that would just be a follow up item.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:05:38.892Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-16T16:05:39.292Z)

You know, don't. Don't assume that they want all that detail. Let make a mask. You know, I feel.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:05:44.172Z)

Yeah. One of my business partners is a big proponent of that. Is like, give less if they want more, make a mask.

### You (2025-09-16T16:05:51.292Z)

Y.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:05:53.532Z)

Okay, cool. Well, thank you for looking this over, and I will. And I want to talk. We can talk about it later today. I want to talk about it from the context of. And I think I said this before, we should start with this, thinking of it as our business plan. Right. Like, this is our mission statement. This is our, you know, the problems we're seeking to tackle. This is the solution we are creating.

### You (2025-09-16T16:06:09.612Z)

Es. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:06:18.732Z)

These are some of the key features.

### You (2025-09-16T16:06:21.212Z)

Yeah, I like. I think that was very good.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:06:21.852Z)

These are. These target audience. These are the data sources and our roles. I guess we could even. I could actually even add our rules in here, but that way, it's gonna be in the pitch deck. This way, too. But it's really more of like, make sure we agree on everything, because I didn't do that in my first business, and it's still fucking haunting us.

### You (2025-09-16T16:06:39.292Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:06:43.212Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-09-16T16:06:43.932Z)

Yeah, I think, you know, here we are six, seven months in, and we've never really. Looked at that. I mean, that should have been done in March, in my opinion.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:06:55.532Z)

Yeah, no, I know. And it seems, like, so obvious, and that's why I didn't do it the first time either, because it's, like, so obvious.

### You (2025-09-16T16:06:59.212Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:07:01.132Z)

But. Different people. It means different things, different people. Invariably.

### You (2025-09-16T16:07:10.732Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:07:11.772Z)

Cool. Well, let me send you this Excel document just again, look it over, think about it. Maybe talk with the note. Or if you guys want, three of us want to talk about, you know, how we talk about the product. Again, just internally, for our weekly calls. It won't be forever, but just for the time being while we're getting things.

### You (2025-09-16T16:07:25.452Z)

Right. Yeah, no, makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:07:30.412Z)

Stabilized.

### You (2025-09-16T16:07:30.732Z)

Cool. Appreciate your help.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:07:32.812Z)

Alrighty. Thanks a lot.

### You (2025-09-16T16:07:33.532Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-16T16:07:33.612Z)

Howard.

### You (2025-09-16T16:07:34.012Z)

See? Ya.
