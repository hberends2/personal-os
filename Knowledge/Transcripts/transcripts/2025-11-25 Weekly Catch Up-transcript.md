# Transcript for: Weekly Catch Up

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:01:58.099Z)

Hey.

### You (2025-11-25T15:01:58.819Z)

Good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:01:59.059Z)

Happy Tuesday. Good. Do you want me to not record this or record it? Do you have a preference?

### You (2025-11-25T15:02:07.139Z)

Makes no difference to me.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:02:08.419Z)

Okay? How are you feeling? Are you feeling any better?

### You (2025-11-25T15:02:15.539Z)

Yeah. Yeah, doing all right. Kind of a crazy weekend. And yesterday my daughter's car breaks gave out. She's okay, but you know Father, who wants to fix everything, so I.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:02:31.779Z)

Yeah. No, the pressure.

### You (2025-11-25T15:02:36.579Z)

Spent pretty much all day. Sunday. No Saturday. Trying to fix her breaks. And, of course, everything is way more difficult than it needs to be. Then I got down to the part where I had to replace a part that. Nobody carries. You have to get from a Honda dealer. And of course, they don't have it in stock. They have to get it from Honda itself. And so. Her car sat there on inner driveway. And then finally I found a brake shop that could get it in. And they can. They can make the part that's necessary, don't have to order it. So ended up going over there yesterday. Having it towed to the place, and I had to drive over there. It's like I didn't get anything done over the weekend on anything. It was just like, all dealing with that, so it was crazy.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:03:44.419Z)

Well, she's lucky to have a dad that cares so much, right? Not all people have dads that will help that much.

### You (2025-11-25T15:03:51.619Z)

No, but I think, yeah, at this point it's fine. But I think, yeah, when she was younger, I didn't do her any help. By always being the dad that comes to the rescue. You know, at some point, you know, she has to be self sufficient and it's, she's doing much better now, but for a few years there, we had some real issues that we had to work through with her. So.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:04:21.619Z)

It's hard, right? Being a parent today, it's almost like we over parent. Like we, you know, it's like this. Our Berends weren't like that. I was listening to someone talk. That's a Gen X mom, right? And she was talking. She's like, my mom didn't even know. What colleges I was applying to. You know what I mean? And that's like. It was just a very different generation, our Berends compared to how we are parenting our kids.

### You (2025-11-25T15:04:43.379Z)

Rry. Different world.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:04:47.779Z)

Different world. So where should we start? Do you have a preference? Any particular place?

### You (2025-11-25T15:04:56.019Z)

No, no, but just, you know, I need to get some stuff done before our brainstorming call. I thought our call was at one and I just. When I logged in here, I see it's 11:00, so.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:05:11.139Z)

Keep it short.

### You (2025-11-25T15:05:12.179Z)

Yeah, let's. Let's. Let's just kind of hit the highlights of if there's anything. I do not really have anything new. I did put the documentation together for the lender. Model. So the developers, they haven't received it yet. Drew and Vinod are still reviewing it. But it's. It's 99% done. So hopefully they can start putting that together. So that'll be the modal that I demonstrated that's got all the different inputs. The five KPI cards, switched out those to be more lenders specific. And I really think that's pretty much all of it. There will need to be some paid differences made to the valuation page that are not applicable to the lender. So we'll make some changes there, but they've got enough to get started.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:06:10.819Z)

Okay? Okay, then flipping to the call with Mark, because. Mark Woodworth, because that's at 11.

### You (2025-11-25T15:06:13.219Z)

On. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:06:18.419Z)

I think. So the main things, like when we demo our product, like, I think I don't even know where to go with this, but. When we talk about the work we've done with InnVestAI, trying to show that we've replicated an Excel model and that we are like that people will see and SaaS and be like, oh, this is exactly like the Excel model I use. Right? And the fact that we're having over 90% success rate with the data extraction. Those are probably the two biggest things to stress. Does that make sense for. For them, it's like, yes, we have painstakingly taken an Excel model and rebuilt that exact look and feel in software.

### You (2025-11-25T15:06:56.739Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:07:06.659Z)

And yes, it is going to take people time to let go of Excel. That's not going to happen immediately. Right. Because Jeremy gets really caught up in the Excel piece of it. And so I don't want to get stuck with him not being able to get off in his mind that, you know, Excel it is we rebuilt the Excel model exactly, almost the best we can. So it's replicated in SAS and we're having fantastic success rate. Not perfect, not where we potentially need to be, but on the data extraction.

### You (2025-11-25T15:07:34.899Z)

Y. Es. Yes. Yes. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:07:40.579Z)

The second thing is Mark, he, like if I described in the emails, he's the grandfather of these two data products that CBRE has shut down. He has a long history of how he came to this decision to create these. It was with Torto Weeden. Right. And all of this. Jack Cordial is an economist. That he worked with at pk. At pkf, Jack Cordial is very much in a retirement stage. He's in his early mid-70s. Right. But he's still a fantastic, bright economist. And he could recreate Horizons and the model they created when they were at pkf, as Jeremy described it, it's like a Z estimate, right? And we're more like a red iq. But I have been thinking, especially since the work you've been doing with AI that you've been telling me about in the background. Right. That both can coexist. That doesn't need to be like one or the other. And I say that because Jack is very focused. He's only going to work on and want to work on the AV piece of it, right? The estimate, like with the econometric forecast. And that will get Jack excited, which will get Mark more enthusiastic about things. And another thing, just so you know. Well, I don't think we need it for this call with Mark. But Jack is very, very old school, and he does not like pushy women. So whenever we present this to Jack, I'm going to have to take a backseat. Right. And you're probably going to have to take a front seat to it because he just doesn't respond. That's just his generation. He doesn't respond very well to people like me. I proposed to Mark, and I don't know if this will fly for him or not, but because I know I sent a lot in writing that we essentially partner with him. It be a revenue split so that he can start right? Then we would work through what that is. But that means earlier monetization opportunity for them, right?

### You (2025-11-25T15:09:50.979Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:09:52.099Z)

That they engage a gentleman named Robert Mandelbaum, who used to work for pkf. I mean, he's. They're all part of the same crew. He's leaving CBRE at the end of the year. He's also, like, probably in his 70s, I might imagine, but Robert has the personal relationship. With those hundred management companies that are sending the data right? And that Mark, Robert and I between Mark, Woodworth, Robert and I, between the three of us, figure out a way to do outreach to each management company. In December, maybe early January. And we just asked them, don't shut off the data, just send it to a different place.

### You (2025-11-25T15:10:29.139Z)

Yes. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:10:31.779Z)

Then we put our heads down between now and the big hotel conference that's the first week of June, and just work through. If we could get 8,000 hotels their data and we could just figure out how to get it processed right, it would put us in a completely different position to launch InnVestAI. I suggested to Mark that we split the software engineering costs and the aws, the data, the hosting of the data. I told him what our actual software engineering costs were, what they would be budgeted to go to. They probably go higher than that, right? If we actually did something like this with him. But that's the concept. Can we. Split the cost of the software engineering team and the hosting and things like that. And then I asked if Mark would be interested in investing in InnVestAI but obviously he would never see a dollar of that for a very, very long time. It may be more generational to his sons that are in the business. I hope you don't mind that I did all of that. I realized I'm taking. I'm going like rogue and doing this.

### You (2025-11-25T15:11:38.179Z)

Not at all.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:11:42.819Z)

But, I mean, if we can make this happen, it would be really great for InnVestAI. So have I overstepped? Are you okay? I mean, what's your. What's your reaction?

### You (2025-11-25T15:11:54.739Z)

I'm totally fine with it. So I guess my question is and it doesn't have to be answered as. Hour. Mark Andrew fit in. This is assuming that we do not.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:12:07.859Z)

They do not continue. Right. I can't execute an LLC with more. He accused me of fraud. I don't, I mean, that devastated me. Last week, I literally, like, like, I think I was in shock. Tuesday, I cried. Wednesday, I, like, and I have other things I've done a lot. Like, I talked to Sherbin over the weekend. He'd still be willing to invest. It comes with strings.

### You (2025-11-25T15:12:27.619Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:12:31.779Z)

Which we don't have time to talk about right now. But you and Vinod and I would just need to sit down with Sherben and here's proposal and the three of us decide if we're. If it's worth the strings, right? That come with it. But what his money could do. Would allow us to pay back Drew and Payback Mark anything. He's come out of pocket so that we would not owe them anything, like any money.

### You (2025-11-25T15:12:53.299Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:12:54.579Z)

He would want a percentage of the company. He is an attorney, right? Which having like almost like a fractional GC could be very helpful to us. But he wants a big piece of the company for this. And I'm just not like he'd be willing 50 or 60k. He thinks we should try to settle with Mark Andrew and, like, pay them 25k each. I'm personally not okay with that at this point, but that's. And he. Well, there's some other things it would be just worth. Like, I don't want to leave. Like, this needs to be the three of us talking with him about. This if this is something you guys want to entertain. But I helped me understand on this call today. Am I going to be asked to exit the venture. Because I'm a little worried I'm going to get on a call at 5:30 and the four of you are going to say we want you out.

### You (2025-11-25T15:12:56.819Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah. Okay? I believe it's just it. It'll probably come down to. They're gonna. They're just gonna say, this is the llc. Either sign it or don't. I don't think anybody's gonna say you're out or anything like that, which, I mean, it's irrelevant if they do or not. So that's really been the only discussion is just getting the LLC signed. That's it. When you say Mark accused you of fraud, did that come from Mark, or was that from the email that I sent you?

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:14:23.459Z)

From the email you sent me.

### You (2025-11-25T15:14:24.659Z)

Okay, that.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:14:25.619Z)

Because you copied that from something. Because I could see the edit where it was. I know this is harsh, but this is. And then you. I could see the edit. Could be construed as. So I know you copied it from something that you. I. At least I assume that.

### You (2025-11-25T15:14:42.659Z)

It did not come from Archei. It was. It was copied into the. The chat from an email that I sent Mark. And actually, nobody accused you of fraud. And that's why I want to make sure that it's. That I. I don't remember if I use the word construed or perceived. But from.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:15:03.379Z)

You use the word is. And then there was. Because it was so start. I'm sorry, I don't. I. But please continue. I'm over talking.

### You (2025-11-25T15:15:10.819Z)

Right. Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:15:11.619Z)

In.

### You (2025-11-25T15:15:13.299Z)

That's why. That's. That's where the edit came in. Because I realized that it was not worded properly, and I went in and changed it to either construed or perceived. Nobody. Nobody. Mark myself is accusing you of fraud. But if you take a look at it, if somebody from the outside looked at the chain of events, somebody could perceive it as potential fraud. I guess I should have clarified that I was so. I apologize. For the way that was. Put forth. Because it was definitely never intended to say you committed fraud. It was.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:15:54.259Z)

That's what it read. That's how I read it.

### You (2025-11-25T15:15:57.379Z)

And. And if. And if somebody sent that to me, that would have. I would have done the same thing. I would have flipped out. That's why I went back and tried to. Revise it to say that it could be construed as or perceived as whichever word I used. And, yeah, I probably should even take it further and said from maybe from an outside observer, Or something like that, but that was the intent. So I wanted to clarify that, because if we do get on a call, I don't want you to say something. Well, Mark, you accuse me of fraud or something like that when it did not come from Mark's lips, so.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:16:28.579Z)

Okay, that's good. Right. Okay. The word harsh is. The only person that uses that word is usually Mark. I felt like it was Mark's language to me, because he's usually the one that says, I know this is harsh. I know this is harsh. So what?

### You (2025-11-25T15:16:46.419Z)

Maybe. Maybe that got stuck in my mind. Maybe I heard. Maybe I heard him say that. But no, that. That was. That was all from me.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:16:47.939Z)

Do we? Okay. What about, though? I just can't, like. I hope you understand. I don't feel Mark has contributed to this company, and I feel like he's holding things over my head and he's not collaborating. In a way, I need him to collaborate. That's just genuinely how I feel.

### You (2025-11-25T15:17:07.459Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:17:13.859Z)

I feel the fact that they have tried to push me out. Makes me not try. I just completely not trust them and not want to do business with them. And I've not wanted to do business with Mark. For. I mean, it's come to. Come to pass. Sherburne described it this way to me was probably. I mean, after a three hour conversation, That my head wanted to explode. But he said, the good thing, Diane, that has come from this is the detail that was put forth in the LLC has surfaced issues among the five of you that needed to be resolved. And if they're unresolvable, then it's better to know that now than later.

### You (2025-11-25T15:17:55.619Z)

Yeah. No, that's absolutely true.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:17:56.979Z)

On. Right. And so I feel like I can't do business with Mark. And I just. Drew breaks my heart. But if he feels that same way as Mark does, then I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I can trust him either. If they literally reached out to you and said they want to. I mean, what. What are the words even they want to make? Continue to allow me to be an economic partner but not be part of the business, not be part of the business decisions.

### You (2025-11-25T15:18:28.099Z)

Yeah, that was basically at the. That you would retain your equity but not be a. A voting founder is the way that they phrased it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:18:37.859Z)

I mean, I just. I'm so blown by that. I don't. They don't even have the next, like, set of vision of, like, how to go about the capex and the legal and the clip, right, So. I've just kind of had. I mean, I don't. I clearly. I will not sign an LLC with Mark. I'm just sorry if that puts us at risk. I'm so sorry if that puts Vinode at risk. I really am sorry. But. And Drew, I feel like I just can't trust him at this point.

### You (2025-11-25T15:19:05.699Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:19:08.099Z)

So.

### You (2025-11-25T15:19:08.659Z)

And Oda and I immediately after that call.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:19:09.139Z)

We're.

### You (2025-11-25T15:19:13.059Z)

You know, we both agreed that. No, we're not gonna. We're not gonna do anything like that, so. That's a non issue with us. I'm actually kind of excited, and hopefully, you know. Yeah. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I think it could get ugly, but I think in the long run, it's the right thing to do.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:19:36.659Z)

Too many cooks in the kitchen. Right? Vinod says that. Right. And. And they're not collaborating with me. Like, I need collaborators. They're just taking over. And I feel like my. I tried, Howard. Like, I'm trying to be like, we're all leaders, right? And I feel like we. I want us to. Create a company that the people are so good, you have no idea who the leader is. Right. Like, that's what I want for InnVestAI And so what's happening? And so I have been trying to collect, like, oh, like, okay, if it's perceived that I don't have certain skills and Drew does. Let him take this area. But as a result, they've taken advantage of me, I feel like. And they've just taken over certain things, and that's not okay with me. I feel like that's. That's. That's just not okay with me.

### You (2025-11-25T15:20:05.139Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No. No. No, we're. We are on the same page. Definitely. Vinod and I are right there with you. I've always felt, regardless, that this is your. It's. It's your company. You're the CEO who I. I don't give a.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:20:50.339Z)

It's our company. It's right. It's like.

### You (2025-11-25T15:20:52.579Z)

Yeah, yeah, but like I'm saying, I. I don't care about the equity. If we all have equal equity. I mean, this is something you've been working on for many, many years. And for somebody else like Mark and Do to come in here and, like, even suggest that you would not be a voting member, I thought was basically way out of line. So that's just. That's just my point of view. What was I gonna. There was something else I was gonna. Oh. The email that I sent this morning, it's the. The subject matter was just please read this. And it's a link to an article. I sent it to everybody, but it was for Mark. And it's about how. A large number of startups fail because they try to hard to get the perfect product out.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:21:52.179Z)

Product, right? Yes.

### You (2025-11-25T15:21:54.019Z)

And it had tons data in. It has some very famous people that. Talk about that. And, I mean, it was really directed directly at Mark. And that I think, as much as anything is going to cause us to fail, If. He refuses to attempt to raise funds until we have the perfect product. That's. That's. Gonna. I mean, there's no way we can succeed that way, so.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:22:29.299Z)

Right. And he's. He has really hurt my ability to raise funds over the last quarter by refusing. And they have. They just won't finish the pitch deck. Right. Or they won't. And I've tried. But anyway, so give me advice like the way I see tonight. I show up, I listen. I don't know if it's just going to be like, we've finalized the llc, Diane, sign it. Or if they're going to walk through. If you guys are going to walk through the points that you guys have negotiated and, like, determined, how do you think it's going to play out tonight? At 5:30.

### You (2025-11-25T15:23:10.099Z)

I think Drew is going to. Basically. Say that we. That. That. The changes you had requested were made. Which I don't know if it's true or not. I did not go through each of those things. I'm not going to go through a history of emails to see if everything was changed to what you had requested. So he's. He's probably going to say, you know, that there's no reason not to sign it. Because we did everything you asked. So you might want to spend some time to see if the revised sections actually do meet your requirements. If they do, I don't know how you would say, you know, I'm not going to execute the llc. It's going to basically come down to I'm not going to work with Mark. So saying I'm not going to sign the LLC is probably the easiest way out. But if that available, then it's going to have to say, well, you know, why I, you know, if, if the LLC meets your conditions, why else would you not sign it? And it's going to have to come down to.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:24:18.739Z)

Well, I, I.

### You (2025-11-25T15:24:29.699Z)

I'm not sure how you would put it, but.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:24:32.979Z)

Feel like, in good faith, because I am just surfacing from, like, a week of budget meetings and, and, like, and then tomorrow I go back to. And I know everyone gets tired of me talking about, but, like, I have three days of intense physical labor and ahead of me, where I just have to, like, compartmentalize some of this, so. And I will not be able to even look at the LLC agreement until Saturday at the earliest. And I really owe Driftwood today, right, which I'm not giving them, so I need some time to review pllc. I would never sign an LLC just on Drew's proclamation that he has put the things that I want in there. Because that's fair, right? To me, like that, this is like a marriage. I'm not going to just trust him to do this.

### You (2025-11-25T15:25:18.899Z)

No, no, I understand, but. There's been so many comments that. There's. I mean, this has been going on until September. I think if you come up and say, well, I still won't be able to get to it till Saturday, I think the shift's going to hit the fan.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:25:35.539Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:25:36.579Z)

I don't know what else, because we've had, you know, all of this time. To do work on it so that I would not rely on anybody. I mean. We're all frustrated that we are so far behind. And I'm including you. I mean, we expected to have something, you know, at the beginning of September and everything else, and it just keeps getting pushed back. And it's not just because the llc, but I think everybody is at the point now where, you know, let's see their sign it or let's just put a fork in it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:26:15.299Z)

So do I just say then tonight I'm not comfortable. Mark, you and I. I feel like this is created environment. Where do I just to go there? I mean, are you in vinod going to be okay with that? Because that's going to literally cause everything to blow up. I mean, Drew's not going to. They're going to demand repayment of the money. They are going to. I mean, I don't, I, I fear that Mark will threaten litigation. And I have researched Delaware law to understand if he would have a claim. I don't think he would because there's, under Delaware law, you have to have an actual LLC and verbal and email is not indicative of of an agreement. It's assigned LLC.

### You (2025-11-25T15:26:22.099Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So I think. If I was in that position. First off, you don't have to worry about open. Don't I? It's not going to cause any problems because we've already had discussions about plan B. So it's. It's really. Mark andrew. And. And. And, yeah. If we. We can't. Put this on the llc in terms of why more time, right?

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:27:31.459Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:27:33.219Z)

So we either sign the llc tonight. And if we're not ready to do that, Then we have to just say and. And. I would just. You know, I would probably just say I. I cannot go forward with this. And whatever you want to say. But say we. We will work out. Some type of separation.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:27:57.459Z)

A settlement. Separation.

### You (2025-11-25T15:27:59.619Z)

Or something.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:28:01.139Z)

Okay. You guys all right if I go there, right? Because I don't want to like you. Sure. But. No, it's okay.

### You (2025-11-25T15:28:01.219Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:28:06.659Z)

Because it's going to, like, literally. Well, you guys do see that there's money in the bank account, right? I hope I showed you that. So I will put the full 12,500 in next month. I'm going to need something to live on, like some. A couple grand or something along those lines. But it should be enough to continue to pay the software engineers the hosting cost and your tools.

### You (2025-11-25T15:28:29.539Z)

Don't worry about my tools. So I I have not had to use them nearly as much as I did when I was putting together the poc. So the Drew has already drawn a line in the sand saying that he's not going to put anything else on his credit card. And that's for the Amazon. So and we do not have. The staff to pay the $6,000 in December. So as long as we got enough to pay the Amazon bill and the current staff payroll, We're okay.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:29:05.539Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:29:06.179Z)

And I think.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:29:06.499Z)

And I need to work through. Right. Okay. And so what I need to work with you and Vinod is Brax will give us a credit card, but it requires a attached or like another account to have a balance of 2,500, which I can do. I've already attached one of my spare savings accounts, but I. I keep getting scolded. For the commingling of funds and, like, I don't know. Like. So if there's another way for us to work. But we can get a credit card if there's an account that keeps a balance of 2,500, and then we can use that for the Amazon bill.

### You (2025-11-25T15:29:42.099Z)

Yeah, we can do that. And. And I think. I even think Vinod would be able to cover that expense. Temporarily. I mean, if he has to put it on his credit card and then get reimbursed when you get the December deposit or something like that, I'm sure we can. We would be fine with that. So really, I think the way I see it playing out is, you know, We just let them know. This evening that you're not going to continue. And we're not going to have an emotional discussion today. That we can just discuss a settlement later and we could just, like, end the meeting right there, right? Could be a five minute meeting.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:30:30.099Z)

Okay? I just don't want to flip you guys out because. But okay.

### You (2025-11-25T15:30:34.979Z)

We know that I are expecting it.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:30:36.499Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:30:37.379Z)

More people that are going to be flipped out are Drew in Mark and even Drew, because he and I had a. Had a chat going where I just basically told him that. If you didn't sign the llc. I would probably not want to be involved any longer, or I said I would have to reassess whether I was willing to be involved. And he said the same thing. That in terms of. The four of us carrying on without you. I don't think really anybody wanted to do that. So. I, I think we, we would approach it that way. I mean, Vinod was on the, the thread as well, and so, you know, every. The three of us at least were in agreement that if we can't get the LLC signed, we're going to, you know, reassess, which means, yeah, we probably would just. Say we're not going to be involved anymore. You and the note. And I work out the revised llc, the new one. And we just. Come up with a settlement with Mark and Andrew. I would not toss out any numbers. I mean, it's going to be a negotiation just like anything else. So, you know, I would probably say we'll pay back your loan plus the 5% interest. Drew has that in the budget. You can see the numbers in the budget. And then see what they come back at. Of course, I think Mark is going to be the one that's going to throw out all sorts of threats and everything else, but, you know, it's just not something that should be discussed tonight in any way, shape or form.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:32:24.019Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:32:25.219Z)

People are going to be too angry, you know, just. I would just say sometime after Thanksgiving, we'll have some conversation. And see what we can do. Time we continue to move forward. Business as usual with the three of us.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:32:46.339Z)

Sherman's available Wednesday if we want to talk, but I'm at Kroger all day, so I don't. I just. Like, again, it's Thanksgiving, and if you could just imagine, grocery store Thanksgiving. I feel like I'm on, like, super scan, you know? Like, I literally collapse when I leave, so. I think I'll be brain dead. But I could see if. If you guys want to talk on Saturday with Sherben, I could see if he's available, but you guys might not want to do that on a Saturday, on Thanksgiving weekend.

### You (2025-11-25T15:32:55.459Z)

Yeah. We've got a family get together down at her sister's on Saturday, so I would say no, let's just not have any conversations until after the holiday.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:33:16.339Z)

Yeah. Okay? Okay? And you guys feel okay? I mean, you guys don't own the IP I've got, obviously. I established the LLC and the Ein and the Godaddy domain, and so we're. You guys feel like between the three of us, we're protected, right?

### You (2025-11-25T15:33:43.459Z)

I think so.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:33:45.939Z)

And do you fear Mark will retaliate with, like, bad, like, you know, reputational damage, like saying bad things about, particularly me in the industry?

### You (2025-11-25T15:33:58.179Z)

I have no idea.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:33:59.619Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:34:00.339Z)

I would hope that these more mature than that, but I don't know. I don't know them at all, really.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:34:06.419Z)

Okay? All right, then that's what I will do at the. I'm just going to it's going to be a very short call. I'm just going to say that I feel the. Items in the LLC have surfaced issues among the five of us, and that Mark and Drew and I are having, you know, challenges working together, and I'm not prepared to sign the LLC moving forward. And we'll reassess after. You know, this will be a short call. We'll reassess a separation agreement after Thanksgiving. Our intent is to pay funds back, right? Should I even say that or not?

### You (2025-11-25T15:34:45.459Z)

Yeah. I just. The. The last detail, the better, you know, I would just. Yeah, go ahead, tell them. And. But just say, you know, we can have further conversations after Thanksgiving about how we're going to unwind or something like that, right?

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:35:03.939Z)

Okay? Don't even mention.

### You (2025-11-25T15:35:05.619Z)

One thing to bring up with Mike is. I've had this twice when I got laid off by a real page and also last time when when I got laid off by Radix that as part of the separation agreement and compensation there was a non disparagement clause. So it was like, yeah, we're going to give you, you know, your accrued vacation plus X amount of dollars. And. But it was contingent upon signing the this agreement. And one of the lines in there was, you know, you cannot disparage the company. Nor can the company disparage you, blah, blah, blah. You know, I mentioned, like, Glassdoor and some of those other websites and everything. And if you were concerned about Lar, I would. I would say we want to have something like that. We're willing to. Pay you what you've invested, plus 5%. You know, and if there's anything over and above that after the negotiation. That clause basically says, you know, if you violate, you know, if you go out there and say bad stuff about us, then you're going to be in violation of this and, you know, you're going to always money that was given. And plus damages or whatever. I mean, we can put it into that. Let Sherman. Come up with way of phrasing that, but.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:36:36.339Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-25T15:36:37.299Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:36:37.299Z)

Okay? Very good. Then that's what will happen and we'll we needed. I know we both need to get ready for this business call with Mark Woodworth is important, right. Because this could really be trajectory changing. So remember we we have replicated and Excel underwriting model in SAS and we have 90% right success. Rate at this point with data extraction using AI tools. And we want to partner with him because this is. This, I always called it when I was at CBRE, unspun gold. Like that. This 8000 hotel data was always unspun gold.

### You (2025-11-25T15:36:46.579Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:37:17.779Z)

And he. It's. Again, it's his baby. He's. He is the he. He built this, right? And so he can save it. So let's work together on how to do that.

### You (2025-11-25T15:37:27.539Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:37:29.059Z)

Very good. Thank you, Howard.

### You (2025-11-25T15:37:33.699Z)

All right. I'm just looking through. Yeah, okay. So. Yeah, no, that's fine. I guess we'll see back in. What, 20 minutes.

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:37:42.339Z)

25 minutes. 20 minutes? Yep.

### You (2025-11-25T15:37:44.259Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-25T15:37:44.659Z)

Bye.
