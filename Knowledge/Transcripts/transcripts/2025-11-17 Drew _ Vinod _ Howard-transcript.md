### Guest (2025-11-17T18:00:27.768Z)

Hello. How are you? Good yourself.

Good. How's the rest of you? Weekend.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:00:39.528Z)

Weekend was okay. Nothing special. Saturday was bit better weather so we went outside.

### You (2025-11-17T18:00:48.010Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:00:49.688Z)

Sunday was very, very windy. But just didn't step out at all. Today. It's freezing.

### You (2025-11-17T18:00:58.730Z)

Sounds like they're getting the exact same brother.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:01:02.488Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:01:02.650Z)

Kind of did the same thing. It was pretty nice over the weekend, but it's definitely cooler. Now.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:01:12.328Z)

This office is called. I have to put on my port. You're saying something.

### You (2025-11-17T18:01:23.610Z)

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:01:58.328Z)

Yep. That's a command. Place.

### You (2025-11-17T18:02:25.610Z)

It's only a couple of minutes late. We'll give them some time. Here.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:02:32.808Z)

How's your weekend?

### You (2025-11-17T18:02:37.130Z)

It was pretty low key. Like, yesterday was just outright boring. I didn't really have anything to do with. Actually, I probably did. But I toldly forgot about it. I didn't really just kind of. Watched football most of the day, did almost nothing. Then in the evening, I remembered I had to work on that. Wonderful. So I went and made a bunch of changes on the maps. Sent it out to review. And. Should be all good. To go. I'll go ahead. And put the document together. On that. I did. Take some screenshots. And note all the new fields that I made that weren't on the original. So we know what. One additional database field we. Need to add. There we go.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:03:33.848Z)

Hey, guys. All right. It was good. We went to go see Moulin Rouge, the musical with our older daughters. Which was fun.

### You (2025-11-17T18:03:46.730Z)

Nice. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:03:48.728Z)

Yeah. And then just hung out.

### You (2025-11-17T18:03:50.650Z)

Co. Ol?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:03:51.768Z)

Yeah. How about you guys?

### You (2025-11-17T18:03:55.770Z)

Just talking about that. It's pretty amazing weekend for me.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:04:01.368Z)

Always nice.

### You (2025-11-17T18:04:03.610Z)

Yeah. Appreciate you jumping on the call here. Wanted to just have a good view into the. Conversation that Benoit and I have been having. It's nothing new. But. I think the relationship between Diane and LARC is deteriorating to a point where. I don't. Know how it's going to. Affect your best AI. I'm starting to. Get concerned. Whether we're just going to trash everything we've done, she's just going to stop. Working on it. I don't know. So I guess. I'm kind of reaching out. Because. I think the three of us are going to have to be the peacekeep. Ers. And try. To figure out a way. To get them to work. Together. I like mark. I don't have any issues with market. I've never had a personal. Deal with him. My disagreements are more on the job. Role. And compensation. Not mark himself. At this point, I'm willing to. Be very. Flexible. I'm awful. So if we can get Mark. I. Don't want to do any more to push. Him out. But you talked to Lark. Way more than. I do. And I just kind of wanted. To get your take. On. Main relationship. And what thoughts. That. We could. Try to move forward with. This.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:05:55.528Z)

I mean, I'm not. I mean, Mark and Diane's relationship. For lack of others. Problematic, but I would get it. Like my relationship with Diane is deteriorating rapidly. Like I. Have been consistently more and more frustrated with her. And the things that she is doing. And how I adversely impacts what the rest of us are trying to do. And, you know, I also want to be, you know, empathetic. I've been in her situation, and I know how stressful and awful it is. And at the same time. It like there's not a business left. You know, like, if she does, she. There almost isn't a business left anyway. At this point. The way I see it. The business. Is. Like she. And again, like she's put she. Offered it too much to driftwood. She's now bound to work for them. And she needs the money that. To get. She needs the money that she should be compensated for working from them. And she promised, sort of like, you know, promise, that money would go to us to help the business. And. It's not going to. Or she doesn't. You know, like, she. So, like, it can't be two places at once. So.

### You (2025-11-17T18:07:26.490Z)

I called last Thursday. I started to. Giving a review to my conversation that I had with her on that before. And then. We know. That, and everybody dropped before I had an opportunity to finish it. So I'm not going to get down into the weeds. But we're on the same page in terms of what. Happened with Griftwood, and I tried my best to explain it to her. And at the end of the conversation, she understood that she, number one. She was wrong for not circulating. Both. Safe note and. Her agreement. Before. Signing it. And. As well as the financing and. Payments and everything like that. So, as I mentioned right before the end of the call Thursday, she does have a written. Agreement. With driftwood. Where they give their approval to use it for salaries. Pay. But nevertheless. I think. She now understands what. The odd frustration was. And the fact that she just went. Ahead and did this. She repeatedly said, well, I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was making it easier for everybody. I thought. She kept going on and on about how. She had a very difficult time accepting responsibility for how it was handled. And then when Beren and I were talking, We also questioned her. Judgment. Based on her personal. Situation, right? I mean. She is. Delinquent on her. November mortgage. From. What I can tell. And. Did that. Possibly cloud her gentleman.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:09:23.848Z)

I mean, yeah, sure, that's a horrible thing. Yeah, I don't. I would never vote that for anybody. So, like, I don't want. I want to do whatever. You know, we. We can do to, you know, reasonably help her. Like, I'm not comfortable giving her a loan personally. Like, I'm already, like, I put money into this company, and I. That was risk enough for me. And I'm not confident that I, you know, going to see that back at this point, but I hope that I do. So, like. Yes. I 100% think that cloud science judgment. It would cloud anybody's judgment. And I get the Diane she has said she needs the money. And I was not under any like, I. Thought if I knew what she was going to do or what she wanted to do with this money. Like she. I thought she made that very clear. I also thought we made it clear that we did not agree to that. And perhaps the disconnect is that she thinks that that doesn't matter. She thinks it's her company and therefore she can do with it as she pleases. But that is not the case. Anymore. She?

### You (2025-11-17T18:10:44.010Z)

That definitely could be. One of the things that she kept mentioning is that she kept repeating or something. We talked about this in our weekly meetings, and everybody knew what I was.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:10:56.808Z)

Yeah, we did. We did. We talked about it. Whatever.

### You (2025-11-17T18:11:00.890Z)

We. Talked about it. But at no point did anybody ever agree that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:11:06.648Z)

In fact, if anything, If anything, we adamantly said we do not agree. Like that is not okay. That cannot happen that way.

### You (2025-11-17T18:11:13.370Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:11:15.288Z)

And she.

### You (2025-11-17T18:11:18.010Z)

I'm so glad specifically told her that our four people that did not hear what she says that she said. In terms of that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:11:26.648Z)

Yeah, or. Or. Or did. Here. And again, I heard. I heard her say it. And I said, we don't agree to that. That's not okay. You can't do that. Not only can't you, you shouldn't like it's a bad idea. Like it is going to create penalties, fines, issues with driftwood like it, it is a fiscally, legally, morally irresponsible thing to do. And she. 's done it anyway, or is going to do it anyway. Out of desperation. So, like.

### You (2025-11-17T18:12:02.650Z)

I reviewed. Her contract and the way that they've got the payment set up. Is. Wrong. And. We spoke about that as well. That. There should have been a clear delineation between. Her consulting work. And. The safe note. And that's what I told her. I said, everybody. On the call, the four of us. Agree. D that. You said you were going to work for them for free in exchange for the $75,000. That. Was part of the agreement that you brought up. But. Now. We made earlier that. Her consulting agreement. Sends 75,000. Dollars. Payable via the safe note. So there's no compensation dollar amount scheduled for her on the consulting. It just says, yeah, we're going to give you this 75,000. In exchange for the consulting. But then the safe mode itself. Does not mention anything. And so all she's got is this email thread. Where it says that. They agree that. We can pay it out of that, but it should have been.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:13:23.448Z)

Not even sure how that matters. Like it's not driftwood. Does not. Get to say like that, doesn't there? Whether they. They say it's okay to be used for compensation is irrelevant.

### You (2025-11-17T18:13:34.010Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:13:34.648Z)

They sign a safe note. The safe note has no stipulations on how we use that money, so.

### You (2025-11-17T18:13:39.610Z)

I.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:13:39.768Z)

Like.

### You (2025-11-17T18:13:39.770Z)

Think that came out in the conversation that we had. Probably a couple months ago. Where? We. Need to add standards. Take a type of a salary or compensation until we get like a series. A or we have fish and cash or recover it. And I think that started. One of the reasons why she had that email swag was saying, ok, well, this is a safe note. It's not CB Henny. I may be getting money out of it and kind of went that way.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:14:07.688Z)

Yeah, I put in the budget that there would be compensation. I think there's also just a fundamental and I tried to explain this to her, I fundamental misunderstanding of what. Compensate like. Taking a distribution from the company like that. I mean, for one, it. It's like a dividend. Right. Like you don't do that. Unless you're right. Like companies that give dividends are generally big, stable companies that have nowhere else to invest their money. Right. That is not what we are. We would take all this money and we would be putting it, keeping it in the company to grow the company. If growing the company means, like paying salaries to certain individuals. Fine. Whether their founders or not, that's fine. But that means they get paid through, like, W2 compensation, right? Like if I. When I was the individual, sole owner of my company, I took my. I didn't set up payroll. I just took things as a distribution because I couldn't. There was no one else. Didn't matter. As soon as I had a jv partner. I did that, and they smacked me on the wrist real hard. And they were like, you need to put that money back. Or you're gonna. I mean, they're refined tax implications. Like all this stuff. So, you know, I mean, I. I didn't. I couldn't put the money back. So they were like, well, then we get a similar distribution. And so I. They had. They took, you know, their prorated distribution for the same amount. If Diane's gonna take 30,000 of, like, That means we're all gonna get a $30,000 distribution. Not that we have to take it, but in our, in our accounts, on our ledger book, we all then have to basically get. You know, like take $30,000 out or get $30,000 added to it, so it just doesn't work. Like, mathematically, from an accounting perspective, like, it doesn't work. And driftwood, I think would be very, would not like, you know, like, presumably they're gonna ask for, you know, a year end statement and they're gonna see on their statement if they don't have the amount of money that. They've thought they did. Or, you know, like. Or whatever. I don't even know how you account for a safe.

### You (2025-11-17T18:16:17.530Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:16:19.848Z)

Note. But. It just doesn't work.

### You (2025-11-17T18:16:22.970Z)

Yeah. I don't know. I know nothing about the accounting for it, but when we were talking about that, And I asked her if this is just a one time $8,500. Or does she expect this to be a monthly thing and she substitute out this isn't insight.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:16:43.768Z)

Y. Eah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:16:44.970Z)

Her movement is six months. So that's $51,000. Which means, essentially, grifter gave us $24,000.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:16:55.608Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-17T18:16:55.610Z)

For oper. Ations. Which is. And then I mentioned that in my point of. She was like. I can tell she was confused.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:16:56.888Z)

Which.

### You (2025-11-17T18:17:02.250Z)

It obviously did not think about it. That way. I don't know what to do from here. I don't. Know. What?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:17:13.048Z)

I mean, hence. Yeah, I. So my two. I mean, I don't even think the Mark Diane thing. Is. I mean, sure. Problematic. But like, again, I think from my point of view, it is increasingly become Diane's actions are problematic. And I appreciate that. She brought us together and she created the company. And I've been talking. I've known her for years at this point. And have always enjoyed talking with her and. All this. But, like. You know, Mark. Mark can be a dick. Don't get me wrong, but I think he is right on 90% of this. And I personally and professionally, have learned a lot by. His. The things he's. Said. And it's been very, you know, enlightening to do it for this business and apply it to my own business. And I think it is part of our responsibility to try to educate. Diane, like we all should be educating each other so that we, you know, we succeed. You know, we all succeed together. But Diane has not taken to that. And I would imagine partly because she's stressed out. And she's desperate. For money. And I feel like I want to be empathetic there, but at the same time, An impediment to the business. To. I mean, to developing the product, to doing things right. I got a call from Remitley yesterday that said that they put a hold on the money. Because we don't have proper documentation. Part of which is an operating agreement. And I was able to get them to put send the money through. So it's going to continue to go, but I probably won't be. We will not be able to send money to India. Next month without an operating agreement. And at this point, Like, we all. Or I should say meat, whatever. Like me and her, we all kind of dilly dallyed on that initially, but at this point, She doesn't have the time to do it. To review it. And she wants to and says that she needs to, but it's, like, slowing us down. We have the points that we agreed to last week that whatever, 10 points. Five of them require some updates to the operating agreement, like best thing and whatnot. And then we get by. Attorney could do that. In two hours. And. We get it signed and done. But, like, Diane has to agree to let go and that she's not going to get to review it.

### You (2025-11-17T18:19:55.210Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:19:58.968Z)

So.

### You (2025-11-17T18:19:59.210Z)

Anything else. That we talked about. That I haven't. Brought up or mentioned. You can think. Of.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:20:07.768Z)

Now, when you have this. I would think you guys said I kind of agree on all those. Then we have to find a way out. Like, how do we move forward? Right? One is the immediate situation, which is. Dying. You're not getting that money. I'm also wondering how would Rift would agree? To transfer money to her personal account when they gave that money to InnVestAI not to have. Well, I think it makes it very clear that she positioned this as it's her company. And she and the company are one in the same and we are just working for her. Yeah, which is not to cancel that entire thing. Yeah, that's not how. I mean. I personally don't think of it that way. Like. I put in way more time and effort and money. It's not a company. Or still it's a hard company. When she was just thinking about it five years ago. Now they're five equal partners. So it is everybody's company, not just her. Yeah, I don't know how to revert whatever she did with. So one is. That other one is how do we move forward? Right. Yes. Mark and Diane, situation is one thing is how do we move forward in future? Like, how do we take decisions in future? We don't want to end up in the similar situations that we arrive now. I mean, I. Because my suspicion. I mean, like, Diane's not gonna. If it comes between the money and, you know, putting the money into the company and paying her mortgage like I suspect she's got it. She just. Bare mortgage. I get that. So that means the 25 or whatever, the 75,000 is really just compensation for. Her work, which she should be compensated for. Like they should never have offered to work for free. So she should be compensated for that. That's just what that is. The company. Just, you know, either has to find either make do with. I mean, unless we want to tell her. I did suggest that, like, she should just get paid for our work. These are two different things. She like, oh, this is gonna take forever or it will take a lot for me to. For some reason. Yeah. She said she created a series of expectations that are, you know, once the expectation. Is in place, it's gonna be difficult to change. I'm not if I were Driftwood. And she came back and said, oh, so actually. I need. Like, that's a totally different, like, whoa. This is completely, completely not what was discussed. And again, this comes from, like, She doesn't have. I don't know. She again, like. Was desperate for the money. And and. Or didn't have the. Like acumen to negotiate them separately, which I'm not saying I would either. I'm a horrible negotiator. I hate negotiating. I'd let Mark do it. He probably loves negotiating, you know, arguing with people, but. Yeah, I. So. I don't know. I mean. Yeah. I mean, one of this situation with Driftwood. So how do we resolve that? And then, you know, other decision that we have to take. Or hard working with Mark or she doesn't want to work with Mark or Mark doesn't want to work with her. Mark similar to me. I'm concerned that she's a liability. At this point. And. I mean, obviously, like, she, you know, brought us all together and is also an equal partner. Like, I. He's not suggesting voting her out. Like. Nor am I. However, you know, it is clear her actions are, you know. Had negative consequences. I mean. Some. I mean, like, getting Driftwood to be excited about us and invest in us, in theory is a good thing, is a positive consequence. But like, the way it was done and how it's playing out has actually been, I think is going to be negative and pet negative, right? So she asked all of us to come in and help to create a company. But she's not, you know, then she's going ahead and doing things very unilaterally. Without taking art advice or suggestions. So that's Mark's concern, which I, you know, I share. Diane. Thanks. Marcus being a jerk. And he is, I guess, being a jerk. Fine. Like, you know, his tone and whatnot. His style of communication is a bracelet to her. Again, Agreed. You know, like. She. And she needs money, like, so I get. You know, I get that. The question is, like, you know. My. My suggestion. Was going to be that the money gets deposited. Into like we. Finalized the operating agreement. You know, get a bank account. Deposit the money into InnVestAI She can take a loan. From InnVestAI. Which things that are given as loans are much. You know, even it doesn't look any different. But you just call it a loan on your books. And therefore it's treated differently. So she can take a loan of $8,500 this month, 8,500 next month. And it'll be tracked differently. And then we get W2 is set up. So that she can be paid as a W2. And, you know, that's the same mechanism you two, you know, would get paid through when the time comes. And. You know, she can start getting paid, but, like, that gives us Runway to actually. Use the 75,000 to do things right, like to. Suggested this in the email to her, right? I did, yeah. What I suggested. Yeah. And. I know she doesn't like the idea of a loan because she doesn't want to get stuck paying it back. I get. I think she just doesn't understand that this is not. She had, you know, traumatic experience when she was cbre prior employer, where they. How they pay. It just. It doesn't matter. She didn't want to do it. Even though I'm like, this is not the same thing. This is not this bad thing you were talking about before. Like, sure, you might have to give some stock in the future and to pay back this loan, but it's not you're. Not. It's. I don't know. She? Just didn't understand or didn't want to understand and go. But that. That to me is like, really the only way to go about it. Like, I don't think there is any other way.

### You (2025-11-17T18:27:44.090Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:27:48.648Z)

I think, yeah, that's. That's the right approach. I don't know what you think I would.

### You (2025-11-17T18:27:54.490Z)

I agree. You just fell out and I think. She stops listening when she hears a little. And thinks that she's at some point in the future going to have to get out of their checkbook and write a check. Whereas. We can declare distributions and then subtract the loan amount out of the distribution.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:28:15.528Z)

Yes, exactly.

### You (2025-11-17T18:28:16.090Z)

Called.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:28:17.048Z)

Yeah, exactly. The chance that there would she would ever have to write a check to pay the company back. Is. Like, you know, might as well be nil.

### You (2025-11-17T18:28:31.610Z)

Let me run this past you. When Beren and I were discussing this, As well. One of the thoughts that I had is I agree. I think she's over her head. I don't think. She? Is properly. Running this as a company. And I talked about. What if you and I. Were. Co CEOs. We didn't have to put it in the title. Whatever. But we basically formed the U.N. diane and myself. I would rather have an idea, but he's got a full time job and I think he's got enough on his shoulders, right? Now. But. If. Maybe start with that group of three. And. Basically, it would have to be. So two out of the three would have to prove something, maybe for things like this. All three. Of us. But she's always brought up this whole thing about a female line organization. That's fine. She could be a figurehead. And circle these sex right not repeat that CEO title. Let it be. The face of the InnVestAI There's a female led CEO. But she. Can't. Be. Allowed to be the sole decision maker because she part of the thinks she is. She's a CEO. But she under five years. Thinks she can probably take solidity like she did with driftwood. And I don't know how else to do it. But. Then she thought that came up. We're talking. I don't know if it's viable or not. But.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:30:19.288Z)

Yeah, that's. I mean, possibly one way to go about it. I mean, I. I do think it needs to. Yeah. Made clear to her. That it's not just her company anymore, and. She's not the one running it.

### You (2025-11-17T18:30:46.650Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:30:47.448Z)

Whether, you know, titles. I think, Vinod, you were the one that suggested that it, you know, we really, at this point don't need titles. It's almost. I didn't think. That like I'm CEO of my own company, but, like, that doesn't mean Jack anything like. Like doesn't mean anything. I would. I was assuming that. That's how she felt as well. That, like, you know, it doesn't need anything, but maybe. It. Maybe it is. Maybe it is giving her the, you know. The. The. The notion that she can take few things more unilaterally. Or even.

### You (2025-11-17T18:31:28.650Z)

Pitchfork as well.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:31:31.848Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:31:32.570Z)

But. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:31:37.448Z)

What I was going to say is we just have the. The we're all co founders. We don't necessarily need titles. We have our areas of focus. And I mean, what did I say in that email, right? There's, you know, there's the nine things that need to get done. I mean. The way the company is set up, it doesn't mean a CEO or doesn't meet, right? Like it's five of us, you know, make certain decisions by supermajority, four or five, and other decisions by majority. Like this. It's not a company that needs a CEO, doesn't need co CEOs. It doesn't really need any of that. I mean. I'm happy. I don't actually. It would probably. It would be somewhat problematic for me to be in that because I'm already doing a shit ton more for this than my I'm supposed to, per my other business and my investors there.

### You (2025-11-17T18:32:29.290Z)

Y.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:32:29.528Z)

And I, at some point, have to tell them what I'm doing here, and they're probably going to be absolutely furious about how much time and effort I've invested into this.

### You (2025-11-17T18:32:29.530Z)

Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:32:36.888Z)

Because it was. I told them it was going to be like. I don't mean it. If anything, I need to be not in a position at all. I need to be like an advisor.

### You (2025-11-17T18:32:44.250Z)

Okay? That makes sense. So I am in 100% agreement. That the titles need to be. Gone. We need to get rid of. Them. But one thing that just occurred to me while you were talking is one of the comments that she made is, I just used the safe note template that Drew gave me. So could you take your safe note template? And add spaces for five signatures.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:33:15.048Z)

Y. Eah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:33:15.290Z)

And make it clear. I don't know if there's anything we can do retroactively for district. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not. But. We can know that going forward. It looks very clear. That it has to. Have five signatures. From the. Five founders.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:33:37.128Z)

Well, I think an issue an easier way to do that.

### You (2025-11-17T18:33:37.450Z)

Before.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:33:40.168Z)

Because flap is a lot. An easier way to do that is, and this is part of what I was proposing is in the LLC operating agreement. Everyone has an area of focus and certain capabilities. Like. Any of the five of us. Theoretically, could agree, could go. Could go. Think. Oh, and let's say I need this. He's a lease agreement on a copier. So we could go do that unilaterally. We could. Then I could just come back and be like, hey, I took $1,000 a month lease off a copier that I'm putting in my home. And companies didn't pay for it and you give. Well, you guys would all be like, well,

### You (2025-11-17T18:34:16.650Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:34:17.848Z)

That's fucking wild. That's crazy, you asshole. But.

### You (2025-11-17T18:34:23.850Z)

The safe note.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:34:25.048Z)

Well, I think what we do is we just say, yeah, but like we say, we'd be more prescriptive as to what certain people are allowed to do. And Diane. Is not one of the people that can sign a safe note. We require that something that is invest in investment like that, or a debt or any of these. One of the things that require supermajority requires at least two signatures. Diane can be one of them, but it requires at least one other. Just like all these meetings that she's been doing and talking, which is great over the last five years, but now they need two people. So that there are confirmation of what is being talked about and what expectations are being said. And. If somebody goes, Mark or Diane go to lunch with somebody, obviously somebody's not going to put speakerphone while they were at lunch, but with reasonable effort, there should be two people. So that's the way I would think that gets handled in. Going forward for these sorts of investment safe notes. Taking on debt, anything. Like that.

### You (2025-11-17T18:35:38.170Z)

All right. So next steps.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:35:42.808Z)

I mean, Diane has to agree to what we're doing, to these nine points that we talked about. Or if she doesn't agree, then we just tell her we're doing this anyway. And I don't know if she has told them to distribute the money to her account. If she has.

### You (2025-11-17T18:36:00.250Z)

I don't think she has. I did mention to her that if it was positive you can do personal account or anything like that, that would destroy the company.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:36:11.128Z)

I mean. It wouldn't destroy the company as long as we can still, you know, I think like it would be. I think it would be. It's a bad look, certainly. If she then can't give 75,000 to put into the company. Then I think that. I think it. We need to be able to deposit 75,000 in a company count when it's created. Even if we turn around immediately and give her 8500, distribute it back out, the 8500 can call it a loan. Like, I think it's important to have that initial 75,000 come in. Cleanly so it can go into a driftwood designated account on the ledger. And then we can distribute the money back out to her for the next two months as a loan. But we can't do that until this operating agreement is agreed to and.

### You (2025-11-17T18:36:59.690Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:37:03.288Z)

I also. I know. You. Diane doesn't. It doesn't like talking to Mark because Mark makes her feel like she's doing something wrong all the time. And I think she's starting to feel that way with me. And I try to be patient and like, I'm trying to not make her feel that way. I also think that. She has to be able to have these difficult conversations. Like she wasn't able to join our call on Thursday, but which, you know, like, because she was too busy, but she was able to talk to you for how, 30 minutes or an hour like that morning? That call. That 30 minutes or an hour she spent on the phone with you should have been the time she spent with all of us. And I know she doesn't want to talk to all of us.

### You (2025-11-17T18:37:44.170Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:37:46.568Z)

That's not the point. Like she. Like, if she doesn't want to do that, then she's not part of the company. Anymore. Or she is opting to not be part of the, you know, operational part of the company if she doesn't want to do that. She can keep her the 20% and just do some, like, do something else in the meantime. I know she doesn't. I'm not suggesting that realistically. Like, I know she doesn't want to do that, but that's effectively what she would be doing. And I feel like this is somewhat. I'm asking you, don't do that with her unless you talk to us ahead of time. So we can be clear on what the message is. Because I think it only gets through this false sense of, like, I got in the email response. Response. She's like, you guys have more work to do, whatever. And I. Even now, I was like, no, we don't. There's no nothing more here to talk about. This is. Like Steve needs to get on board with what we are doing and what the four of us have agreed to. Nothing has changed. There is no other way to do it.

### You (2025-11-17T18:38:52.250Z)

Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:38:53.128Z)

I am happy to respond to her. Last email on that initial thread from last week. And they, you know, she said, Here are the points we agreed to. Whatever. She didn't even respond. She said. Oh, no, this is just in the four of us.

### You (2025-11-17T18:39:23.450Z)

Yeah. The main things that LARC said was just the four of us. Didn't have dying on the thread.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:39:29.208Z)

Oh, yeah. But then she said, 5:30 calls. She's like, I can't make it. I said, really need to be there. She said I can't. If there's a lot to be discussed between you, Mark, Howard and Vinod, I think you guys need time to talk. We can talk about. Pick it up on the week of Thanksgiving. I didn't respond to her, but I can respond to her and say, We don't have anything more to talk about. Four of us. We more or less agree. On what needs to be done. And I was going to prefer to go over these nine points that we have with her on a call. But if she can't make that call, then I will email it to her and be like, hey. This is it. This is what we're doing. You have 24 hours to respond. Or it's being done.

### You (2025-11-17T18:40:24.330Z)

Okay? I know it's not important to think you and I both pointed out there's a few things that could be done after the LLC was executed. Changes to that. So. Maybe we should break that out. Into what must be done. In the llc. Visionals can wait. And I also think.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:40:51.288Z)

I don't think any of them need to be done. After I initially was like, yeah, we could do a side letter. But Mark in Vinod has echoed this as well. That's just going to keep this as an open running.

### You (2025-11-17T18:41:03.290Z)

If you want to just say these. Out of those nine things, I'm good with that. I'm not going to get any objection to that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:41:08.408Z)

Ok? Then I'm just going. Yeah, I mean the vesting schedule. There'll be an employment agreement Mark sent over which goes in as an exhibit. They will all have to sign before we receive compensation. Sources and uses. I mean, this can probably be done. Sources and uses and the use of funds like a budget. I don't know if that needs to go any done separately. But it needs to be agreed to. And the vesting plan needs to be added. This fundraising two on a call should be added to the operating agreement. Governance. This is already agreed to. And she's. Instead of a call with her that's obviously not in the llc, but. Yeah, so, like, half these things are things that go into the llc, but I think they should all be done now. I didn't do anything yet because I want to get her. I want to let her know that these things are being added. And I wanted to give her the chance to review, but she has not done that. And again, the team in India is not going to get paid. I'm already. It's getting close to $10,000 that I've spent on this business. And I'm not going to do that anymore.

### You (2025-11-17T18:42:25.770Z)

I want you to get. It done. Lang and sand. All right? So I hate to ask you to do anything, but since you and I experience the pain versus Lane versus everything else, Let's just leave those nine points that may. Be in theory? I don't know. Should it be the same email? Basically. Talk about.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:42:47.448Z)

No, I'll send a new email. I'll send a new email. I mean, and I will send an email to the four of us with Mark to say, hey. Diane has not responded. And has not joined our last call, and I don't know if she will. So I'm going to send her this email and I will give you and Benoit and Mark the chance to agree. To me doing that. And I will send her an email. Obviously copy all of you. And I'll be like, hey, look. This is not worth the discussion. All the discussions are over. We all agree this needs to happen. So you're welcome to call me or you're welcome to join our next call. I don't think that anything is going to change that at this point. Like what we're doing. But I, you know. Is she still part of the company? So I. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:43:37.130Z)

Yeah. The only thing we can do most of the time. And. Then what? We have to have five furnitures on the off seat. She says no, I'm not going to agree to this. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:43:59.048Z)

Yeah, it either means company. Or. We can proceed without her. We can decide that she can be a non member. Of the company. She will be a non voting member. She would just have economic interest. And four of us can proceed without her. Honestly, that's probably more likely.

### You (2025-11-17T18:44:23.930Z)

Okay? All right. I want to be. Ahead of ourselves. When I'm wondering, does that mean we got to get a different name in different Ein things?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:44:36.808Z)

No, no, no. We wouldn't have to do anything. We would just take her signature line off the operating agreement.

### You (2025-11-17T18:44:36.890Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:44:44.008Z)

And it would submit it. The four of us being the operating members. You know, the founding members. She would have 20% economic interest or whatever it is we should have. No voting rights, no operational input, nothing. She'd literally just be a passive. Asset investor.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:02.010Z)

All right. And then expanding about the main part. Is that something you can. Do as well. Probably separately. But I just need somebody to walk her through holding her hand.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:12.728Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:17.770Z)

And extending to her. It might be called the loan, but it doesn't mean you have to write a check back. I mean, I think she just. I don't think she just understands that. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:27.288Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:27.930Z)

It's. Kind of the impression of that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:28.168Z)

Yeah, I don't think she. And I think she does. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:31.290Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:33.768Z)

All right.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:35.610Z)

Well, thanks for.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:36.008Z)

I'll work on.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:37.610Z)

Having me.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:37.688Z)

This.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:39.050Z)

Not a great conversation to have, but it has to be done. Something's got to be done.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:44.408Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T18:45:46.810Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:45:46.968Z)

Yeah. If, you know, if she does reach out to you, I think again, important that you. I mean, if you're comfortable, like, hey, look, Diane, I can't. I shouldn't be having these one on one conversations anymore. This is not productive. You need to be a member of the group. Or not. I mean, obviously, like, we can have one on one conversations, but I think that in this immediate juncture, She that needs to be made clear to her. That like? Un. Fortunately. So.

### You (2025-11-17T18:46:20.250Z)

That. Makes sense. All right. I see you jump back on anything else.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:46:30.408Z)

You're on mute. I know. Are you there?

### You (2025-11-17T18:46:42.010Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:46:42.728Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T18:46:42.970Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:46:44.408Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-11-17T18:46:45.290Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-11-17T18:46:45.608Z)

All right. Thanks, guys.
