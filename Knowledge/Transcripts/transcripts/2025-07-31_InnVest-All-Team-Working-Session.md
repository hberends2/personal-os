# Transcript for: InnVest All Team Working Session

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:31:42.210Z)

Yeah. And then so we're excited for that.

### You (2025-07-31T21:31:47.007Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:31:48.960Z)

Right. Right. Yeah. Howard. Hey.

### You (2025-07-31T21:31:59.787Z)

Hello. How's everything going? Good.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:32:03.590Z)

Hey. Great. How about you?

### You (2025-07-31T21:32:04.447Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:32:19.190Z)

One moment. Hello? Hello. Hey, everyone. Hi. Mark, you look like you're in a car. Yes. I'm driving. Okay. Alright. So let's jump in. I I think today, if we could do this, let's start with maybe some housekeeping things and go through those as quickly as possible, and then spend some time really having some good dialogue around, like, our pitches and how we're gonna organize our pitches and things like that, if that if that's alright with the group. Sure. Yeah. And I would like to give you a quick demo of the development so far. Whenever you guys in for that. Great. So let's start with the most basic and boring housekeeping thing. Is the operating agreement. Drew, thank you for finding one that's better for a SaaS. Yep. So I guess we all we all just need to read it. Right? That's, like, the like, a next step. I mean, I I don't think you need to do that yet. I mean, you can. Okay. I think it would make more sense for somebody at some one of us, and I think probably me first, can just go through and like, it it has a lot of sections where it's like, you can pick this or this. This or this, this or this. Depending on how The very first one is, like, the purpose of the company is whatever. And the company can do whatever it wants under Delaware law to to fill that purpose. Or the company can do whatever it wants to fill that purpose except for and then you can list exceptions. The company cannot take out a loan, cannot assume debt, cannot have employees, cannot right? You just whatever you want. Right? So somebody has to go and a lot of it's gonna be, like, I think very, like, easy to to just to just remove the stuff that we don't need, but think somebody's I should do that first. Okay. And then we can, you know, guys can review it or we can run it through perplexity or something to summarize. Then we would have my attorney can go through and, you know, review and finalize and answer any questions and then and, yeah, let me know. Okay. And I know I know we were rushing to try to the operating agreement done because the bank account But if I'm following all the email that's going we're we're going to actually now actually do the operating agreement. Right? Like, this would be our operating agreement. And whereas the other one, was just thinking we'd it really quick to get the bank account open and then actually work on a real operating agreement. But are do I understand the direction we're going is this will be really our operating agreement unless for some unfortunate reason, something massively changes and and all five of us agree we need to go in and modify it in some way. Yeah. And I hopefully, that doesn't require you know, hopefully, we aren't, like, like, hopefully, we can do it quickly still. Yeah. I mean, obviously, it does require some it will require some discussion and agreement on certain things, like I even look at all the, like, you know, are we all you know, like, if we're gonna assign managers, are there you know, managers with like like, the original agreement had, like, you know, I think it was met, managing them. Direct. I don't know. Anyway, there's, like, different levels of who can do what within the company And it's not critical. It doesn't really, like, mean a whole lot, but something we would have to discuss and agree on. You know, along these these restrictions, they only matter if, like, we're gonna take out a loan or we're gonna do you know, we're gonna merge or get investors We would need you know, is that something we have to agree on? All unanimously? Is it a majority? Is it is it one or two of us can unilaterally make these decisions? You know, that's the kind of thing that has to be decided. Go into the agreement. Okay. Okay. And then just confirming then, how are we gonna make sure we get the nodes team paid. I I'm hoping this will still be able to get done by next this done by next week. And then open the bank account, you know, a few day you know, like, should just take a few days to get it funded and you know, has already communicated with Raj and Shivam that you know, we're working on this, that and we'll get get them paid as soon as we can. Okay. Okay. Alright. So that's the operating agreement. Howard, from your side, is there anything

### You (2025-07-31T21:38:04.537Z)

No. Not not really.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:38:05.530Z)

that's more administrative or just like a a quick update that you have

### You (2025-07-31T21:38:08.377Z)

Still making progress on the pricing Problem is there's just so many options, so trying to determine what would probably be the best or coming up with some alternatives So seeing what we can do there. Without giving it away for free. That's probably not a good thing. And then, yeah, just just the emails that been going back up about the the waterfall. Development. So, yeah, I think I think the best option would be for

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:38:48.400Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T21:38:49.877Z)

Drew and and myself and and you and Mark if you want to be involved in that to come up with a bare minimum waterfall that we could potentially include in version one. Maybe not e maybe not the MVP, but possibly by version one. It wasn't incredibly complicated. Yeah. It did have a

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:39:20.740Z)

Got it. And just because I don't remember this, the model that Mark sent you, was that a JV model that had a waterfall in it?

### You (2025-07-31T21:39:26.087Z)

different thresholds. It was broken down monthly, which we're not gonna be doing in in phase one either. So that's why I think, the model that you provided is the one that I put the screenshot in there that has all of the

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:39:41.480Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T21:39:42.777Z)

necessary KPIs and metrics And if we just stick to a simple you know, whatever the equity split is, eightytwentyseventythirty, whatever it is, and we just create a very basic cash flow. Here's your return. Here's your 30% whatever. We can we can do something like that. So but in order to make sure that I'm not losing my I did take a look at some of the redIQ competitors and I cannot find any of them that provide a waterfall. The only ones that do are the ones that essentially connect to Excel

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:40:26.310Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T21:40:28.327Z)

so the users can use their own waterfall mounts. Which is an option for us as well. We could just simply export into Excel, which we've talked about before that should with I mean, that should be in the model anyway. Right? Everybody has the option, and and it would be just exporting the data. It won't have live formulas.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:40:53.240Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T21:40:56.497Z)

You know? So I I I don't think that's a cop

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:00.580Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:00.717Z)

I think it's a good way to get going without getting bogged down. On on a waterfall issue. So we we have options that we should discuss.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:13.060Z)

Mhmm. Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:20.317Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:21.390Z)

And then you gave us homework over the

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:22.177Z)

That was that was, just to have everybody review the overall

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:24.410Z)

weekend. Right? If I remember from one of your emails, I remember

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:27.717Z)

PRD.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:27.750Z)

weekend homework jumping out at me.

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:28.537Z)

Not the individual components. So just to to make sure nothing was overlooked. I think I also sent out something last night with a link to the document for comments on on that. So there will be a few more, especially, like, when I get to the pricing, I have a suspicion that's gonna have a lot of input that's probably gonna take a lot of back and forth to get that going.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:41:52.670Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T21:41:59.807Z)

But but yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:01.770Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:02.307Z)

Yes. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:06.320Z)

You mean product? Like, how we're gonna price the product?

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:08.177Z)

It is.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:11.040Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:11.917Z)

And there's a tremendous amount of pushback in the industry right now on on just

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:15.300Z)

Yeah. I mean, it's pricing is

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:16.887Z)

basic subscriptions.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:17.610Z)

difficult.

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:18.377Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:42:18.730Z)

Always difficult.

### You (2025-07-31T21:42:19.967Z)

I think that's probably not a way that we want to go. So the question is how do we balance making sure we have a steady income flow and then maybe upsell opportunities, you know, how can we create bundles, Can we do usage based charging, outcome based charging. I mean, there's all sorts of them, and there's no one answer. That's one thing that I've learned so far. It's gotta be a combination of these different things So we'll we'll I will put together a a a plan that we can review and try to determine what would be the best fit for this type of product.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:43:16.490Z)

But we we learn from I think Drew mentioned last week that LARC charges a flat fee per company. So is that something we want to consider? Yeah. They do 30,000, but there's they're I mean, some something like that has to do with cost, although that, you know, cost is not the primary driver of pricing. But, you know, for them, whether a company have you know, they they don't have hotel level data. They sell a very canned product. It doesn't need to you don't need to load anything else into it. It's like you take their PDF reports, and that's it. So it know, makes sense to do a, you know, a very, very fixed pricing. We, with LBIs, do I mean, also, let's let's keep in mind that sorry to cut you off, but, I mean, the pricing

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:04.827Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:44:09.430Z)

that we introduced this with that isn't necessarily our pricing forever. Right? Like, our goal is to just get people using the system

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:16.527Z)

We do. We do. This isn't something we have to have

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:44:17.150Z)

so we can show investors that we have

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:19.687Z)

the end of the week.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:44:19.740Z)

users and some revenue. So

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:21.207Z)

But we have to have something at least in mind. And and I

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:44:22.310Z)

I mean, I think we have some time to think about this.

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:24.257Z)

actually have a good resource that I came across

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:44:25.030Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T21:44:27.277Z)

a couple days ago that talked about the fact that you should charge for the MVP. Not just to give things to people for free, but it has some caveats, but but Mark, the what you just described with LARC, charging $30,000 that that's that's what I was referring to as a subscription. You just subscribe for a flat fee and you get it. That's a very old model. That is really being pushed back on by a lot of businesses. I suspect that they'll probably change, but the theory is instead of charging a flat fee for 30,000 you could probably charge a a base fee of 20,000. And then with additional add ons or usage fees, you might end up getting 35,000. Right? That's that's what we're trying to balance and trying to figure out. So Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:45:32.010Z)

Alright. But, again, I I at at least from my perspective, I

### You (2025-07-31T21:45:33.767Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:45:36.980Z)

I think that the goal number one is just to get people using it and paying us something. I think the equity I think the investors care less about the amount and just more about the fact that people are using it

### You (2025-07-31T21:45:41.437Z)

Yeah. Oh, you're absolutely right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:45:48.200Z)

and willing to pay for it. And then over time as we build market share, I think we can get more aggressive. Okay. And then, Drew, from and I know we're gonna talk about the I'm saving all the pitch discussion to the very, very end so that we can talk about it. And and we have enough time to talk about it in a thorough way. So, Drew, anything administrative on your side that we need to talk about other than the operating agreement? No. I mean, I I was gonna work as a contractor. Agreement I still need to do a little more research, about pay you know, doing these international payments. And, Vinod, did you you I know you you talked to your to to and Raj a little bit about you know, their ability to accept payments. But sounds like from from theirs, point of view, it's just like a they just get paid, and they'll they'll worry about the taxes and all that. Yeah. They'll take care of the taxes. And I don't think this amount is so high that it will be taxable at all. So I don't think we should be worried about that. And they do have their tax IDs. Both of them. India. Yeah. That that's the only other thing on my end. Okay. Then let's flip it over to Vinod. Vinod, what's I wanna I know you wanna show us something. Then if there's anything on your plate that you that we need to go over, let us know. Sure. Sure. So let let's start by showing here you some progress on this. I know I can show it on Monday, which I wanted. So I don't know whether you saw my other email. We have environments here now. So one is called dev, which is just for our engineering group. Whenever we are writing some code on our local computer, we're gonna push to our remote server and that those changes will reflect here on the dev.invest.ai. Then we have another environment which is called stays.investai.com. This will have the stable or the healthy state of the application. So the Dell will have the latest whatever the Dell percept been working on. It stays will have the stable version. I feel like, you know, we have the stable code on dev environment, I'll move the code from dev environment to the staging environment. So the latest changes will reflect on the staging environment, which is this. So this we can use to demo to the client or whatever purpose we want, but this will be the stable environment here. Being said that so we you already know, we have this login page here. We also have kind of put the restrictions so that, you know, outside people cannot access it. So only people with investai.com domain or these two guys Mark. I I didn't know whether Mark

### You (2025-07-31T21:49:03.977Z)

Hey. Yeah. Vinod,

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:49:04.930Z)

uses his investai.com or not, but Mark should be able to use it with his

### You (2025-07-31T21:49:08.147Z)

Drew did not get an InnVestAI. Email either.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:49:10.770Z)

interestingcapital.com ID.

### You (2025-07-31T21:49:12.327Z)

Right? Right? He

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:49:14.080Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-07-31T21:49:14.317Z)

yeah. Yeah. He he he elected to keep his own for the time being.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:49:16.860Z)

Oh, Drew doesn't have it either? Well, I thought he had. Yes. So I lied. Okay. I'll add Drew's ID too. But, yeah, it is the Just to demo you the restrictions, I'll try to log in with my Google account. Okay? So I clicked on I'll go back one time. So here you see continue with Google here. So I click on that. That ID, is not supposed to have the access. So it's an as a so there's something called identity provider. So in our case, right now, have two identity providers. One is Google, another one is Microsoft. Since I clicked on Google button, I'm redirected to Google ITP. Which is identity provider. So I'll click on this one. Since I'm already logged in, it shows like that. This is Google's. And I hit continue. So if you see since I tried to log in with the ID, I'm I don't have access to it. It says access denied. So let's go back. And then what I'm gonna do is continue with my Microsoft ID. Excuse me. So since I was already logged in on Microsoft, I just got you know, straight in. And that's the benefit of s SSO. Right? Suppose you are working in some company and we you to log in with the SSO. You don't have to log in. You're already logged in. You just get logged into our system. No email, no password, nothing is required. You just need to log in once. Or you need to log in to your domain. Once you are logged in, you just get get in. And it is very secured way to And then, you know, when something called token which gets generated and then our system get that token and then from that token, we get which was the user who kind of logged in. We get all that information, and then we determine whether we are we'll authorize that user to access that or not. So

### You (2025-07-31T21:51:31.347Z)

So what is your step by step

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:51:31.520Z)

barely how SSO works. We can also have more IDPs. Right? Just have to decide we need some social or

### You (2025-07-31T21:51:35.837Z)

plan to address this?

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:51:40.440Z)

any other, we can do that. So I'll log out here. Let's try to continue with my Okay. So it's somehow keeping my session active, but I'm logged in right now. And then just for, you know, we were kind of trying to the document with our machine learning model. So we kind of created a dummy thing here. Let me upload a document. Okay. So I did anonymize these documents before. Anyway, we shouldn't be caring about anonymizing now because it's just in our system. So we are not sending them outside. So I'm just dropping that file here. And I say upload. Okay. Something happened. Let oh, Oh, there's that model open. Okay. So I'll say upload. So that documents get gets uploaded in our infrastructure here in AWS. So there's something called bucket. There are different buckets where these documents are supposed to get uploaded. The document basically gets uploaded here. So once this is uploaded, our function gets triggered. Which basically starts the processing of the documents using the machine learning model that we have self hosted right now. Which is not yet perfect but it's kind of doing its job because I upload a file, I can see in my database that it's doing something here. If you see there's an entry here database. And if I show you some data, there's some data here in the affected data, which will basically take and kind of put in our database structure further, which I'll show it to you in a while. Kind of planning to send it through yesterday. So, basically, that processing picks picks up, process the documents, insert the expected data in the database. And once that is done, then, you know, we kind move forward to either showing the deal flow page, or I mean, that right now, we'll show the deal flow or deal list page. So, I mean, yeah, that's where we are right now. We are kind of working more on the extraction side or kind of working on that model. So even with that model, we kind of faced one issue when we started with version three, and then later on, we came to know that the version three is licensed Only version one is like, MIT license, which is free to use for commercial purposes. So we had to downgrade that model to version one. But even that is working fine for our purpose. So that's that's a good thing. As far as the database goes, so enterprise telling yesterday that I'll send you the data with us. Kind of trying to together a diagram which kind of know, will explain how the tables will be later and how they'll create it. I'm just gonna finalize this and then send it across to you, then we can, you know, go over this together whenever you have time. Yeah. Yeah. Let me know when you're ready. Well and, yeah, I think that's really all from my side. As far as AWS costing goes, I think we are any cost right now. I think we still have some free resources available for some time. I've already set up the alerts and also whenever, you know, we do something kinda goes beyond the cost. Thing that I have said. I'll get the alert and you I'll kind of manage the resources on

### You (2025-07-31T21:56:03.137Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-07-31T21:56:04.430Z)

or see if I have to, you know, need more dollars. I'll let you know. But right now, it's under control. So Okay. That's great. That's a great update. Thank you. One question on the call tomorrow that we have at noon eastern. Any I mean, any suggestions on what we're gonna cover or how you want us to frame up the conversation What advice or suggestions would you give us for making your team feel welcome and understand what's going on Yeah. I mean, with the team, Yeah. I mean, that probably, you could tell about the opportunity and how this product is very good product market fit and how we are where we are headed and what's our long term vision. So if you could talk about that, that'll be great. These are very young guys. They don't have a lot of experience, but they're, like, very and, you know, they're very hungry to prove themselves. They put lot of hours of work. And, you know, they have a lot of time, though. They don't have family or kids. So, that's that's the whole point of working with them that, you know, and I mean, they they have definitely excited to work on the technologies like know, the model we are creating, the Okay. Cloud infrastructure and all. So it's like win win. For all of us. Great. And when you say young, twenties young, early thirties young? I don't even know why I'm asking that. I'm just curious about what young means these days. Yeah. So rat is probably 22, 23. Shivam is close to 20. And they both are computer science completed their graduation, I believe. Okay. But they both are they've studied com computer science, and they both have so, particularly, who looks young, he developed one Android and iPhone app. Which uses similar tech stack that we have. She Raj has been working for IT service company in India for, I think, close to two and a half years or something. And he has done all this for cloud and application development. Okay. That's great. Thank you. Hey. Hey, Diane. Just for the record, I consider Young to be fifties. Okay. I do too. I just wanna go on record now. But you got it right. Like, you just so but, no, they're my they're my daughter's age and probably Mark's daughter's age too. And probably Howard's kid's age. So you and Drew are the ones that have younger kids. The rest of us have kids that are their age. Alright. Great. So then let's in just we have about a half hour left, and this is really just meant to be a a a free conversation. But as we have kind of gone through summer and we've had some initial what I'd say they were really conversations to begin with with friends, that were more conversational in nature. But as we narrow that down and try to perfect what a thirty minute conversation is. And I do believe that Mark is right in pushing us in this that people are busy, and so it's hard to ask for more than thirty minutes. Of someone's time. We need to figure out how to get something that and and I'm more conversational, so I'm probably the person that's that has to most figure out how to conform to this. But how to get something that we talk for an hour into more of a thirty minute perfected pitch that gives them time to ask questions and and shows the best of the product. So with that, Mark, can I turn it over to you just to share it? Because I mean, this is really where your strength lies. You know, relative to the rest of us. Can do you mind just, like, taking this talking point for a little bit and sharing your opinion on it? I'm don't have any materials, but I mean, I think conceptually, you know, if if we have a thirty minute window for a presentation, we should probably divide the Mark, I think did we lose you? We lost all your wisdom with that. And we can do this another time as well if this isn't the best time for us and the most productive time. I just know that it's it's timely because we had the discussion with Ellen, and it was the first time we did it in thirty minutes. And so there was a lot to learn from that. Then the future discussions would probably be thirty minutes.

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:02.107Z)

Yeah. Since since Mark is

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:01:03.290Z)

But if if Mark if it and I didn't mean to catch you off guard on this. I just know that

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:04.707Z)

having connection issues, I think. One of the things we can do is is

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:01:07.970Z)

there's been a lot of back and forth. So

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:10.087Z)

perhaps just put together a quick

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:01:10.640Z)

we can definitely schedule another time if it's better.

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:13.687Z)

video of the actual tool because there are so many pieces and it's hard to get in there and show a demo on a live tool. But if we only have thirty minutes, you know, I could put together something that's very quick, high level overview. And then if they are interested, we can schedule another call. That's one option.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:01:53.570Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:55.607Z)

That's a good question.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:01:57.410Z)

Would you show the video on the call, or would you just

### You (2025-07-31T22:01:58.437Z)

I'm still a little leery of

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:01.360Z)

share the video with them after we discuss

### You (2025-07-31T22:02:02.477Z)

too much getting outside of the five of us.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:05.280Z)

the spend thirty minutes discussing the concept and then share the demo video.

### You (2025-07-31T22:02:08.117Z)

Alright? You know, if we

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:10.210Z)

The shortened demo video.

### You (2025-07-31T22:02:10.307Z)

email a video to somebody, who are they gonna forward it to? Right? I I'd be a little leery about that, but other than that, I mean, yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:23.730Z)

Okay. Okay. And I think we we should also maybe even before we get into, like, any of that, maybe just revisit and agree on what we are trying to accomplish with some of these meetings I think are we

### You (2025-07-31T22:02:54.187Z)

Yeah. That's that's a very

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:54.780Z)

genuinely looking for feedback?

### You (2025-07-31T22:02:56.797Z)

yeah, very comparative point.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:02:57.640Z)

On the features and functions? Or are we trying to, like, drum up interest for in for potential customers or investors? That might be, you know, to agree on first. Because it seems like yeah, it seems it seems like the call the other day Ellen was able to provide some some feedback on again, it was, like, features and functions. Which we probably could have done ourselves. To some extent. Some of the things we had not thought of or might not thought of, and others, we we could have And but she also said she, like, she said a couple things like this is something that all of our analysts do already in Excel, albeit, right, And and then we we were it took us a while to get to something which she's there's like, oh, that's a really good hook. When we said that, oh, like, we could increase the efficiency of your analysts. Right? Like, now they can underwrite two times or three times as many deals. She's like, oh, that that's a good hook. So I think maybe, like, what it is I would say, maybe doing a demo right now is maybe even preemptive. Right? Like, right now, we should almost be doing, like, an elevator pitch. Mark and I were talking about this more the other day because it was yesterday, and we didn't didn't necessarily settle on

### You (2025-07-31T22:04:20.067Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:04:20.310Z)

on what we should be trying to get out of these calls and the

### You (2025-07-31T22:04:23.797Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:04:25.400Z)

and how we should be doing it. But I think we need to agree on on that before we even start to think about putting together recorded videos or doing more demos. Right? Like, again, I'd be very explicit to in you know, amongst ourselves and with those that we are talking to, like, what we are trying to get out of it. Right? Can you can you guys can you guys hear me now? Yeah. Now we can hear you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sorry about that technical issue. But yeah. I mean, I think as Drew was saying, I I think that should try to start these calls you know, stating what the you know, stating problems and and trying to really relate the people we're presenting to and and talk about you know, what it is that we see as challenges in the industry and how InnVestAI is going to really you know, address those issues. And make everyone's life easier, both from an efficiency perspective as well as from a data and ultimately AI perspective. Because mean, that's really on everyone's mind right now is is, you know, how are they gonna utilize data and AI to improve upon their way of doing business? And so, you know, we've been trying to put together some some thoughts in terms of a narrative so that we can have a script. And then I think as the model evolves, you know, with the presentations could be more focused on the technology. But I think for for now, you know, I think the majority of the conversation should probably be more, you know, verbal in terms of just addressing what our our plan is for the company. Okay. So would you mark then I mean, there'd be no demo in that case. Right? We would just if there's interest, we would schedule a demo after. Yeah. I mean, I think that as the model evolves, I think, you know, showing the demo will be helpful. But I think at this point, you know, the model is is really comprised of elements that most of our users are are familiar with that. And so I I think that maybe we show the model but maybe the predominance of the conversation is narrative. So, you know, maybe if you have a thirty minute period, you know, maybe 40% of the time is spent on narrative, maybe 30% is spent on some kind of demo, and then we spend time with Q and A.

### You (2025-07-31T22:06:43.157Z)

Yeah. I I I agree. And remember, the POC was never intended to be

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:06:47.040Z)

Or or some ratio. I think it's good to show

### You (2025-07-31T22:06:47.857Z)

a demo. For external clients. I mean, I don't mind showing others, but

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:06:50.490Z)

the model in some way just to show that it's real

### You (2025-07-31T22:06:53.157Z)

you know, it doesn't

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:06:53.240Z)

but I think we should spend the majority of the time

### You (2025-07-31T22:06:54.357Z)

not everything on there works or is functioning. It's some of it's just hard

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:06:55.920Z)

talking about what the vision is. Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T22:06:59.327Z)

coded. So I I think personally, we should deemphasize a demo but not rule it out if they want to see something. Until we have the NBP in a better better place to where we can actually show the MVP But if somebody says, Yeah, I'm really interested. Can you show me something? Then then, yeah, we can probably do a second call. That's I I agree. I think the first call should be more high level like like Marco's describing.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:07:53.490Z)

We can even talk about our own experience, you know, pain points we've noted identified, from our own experiences, And how we are going to address those and you know, ask for other, you know, other pain points, other opportunities we, you know, might not have thought of. Or that might be very acute for a particular customer then we can come back when we have the MVP, and we can

### You (2025-07-31T22:08:18.717Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:08:21.370Z)

we've gotten intel, and we can be very, very specific about how our product addresses this these these pain points, these acute pain points that that customer had mentioned. Right? Don't think we Yeah. That's a that's a great that's a great point. I mean, we could just literally ask them what what limitations do they have today with their current model? And just keep a running list of of limitations, and then, you know, we could use that as the future road map. Yeah. Howard, is there a way we could do some strategic

### You (2025-07-31T22:08:49.017Z)

Pleasure.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:08:52.660Z)

screenshots

### You (2025-07-31T22:08:53.047Z)

Yeah, yeah, I mean, you could always put together a presentation,

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:08:54.010Z)

of the POC just so, like, maybe there's five screenshots that show that I I mean, just so that someone

### You (2025-07-31T22:08:56.127Z)

put together a presentation that could have static screenshots, you can also embed short videos in there. So

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:09:02.360Z)

can get the sense that

### You (2025-07-31T22:09:03.307Z)

so, yeah, we could just do a little quick, like, little five second demo of

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:09:04.170Z)

this is real. Right? There is a real product behind this, and it's not just us talking.

### You (2025-07-31T22:09:08.897Z)

something.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:09:09.820Z)

Yeah. That's a very good idea.

### You (2025-07-31T22:09:10.157Z)

In there, whatever you wanna show, or we can input it value and show how that calculation is in real time.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:09:16.140Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T22:09:17.987Z)

Yeah. We can do we can do something like that.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:09:37.460Z)

I think, you know, we learned a lot with the conversation with Alan, and it I think I mean, and thank goodness she's a friend. Right? And that was the purpose is that she's not gonna hold anything against us. And and, you know, we have the opportunity to talk to her more because of the strong relationships. I will say one thing though, while I don't think it really went fantastic. There was one thing that she said she was making it to be like and she's like, well, yes. But we have this in Excel, so it's no different. Different. But as I thought about it over the next twenty four hours, that's almost a positive in some ways because we set out to build a POC that's exactly like how we underwrite in Excel. Right, Mark? You've made that point over and over that this can't feel foreign to our users or they'll never use it. It's gotta feel very familiar. And so in that regard, I I think we are accomplishing that initial goal is that it does feel very familiar because it's exactly like an Excel underwriting tool. So I just I that came I mean, after I was reflecting on the conversation and just thinking about everything she said, that was one I know she raised it as a negative. Like, I don't understand what value this offers us. Beyond what we're doing in Excel. But in some ways, that was positive because it does show that we've been thoughtful in building it And it's exactly like a hotel underwriter underwrites. Yeah. That's that's true. Right. But I I think the one thing that we need to do is is explain why we're kind of reinventing the wheel and why we're taking the time to take it out of Excel. And, you know, what the long term what the medium and long term benefits are of doing that.

### You (2025-07-31T22:11:21.817Z)

And and I would rather have 10 conversations with people like Ellen than one conversation

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:11:25.400Z)

So I think that needs to be a bigger part of our narrative. Right. And you were mentioning that the data standardization and and I I mean, you were trying to get

### You (2025-07-31T22:11:29.067Z)

with somebody who's just gonna tell us how great it looks because you know,

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:11:32.990Z)

some of that at a at a and then I know the subsequent conversations.

### You (2025-07-31T22:11:33.237Z)

they're they're a friend or an acquaintance, We need to talk to more skeptics to learn what

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:11:37.400Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T22:11:39.467Z)

obstacles we have to overcome. So I I appreciate all of the stuff that Ellen was was bringing up.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:12:00.670Z)

Mhmm. And we could probably think about what more we could just to take the

### You (2025-07-31T22:12:10.807Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:12:13.730Z)

as, you know, kind of a feedback to make or add something which is not available in Excel in MVP version if we want to. You know, change That's a really great point, Vinod, and I was I don't know what made me think of this, but I was going back through you know, like, deal path and deal cloud and revere and just looking at their websites over the past couple days, one of them and I think it I I just don't even remember who it is at this point, but maybe it's Revere, has it that when you open up and like, a when you import an OM or financials, right, to your underwriting model, and it pops up, those financials pop up, and your underwriting you decide to pass on that deal, that's fine. You indicate in the software that you're passing. But there's a little button at the top that says save to comps. It's literally that easy to say, I'm gonna pass on this deal, but I wanna save this

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:16.227Z)

Yeah. Well, actually, Diane, doesn't have to be a button.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:16.720Z)

what's in front of me right now, these these historical financials and everything.

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:20.127Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:21.000Z)

To my to my comps database. Right?

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:21.457Z)

every one of the deals has a drop down list about

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:24.690Z)

And that would be something that

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:25.227Z)

status. And redIQ did the same thing. In fact, we had

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:26.890Z)

I I mean, probably wouldn't be that hard for us to put in the MVP

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:29.987Z)

people putting in more comp deals

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:30.600Z)

It's just I think it's just literally a little button.

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:33.007Z)

than deals they were underwriting. Anytime they underwrote a deal in a market, they would contact all the brokers that have similar deals get the OMs, and put them in their in their redIQ list, just so they had, just for that purpose. And all you need all you need is a little drop down in the status, and one of the options is just comp.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:13:57.130Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T22:13:57.367Z)

And you just select that drop down box. That's all you have to do. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:03.530Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:12.117Z)

Right. Yeah. Good.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:14.800Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:18.217Z)

And that would be a field on the

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:19.050Z)

Right. Because that solves the pain point, right, which is you're not run you're not

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:22.527Z)

pipeline as well. So you can group your comps together. You can filter them out.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:23.830Z)

you're not surf you're not searching your

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:26.837Z)

You only wanna see your deals.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:27.000Z)

shared drive to find the underwriting model that has that specific comp in it.

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:29.457Z)

I mean, we could do that. In in in ten minutes.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:31.220Z)

Which is very time consuming thing. And especially if you have analyst burn, it it's not effective.

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:33.927Z)

Basically just adding another option

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:36.100Z)

Effective.

### You (2025-07-31T22:14:37.627Z)

to the to that drop down list. So, yeah, that's that's something we can definitely do.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:14:52.160Z)

Right. Okay. Got it. And now flipping back to Drew and Mark, I know Drew, thank you for setting the time up. With Ryan. And now he's invited Dan And then you and Mark already talked about this probably yesterday. So what did you guys just decide on how you wanna handle that call now that Dan's joining. We we didn't necessarily agree on what we were trying to get out of this. And that got initially, request my objective was to circle back to the conversation I've had with Ryan many, many times about using his data you know, blending it with hotel BIS which is very similar to InnVestAI's approach of you know, location level data versus market level data. Right? Apply the market level data to the location, and you can do yeah. You can create valuations on the fly. So I was I wanted to circle back to that and and at least get some start getting some initial data from him that he's provided in the past so that we could use that to load into the system. I think with Dan in the mix now and Mark's conversation, with Dan the other day, about, you know, his enthusiasm for what we're doing and offer of potentially investing. It sort of raises the stakes a little bit. And so so we yeah. So, like, I I mean, Mark, do you wanna pick up here and and, you know, like, add to this? Like, know, one Yeah. I mean, my my preference my preference would be to just go through you know, we've been working on a little narrative power point. Maybe we use that on Monday. Just as kind of a high level explanation of what we're what our business plan is. Just to give them an overview and, hopefully, sorry? It it looked great. I didn't proof it. Like, end end to end. Does it need proof end to end? Or, Drew, did did the AI tool that you used pick it up and pretty well from the It definitely needs it definitely needs more work. But it's Okay. But that was really just the first draft. I think. Yeah. Yeah. It was meant to just take what Mark had put as far as the bullet points and put it into PowerPoint. But I think it is think yeah. We wanna sort of like, what we were just talking about with with pitch versus demo. Right? Like, we're gonna in this case, there's nothing we're not gonna demo to Dan and and Ryan. We are going to talk about the, you know, issues that we all know and that they know exist, And how I guess, like, how what we are developing is going to address those issues.

### You (2025-07-31T22:17:49.497Z)

Alright. So tell you what, I will go through the POC

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:17:51.120Z)

Yeah. I mean, I do like Diane's idea of maybe showing a few

### You (2025-07-31T22:17:54.467Z)

take screenshots of it from beginning to end.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:17:55.970Z)

screenshots. If we can pull that off by Monday.

### You (2025-07-31T22:17:57.337Z)

Then you guys can can decide what you want to use.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:17:59.550Z)

Only because it shows that it's real and that it is real. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:01.427Z)

Do you want me to put those direct

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:03.320Z)

We're not blowing smoke. Right?

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:05.797Z)

in a PowerPoint slide, or do you want I can just send you the

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:05.920Z)

Yeah. No. I I liked it.

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:09.857Z)

the or upload the images into a team site. So k.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:19.200Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:20.347Z)

Yep. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:28.280Z)

Just upload the images

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:30.487Z)

Yeah. I will.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:32.290Z)

because Drew did it in an AI tool, and so it might

### You (2025-07-31T22:18:32.817Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T22:18:35.580Z)

be versus you putting it in PowerPoint. It might be just easier for us to grab the images and use his AI tool. Yeah. Maybe just create a folder on the Teams drive we then Drew and I can go get them. Okay. And then, Drew, Mark, are we gonna talk? Before the Dan call, or how do you guys wanna work on prepping for that? Yeah. No. We should definitely do a dress rehearsal or two. Just to make sure we're all know, because I'm sure just as as we talk through it, we'll probably find things that we wanna add or subtract. So I think it would be helpful to do it either you know, tomorrow or you have if anyway if you guys have time, maybe late Sunday, that could work. Or Monday morning. Whatever you prefer. What time is the call, Drew? It is 10:30 Pacific time on Monday. So what is that? 01:30 eastern? Yeah. So maybe we could do it either tomorrow over the weekend just so that if we wanna make exchanges, we'll have time to do so. Great. Can we just pick a time for tomorrow so that, we don't have to email about it? The only thing I have is the noon call we have with the nodes team. So I'm really open tomorrow. You wanna do it right after that? Yeah. That that works. Okay. Alright. Got it. This Okay. And then the last thing is just a quick update. From networking. Right? And, you know, Carol Hansel, we've we've talked about her already, but she introduced me to a woman named Jessica Kramer. And Jessica has a pretty big tech background. She's also an attorney She worked for the Newport Group for a long time, knows Bob Webster really well. But she's more on, like, the revenue side of tech. She's working with the principles of the Sashi Group, which is owner man owner manager sponsor out of Silicon Valley. They own quite a few alofts and they own the hotel that's right outside of Google's headquarters. They're very tech oriented. They have a a tech fund She likes the ID Howard Howard was with me on the call, but it was literally it was, like, fifteen minutes. So it was very hard to get into anything. But she likes the idea. She wants to run through it with us one more time. But at this point, I think we should be And this was Howard. I mean, Howard feels really and that we should bring Mark and maybe Drew you into it as well so that we're she she wants us to block an hour of her time next week so we can go through it in more detail. There's good and bad here. I'll start with the bad, which is she does seem to be very focused on on, like, VC funding, which we might not be ready for. That said, the principles are the Sashi Group. Right? They're hotel owners and investors. So they could be almost like you know, Carlos Rodriguez junior or something like that. That mean, there may be a way for them to just direct you know, precede along the lines of with Dan and others. So so that that's the good piece is that it's not just a fly by night VC company. They're actually real hotel owners and investors here. So I will send you guys some information about them, about Jessica, about her company that she works for, and about the Sashi Group. If you guys don't I it was the first time I ever heard of the Sashi Group. They're West Coast based. And again, they're Silicon Valley based. And then I'll coordinate a time for us to talk to her next week. Yeah. I've actually talked with them before. One of their I know he's a partner. He works there. He used to work at IHG, I believe. And so he and I had some overlap there and knew each other from there. Had not talked since then. No. He worked at I think maybe he was at Kimpton. Yeah. He was at Kimpton, actually. When Kimpton was up. Acquired by I h They, yeah, they own some hotels, and they have but they have a lot of they're very tech focused. So I don't they never I I could I probably supposed respond to them, and I never did. But but, yeah, that I that's I have heard of it before. Okay. So, but it was a nice introduction that Carol made because this is definitely a community of people that we want to know and and keep a relationship with. Even if this doesn't work out for us on any kind of funding, their depth of expertise when it comes to pretty much like, the entire revenue universe of hospitality is it's quite impressive. So she's a valuable person for us to have in our network even if this doesn't you know, lead anything for us right now. There's no concern that they're gonna do this themselves. Right? No. No. I don't, I don't think they've even really thought of it. They've been very focused. Like like, all the technology and hospitality, it's all been revenue. Focused, right, or travel tech focused. This is the first time I think a lot of people are hearing the idea that there could be a investment focused technology play. So I I don't believe that but I mean, we can ask. We can sign it. We can have them sign a confi. That's no problem at all. I mean, it's not. To me. These that's probably we can't really ask to sign them to sign something I think it's I think we have just as long as you're comfortable, like, as long as I'm comfortable. Yes. I I am comfortable. That's probably good enough. Yeah. And and, like, the fact that just I mean, I was just when she was giving me her background, the fact that she's also an attorney really just interested me. And then one of the other things that I when I was going through I think it's called Infinity Ventures, is the tech arm of the Sashi Group. But one of the things they have kind of in their tech map or their their interest is digital identity. Which is something that I believe has huge crossover into the real estate space. It's almost and I'm pleased because I'm not a tech person, so the tech people on this call are probably gonna roll their eyes when I say this. But maybe a little bit in concept like blockchain. Right? Is that we're using the star code right now as the code, right, to connect all of the data. And digital identity is trying to do something similar so that in the in the revenue space, like, right, the Expedia sites, they they all have one common code that they can source back to the hotel or the asset. But that has huge opportunity in real estate as well. And there are folks that are looking at how to patent that in real estate. It hasn't been talked about in hospitality except for the HLA. They've been talking about it also more from a a a revenue and rep and travel tech perspective. But I'm rambling on that, but I think that could be a really huge thing that we haven't talked about and could be a a monetizable opportunity for us. So anyway, I rambled, but that's that is the update the Sasha Group. Very good. So we'll talk tomorrow at noon. And then
