# Transcript for: InnXchange POC review

### You (2026-02-02T16:14:17.894Z)

What happened was the Google what was happening when you tried to log in?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:14:22.850Z)

I could see the link on my phone but not my computer, and I thought I would just dial in with my phone. And then I downloaded the Google Meet app, but it wouldn't let me. It wanted me to set it all up. And so the setup was taking too long to be able to just get to the call.

### You (2026-02-02T16:14:46.454Z)

That's strange, because usually you should just be able to go right to the Google. Link without having to download. The Google Meet app. I. 'm on back. So I don't have a Google Meet. They don't make it for Mac, so I just use the web version.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:15:03.810Z)

Oh, okay.

### You (2026-02-02T16:15:05.334Z)

Either way, this is working. So should be all fine. Let me double check. We're back. Okay? All right. So how's your week? End.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:15:17.730Z)

I worked. How was your weekend?

### You (2026-02-02T16:15:22.374Z)

Same. Got. Caught up in trying to. Replace my brakes over the weekend.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:15:32.770Z)

Oh, my goodness.

### You (2026-02-02T16:15:34.694Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:15:35.810Z)

All your car issues. Your daughter's car issues. You're right. Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:15:35.974Z)

Turn into. This is something. It's just been put off. For way too long. I ended up. There's one of those things where. I don't know. I think I'm jinxed. It's like anytime I try to do a project, There's always something. It's like, okay, got to go back. And this was the same way. I got the driver's side done. I was just doing rear brakes. I got the driver's side done. Went fine starting all the passenger side. All went fine. Took the arms off, put the new ones on. And the very last step is to install. What they call the. Caliper. Which has the piston that goes back and forth. So when you push on the braking. Well, the piston was frozen. It. Would move. And. When that happens, you have to replace the caliper, which is not a big deal, but I didn't have it. When they say you should do it on both sides, don't just replace one. I have to go. And take the orbit off the driver's side. Which is working. But still want to replace it passenger side.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:17:02.050Z)

I hope you have a nice warm garage to work in for that. Otherwise, that would be brutal in the cold.

### You (2026-02-02T16:17:08.694Z)

I don't, but I do have.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:17:10.210Z)

You were in the cold doing that outside.

### You (2026-02-02T16:17:12.934Z)

I've got some space heaters. I like the setup going there. I did like, a space heater on each side. So it really wasn't bad. I was okay, but yeah. It was just one of those things where I thought, yeah, this is just going very well. Everything's popping in, looking good, until that very last thing. I'm really done this car. I'm just going to go back out there and spend the afternoon. Finishing it up.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:17:43.410Z)

That's good. My afternoon is. I'm going to get the deck cleaned up. I didn't have a chance because I was at Crowgirl weekend. I didn't get a chance to work on it. But I think I can get it cleaned up enough for Sloan. And then, because I sent it to you, and my uncle, but you guys didn't get it. So I'll resend it to my uncle, and then I'm sure he'll have a lot of really positive feedback. He's great to work with. He's very upbeat, and he delivers criticism in a very positive way so that you can hear it so. And I sent you a link. There was an interview done with Ben Rafter from Hotel equities and why I have him. I've said this before about why I have him on my radar screen is like Carlos Jr. He's just a person that's very technology oriented. Right. And he's built to startup companies exited successfully. He just might be a good advisor for us. Someone for us to talk about. Art, you know what we're doing, the issues that we're running into. I don't want to call them issues, but you know what I mean. The data extraction. And if there's a better way. To go about that. And then potential introduction. Or not an introduction, but a client testimonial. Back to atelier. To see if I can reengage Ali in a conversation. So that's the method of my networking. Math on that.

### You (2026-02-02T16:19:13.734Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:19:14.610Z)

And so Sloan, Sloan is just, again, he's a person who's very focused on technology. He's on the operator side, but he's done capital markets work, too. He's an actual COO or CEO. I don't know what his former title was, but pretty senior. And so we pitch really well together. It'll just be pitching in this new environment with a new name and a new POC and a deck and things like that. And without Mark and Vinod, sadly. And without Drew in the mix.

### You (2026-02-02T16:19:52.854Z)

Y. Eah. Okay?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:19:55.810Z)

So where do you want to start?

### You (2026-02-02T16:20:00.534Z)

Quick review. Of. The poc. So let me bring it up. Okay? Looks like my computer. Scrolling a little slow, so just let me know when you can see it.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:20:37.010Z)

And you had a good conversation with Vinod. It all went well, I gathered from the email. Happy to do any of the technical work through GitHub to transfer whatever we give to Drew. Conversation, or was it just all on technical stuff?

### You (2026-02-02T16:21:01.574Z)

No, it's just about the process of what's going to happen when we get everything signed.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:21:07.570Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-02-02T16:21:08.934Z)

I want to make sure that originates the email. That I can just forward to him and say, okay, because here we are, everything's signed. It'll probably all go through me and, like. So I'll forward it to him. He'll make it public so they can access it. Send me the URL. We'll just have to go back and forth. It'll be fine. He doesn't have any issues. I did during the conversation, just kind of quickly insert something like, I don't know if you've been talking to Drew or not, but this is what we're. Just because he skipped over quickly and he picked up. Yeah, he said, no, I haven't had the guidance spoken to anybody about this. I just. Want to get it over. He's dealing with anything there. It's probably not likely that he would entertain coming back right away. After things settle down and we can show some progress. Whether it be additional funding, whatever's going on. Maybe. A. Reconsider. So we'll see.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:22:34.930Z)

And do you? Because it was hard with Sherman on the call. Sherburne was pretty adamant, like, no. And I know Vinod is angry at me, and I honestly have a little frustration. Going back as well. Just because of how? Kind of like quick and short the ending wise. But I trust you completely. And so is Vinod someone you want to come back? Is that a positive thing? Or do you think it's better to try to move forward with a different software engineer?

### You (2026-02-02T16:23:13.894Z)

Yeah, I would like him to come back. I. Don't have any concerns about. Him returning. Don't understand Mike's point of view. And I think I mentioned it before. That's why I like that. Your hands, these conversations. With people who may already have the technology. I really think, in my opinion, it's really important at this time that we need somebody who has experience in startups, whether it be, was it Stacy that had the experience?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:23:58.450Z)

Y.

### You (2026-02-02T16:23:59.814Z)

Or maybe this other general that you mentioned. But we need somebody. Whether. They have a founder's equity position. Un. Ite do not. Have the experience necessary to get this thing off the ground. But where the subject matter experts. But we.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:24:19.730Z)

Eah.

### You (2026-02-02T16:24:22.614Z)

Have never created. A SaaS organization from scratch. I think a trade of equity in exchange for somebody who can just cross the T's and dot the I's would be very valuable. But I also think that. In Option B would be to partner with somebody who's got. House technical experience. Already. Could be a very similar situation where. They. Get. Some revenue share, a little bit of equity. I mean, it could be strategized some way. I don't. Know that we would want to. Be. Totally. Locked in. To somebody. With some type of a non compete, but I guess it all depends on who it is. Where they've got a complementary product, not competitive product. That would be great if we just become a. I won't say subsidiary, but.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:25:39.650Z)

Sister company or something like that, right? Yeah.

### You (2026-02-02T16:25:42.374Z)

Like that. Where? We could certainly provide services to their existing customers, but also allow us to go out and get our own. Which. Again. It would help for a marketing standpoint. It would help with technical standpoint. It just becomes, rather than a standalone. In exchange. We. Partner with somebody. So the question becomes, do you want 100% of a million? Dollars, or do you want 50% of $10 million? Right.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:26:21.970Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:26:24.854Z)

I'm not saying it's guaranteed, but you might be able to generate more revenue. That. Way. Definitely faster.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:26:37.010Z)

I really believe you can.

### You (2026-02-02T16:26:40.454Z)

With either of those. How. Would the node fit in? I think, obviously, if we were to be able to piggyback with somebody who has already got. We just need somebody who can do the document processing. And I think you mentioned otel. He's got that data. They can do know somebody like that.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:27:00.690Z)

Hear? It.

### You (2026-02-02T16:27:03.254Z)

We can then just almost be a client of theirs, even if they can process it and then have somebody. Build out the model. I don't trust. Club code is good. It's way better than the lovable and everything else out there that I've used before. I hear stories about people who build enterprise production. Apps using Claude code. But. I don't think there's somebody like me who doesn't code. I think they're coders who use club code. And then do whatever they need to do to make it an enterprise. Which that's always an option, and I think. What was happening with the node. Is that a bloodborne? Because I used lovable at first. But I think they were just basically rebuilding what we had put together using all the documentation that they weren't using, the code that I put together. In just making changes. Which. I don't hear the same comments about people who he was lovable or bold or replic or those other non coding tools. They're great for individual apps. But. To make it an actual production app that could have multiple users using it at one time. They're just not there. So I think almost the bottom line is I think what I've put together in Claude Code would be much, much easier. For a full stack engineer to come in and just do what needs to be done to have the security. What I put together will never get a sock to compliance, right?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:29:03.090Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:29:03.494Z)

So something like that for the future and build it out to have the single sign on and all of those other things that are not part of the valuation model itself. Put together.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:29:18.530Z)

Yeah. And I really, I mean, this is a journey. Right. And you told me this in the past, that how you think it's going to play out, it'll probably play out completely different than how you think it's going to play out. Right. So right now where my instinct, after a year of us trying to do this. And everything we've learned is, let's go back again and try atelier. And if that doesn't. But I want to hear someone like Ben or Sloan, I just want to be able to dialogue with them about it. Does that make sense? What about this? What about this? What are their thoughts? Because I'm working with imperfect knowledge as well. But then my second option would be Hot Stats, only because it was acquired by Duetto, who is an actual SaaS workflow automation platform. Right. And they're going to be looking to grow. And I like that they're in the UK already as well. It gives, you know, two world regions in one where Atelier is really in the United States only, although they have a very large tech team in Sri Lanka. And atelier. I really, really like Matt Curry. If we could get him, who's moved on to now? Be the head of sales and marketing for another company. But this is a big opportunity and I would love it. He and Ali have worked together. Right. So I see a lot of synergies there. But I'm going to go first as atelier. Second is Hot Stats. Third is Calibri, which is a woman. Named Cindy Estes Green. I don't completely. And then the fourth is M3. Was acquired in part by Blackstone half ago, so they can process their data as well.

### You (2026-02-02T16:31:03.734Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:31:15.730Z)

Not star data, but P and L data. So those are my four options. And again, Sloan and May have a lot of. And Pranav. Right. That's the other person we have to go back and circle. And you've not met Pranav, but he will have a million ideas for us. Once you and I kind of get the flow of this 2.0. How we're going to talk about it. Like how we kind of how we present the future, how we present the DAC, how we present the failure of the 1.0 try that we did last year and things like that. I'm not sure. I mean, I honestly don't even know how to start it from just a five person startup after the past year. And the one thing I'll say is I see a disconnect with Sherben a little bit on that because I think he thinks this is a very small lean startup team where everyone has really big equity percentages. And I see it more as I'm willing to give up. A lot of equity. If we can bolt on to a company that has a ton of this infrastructure so that over the next three to five years we could grow domestically. And I know this is a really bold statement, but internationally, I really believe that we could grow internationally because of the way that Berends are structured across the globe and the unity that the hotel industry has. Kind of just, you know, as starting out is like, I'd like to try to hit in the next month or six weeks if we can. You know, these options like, you know, we talked about. We talked to Sloan, we talked to Pranav. Then we say, okay, who's first up, second up, third up, fourth. Opera, try to keep all the options open. And I would love it if Vinod could return and be a software and maybe it would be a better fit for him to be a software engineer. In. A sister company, right, that has all those resources versus being true. Total startup like. Yeah, okay.

### You (2026-02-02T16:33:31.334Z)

100% certain is he will not come back for the flood equity. Like he was doing before. If we are sufficient funding to pay him a salary, that could be what would change the whole thing.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:33:47.170Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-02-02T16:33:50.454Z)

Okay. Are you seeing my stream?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:33:51.090Z)

All. Right, so now. I am.

### You (2026-02-02T16:33:55.334Z)

Pipeline, okay? Just kind of give an overview with standard look too much like the old one that I would not want to take this from the market. Something different with the sideline here. But we did change here. We've got to add. We've got the search in here. So I can just type in, if I want to buy a Hotel California, I can just go ahead and do the active search there. I will be entering button here you can choose what columns. You want to have and then what order which is active? Grouping. You can roop by the different items here. You can save it. If I have quite a few different properties in a particular city in your state or property type. By the id. Ome. Net. Up filter over here, which is redundant with button, has to go away, so we already have the filter over here. I just haven't removed that yet. Adding new is different. So if I click on here, this looks like the one that we were working on that never completed so got here properly managing the address, et cetera. I don't think that's going to let me continue without putting in the names, but there are modal. That I went through before. So I. 'll remember information, et cetera. I go through and change the orders in a way to make. It. More. So much better. And at any time. Looking. Into continuing. Like your original. Or if I ever want to go back and modify it, I can go to whichever four pages. Up here you can see page one, one, two, three and four. If I just wanted to change the interest rate or something, I can go back and change it and then close out of wherever I am. For example, I can just bring one up. Okay, here's something else different across the When I put my cursor over. I can either go into the valuation. Or I can edit the details. So if I added details, it's going to come up here and I can go ahead and click on go to the next page. I don't have the low number, so it's not something I need to. Put in the number Borrower. Diane. You're contact information. There are the required field. I'm here, so now I can go. Say the next. Same thing for word amount, or I could assume we can close it here. Should just say whatever I put in there. Go through the valuation. If you keep an eye on that left hand navigation. When I click on the Valuation tab. When it opens up all of these assumptions. Penetration, revenue, expense, et cetera. Those are not visible if you're just in the pipeline. If I go back to the pipeline, these all go away. This page. Because I haven't done anything with uploading and extracting the data. So this is the same coding information we had before. Variation functions is complete. I did quite a bit of reforming what I'm here. So anytime I change any information on here, it's going to go back and change everything in here. I don't have information here, so it's not calculating the IRR or anything. And these cap rates are if one type of situation. If I have. An input here. For my purchase price. And I have on the exit. It will calculate your acquisition right now, right? So this is not going to be based. It's the same 5.1 as I have over here in the cap rate. On my exit cap rate. Same thing. I have a 7 to 0. But if I were in change the valuation, penetration analysis and everything else. Were my cash flow is different. My ending cap rate might not be the 7%. It could be 7.126 or whatever. And then whatever that calculates will display in here.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:39:14.610Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:39:14.774Z)

We'll go through all that. Right. So there's no ir.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:39:16.690Z)

One thing to just one thing just to mention is when you're demoing this hotel cap rates tend to be in more like the 7 to 8% range. And I know multifamily is much lower, more like 4ish range. I just wanted to mention that because. Because just like multifamily Right. We live and die by cap rates. Cap rate. I mean, if I go back through my career, cap rate would dominate my dreams, right? And so, but it's like hotels are in the 7 to 8%. I mean, maybe you get to a 6% on a luxury asset in New York City, you know, that, that has a ton of cash flow, but I just wanted to mention that because it is a bit different than multifamily. It's just much higher because of the risk.

### You (2026-02-02T16:40:03.574Z)

On going to get. Into level detail tomorrow. It just takes too long. But just for more information.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:40:10.290Z)

But you'll show the screen, right? Because this is a great looking screen.

### You (2026-02-02T16:40:12.854Z)

I'll go through the stream and kind of show a couple of things that might change.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:40:14.850Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-02-02T16:40:18.134Z)

But for example, here, there's a little error coming here. So if my inductor equity doesn't add up to 100%, Either. Come on. Here. Change that to 80%. And then it goes away. Or maybe the only 50% and I might. Have another partner that has 30%. So I have to add up to 100%. That's one of the things in there as well. I got everything lines up better. Everything is much cleaner than it was before. Penetration and revenue. Pretty much the same thing. I've been working a lot on these changes, making sure that the nearest work correctly. So whatever I input here on the valuation assumptions for my. Whole period in Europe will follow through to here. Historical. I mean, what has not changed? I think the inputs visually. I want to change source. That will probably just be like, maybe colors or something like that. Higher point at the arm of everyone. To look a little bit like Excel. So that it's not completely new, right?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:41:39.650Z)

Right, so.

### You (2026-02-02T16:41:42.534Z)

There's no way they can come back here and say, oh, we've got IP on. This is no different than what I would do in Excel.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:41:49.730Z)

No, this is the hotel industry. Done this for 45 years, so.

### You (2026-02-02T16:41:56.854Z)

I can see in Revenue on this page, just like before. Expense analysis, same thing. One thing more to smile with as I tab through here the column, same place. Very little change between the two because of some column with information here. So much cleaner. As well. So now you can go through and before on these sessions were expanded and you have to scroll up the way down so you can make it a lot easier and see if you want to just collapse all these. Get down here and listen to a lot of search engine before if I have an exit sales price if I go through all those for five years. Of the whole period, then I will be getting my irr. My cash on cash, et cetera. But right now, this is basically where we are to show. Reports. Same thing. I haven't changed anything here. This is the same. Occupancy report, document upload, some of these things. I need to make some visual changes, form level changes. But that's it. And then if you're an admin, you have this user management tab here where you can go and add and remove users there. But if you're not, then this doesn't need a display on the page there.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:43:30.690Z)

Okay? I had one when I was in last week. Can we go to the penetration analysis? Was a term that. So that's the pipeline. And then the penetration analysis. I feel like I saw something that was called penetration occupancy ADR. RevPAR. Can you go down to that revenue line that's at the very, very bottom? I would have sworn I saw. No, I guess I'm crazy. Someplace that we should have labeled adr, we were labeling revenue, but I don't see it here. That is revenue. So it's. It's. Oh, wait, there it is. It's on your tabs at the top, key metrics. Occupancy revenue expenses. Does that make sense? And let's click on revenue for a second. So that's occupancy, that's revenue rate. Okay, maybe what it is is on occupancy. Because we always think of everything as occupancy, ADR, RevPAR. Right? It's those three things. And you know, now, ad nauseam, since you've done this, occupancy times ADR equals RevPAR. So by calling this occupancy and it's the penetration and analysis. We just call this penetration analysis. Or maybe we call this. I don't know what to call. Does this make sense? Because click on the revenue tab.

### You (2026-02-02T16:45:02.694Z)

Are things to the Tam room.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:45:05.330Z)

Yeah, it's just right, because it's more of an occupancy, right? It's, it's, it's like all of the 80, you know, occupancy plus, you know, times ADR equals RevPAR. And then the revenue is the other revenue. It's the right, it's. Or no. The revenue is the ADR, the RevPAR. So maybe revenue becomes market penet, like penetration analysis or something like that, but.

### You (2026-02-02T16:45:37.494Z)

Penetration allows attempted occupancy. Avian revpar.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:45:41.970Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:45:42.694Z)

Which is what? Pun the revenue adr rev power. Separate occupancy for this section here.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:45:53.090Z)

And that's the one thing that's a little different about hotels is we never look at occupants like. Like other asset classes look at occupancy independently. We always look at the occupancy and the ADR together. It's like they're always. So that was my only suggestion is.

### You (2026-02-02T16:46:06.134Z)

Okay, this is needing to change. And I would like to. Anything that we can change from the original. I think it was better. If you want to just go through here and jot down some notes.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:46:23.490Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-02-02T16:46:24.774Z)

Email them and let me know what you should do. I can go ahead and do that. That's no problem.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:46:32.850Z)

And I did look at it last Thursday. I spent some time in here. Can you also think about just because you spent more time in here, one of the pages of the Pitch Deck should include a few screenshots from the poc. And I just if you could just kind of think about what would Screenshot? Well and what could in maybe three visuals that on a slide, you know, maybe it's like where you put all the inputs on the deal, like the equity, the debt, the, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah. The penetration analysis.

### You (2026-02-02T16:47:09.414Z)

We can do. Like the pipeline, where they can see me list of all their properties. And a couple screenshots here. I want that stuff. No problem. Can easily do that.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:47:19.970Z)

Okay? And then something I was reading about. Dealpath is. And I can't remember the name of what they're calling it. It's called DealPath AI something where they've now negotiated a deal with CBRE and JLL to get the listings directly loaded into Deal Path. We should. We should pitch that a little bit with Sloan tomorrow, too, because they've already accomplished that. With CBRE and jll and I realize that's deal path and not us, right? But hotels are always the lowest pecking order within any brokerage house. And so if the precedent is set, Then if we have the best product for people to see deals and data, I think we could get the brokers to do it and just say, well, look, you do a deal path, right? So we're custom built for hotels. So do this. You know, we want, we want to replicate that for hotels so that the loading like, basically, they're sending automatically and loading into an exchange all the deals that they're marketing.

### You (2026-02-02T16:48:29.414Z)

Plan for the marketplace portion. So if you have a marketplace where we can take a look at what they say. If I'm a broker.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:48:32.930Z)

Yes.

### You (2026-02-02T16:48:38.534Z)

We will be in place somewhere in. Here, whether it be in the pipeline or in the valuation. Over here on the side, something that says, sure, deal. So I can go through and complete everything and get my investment summary. So I would have my market comps filled out that I hoover the broker. All of my assumptions for the cappers, and then basically I would get the valuation, then I would click on here and I would share this. And I would have two options. I can share it with everybody. At which point, Hope Hill, California, is now in the marketplace. So if I'm in a lecture. It would basically. Be anybody from using. Thus or. Excuse me, any change? Would be able to see it. Or they can do an off market. Deal. Where I might just say, okay, I know Diane is looking for this type of property, so I can click on that, share and just share with you.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:49:42.370Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:49:50.934Z)

We went in one with a commission. And so how would you showed a deal with you? You click on it. Everybody has the confidentiality agreement with a broker. Sure is. Right here. Multifamily. They're not going to be like all of you. We can have the console of geometry. Don't tell them PDF. Click it. I will agree. Push the button. Boom. You go to your pipeline.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:50:06.130Z)

Yeah. No, we do, too. Yep.

### You (2026-02-02T16:50:17.734Z)

And you can hook out California or have something in here, let's say, is it shared? My name on it. And then you can go in here. And say, yeah, I agree with the cap rate here, but I think I can get a better interest rate going to your changes to it. We're not changing what I have on my. Account. But it's my word here. You can change whatever you want. Theoretically, as a broker. Have. Done 80, 90% of the work, the same goal and tweak it. 's just a ton of ways that you can do this and monetize it. You can cause $2,000. To fly to on the marketplace. Or maybe $2,000 plus 5 bits on the purchase price. See what it closes.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:51:26.050Z)

Yes. Yes. Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:51:28.454Z)

One thing we can do. We can't guarantee that our investor client is going to get the best bid. I might get involved with somebody else, but we could say that we can definitely accelerate the deal. Because if I share this with you and you just end growing tweaks and assumptions, you could get at least to the point to generate the loi.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:51:35.330Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:51:55.734Z)

In a few hours and then contingent.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:51:57.570Z)

Right. And the loi gets generated from inside of this app as well. Right. Is like. You got it. Right. We're using AI to generate and speed up that process. And then the comparison of the Lois is in here. Right? Because people.

### You (2026-02-02T16:52:14.534Z)

Everything could be contained within this environment. You could generally run around physical obstruction, blah, blah, blah, blah. Would be interested.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:52:25.330Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:52:25.734Z)

What are before email going back and forth and to be over there too. I've got this document section where I as a broker, I can upload all of this documentation in here. And I can share this as well, right?

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:52:40.690Z)

Right. And boy, would that be helpful because you know, as someone who you have to go out and get three bovs and then the broker's email them to you and you're going through and comparison comparing that. Right. And it's. It's been a while since I've done that, since before I used AI on a daily basis, but still, there's just so much opportunity here. And when we pitch, I guess as I go through and I read, I feel like every day, like, how to write a successful pitch deck is we may not have traction because this doesn't exist in hospitality yet, but this exists in real estate, right? Like it's deal, path, deal cloud, Archer, Rediq. Like this, like, it. The traction is in that it already exists and is commercially successful in the broader CRE space. We just don't.

### You (2026-02-02T16:53:35.014Z)

It exists, but not to be sent away. There's nobody that like this with the valuation model.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:53:42.610Z)

Right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:53:45.254Z)

Having a marketplace where you as an investor and a broker can connect. That's great. But yeah, you still have that normal process of. Okay, great, I'll send you off or click on the button. You can download this button. Still have to go into Excel or whatever. Marveling copy and paste. Don't take two or three millions to go through all this. Two or three hours. So that is starting to make. That's the differentiator between. Us and anybody else.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:54:23.490Z)

And when we pitch to Sloan or when we pitch to anyone, it's the unique partnership that you and I have. Right. And that you understand technology and broader cre very, very well. And I understand the workflow processes and hotel capital markets. And so while and I'm just going to put Sherburn to the side because Sherban, I mean, that's nice, what he does, right? Like. And like you and I from here, right? You have the ability to work with a tech technology team. I have the ability to go out, and I. I do sell, try to raise capital, work with Pete Bright, and that's what we're. Pitching is this unique partnership that we have. And I say that over and over again, because anyone that I put as competitors within the hotel industry that's doing operational asset management. And I'll just use Drew, for example, right? He's not our partner anymore, but he's living in his own little. Operational asset management world, right? And he's not living in the world of capital markets, which is. It's different. And that's what you bring to the table, is that that knowledge of what everyone else is doing, right? And having, you know, real page and, you know, Yardy and all those things that are going to be important for us long term that Drew wouldn't even realize.

### You (2026-02-02T16:55:19.174Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:55:47.570Z)

How important perhaps a potential yardy workaround will be for us in the future. Okay? Okay, great. So, Tamar, I'll send you the pitch deck once I get it final. Ly tomorrow morning. There is a slight chance Sloan cancels and reschedules. He's done that to me multiple occasions. He has a new baby. Her name is Esme. And so. But if. But he's a good person. And I know he'll get it rescheduled if by chance. And I also am going in my search to get to my. To get to Ben Rafter. I reached out to someone I know at Hotel Equities. Joe Reardon. And so Joe is making an introduction as well. So I'm going multiple angles to try to get to Ben. And then we should think about once we get through this pitch, then probably the next person is Pranav at Driftoid and go back to Pranav and talk to him and just. Lay it all out and get his thoughts on it is probably another step in the next week or two.

### You (2026-02-02T16:56:56.294Z)

That makes sense.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:56:57.010Z)

Okay? All right.

### You (2026-02-02T16:56:58.534Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:57:00.450Z)

Peace.

### You (2026-02-02T16:57:00.854Z)

All right. I'm excited to be back.

### Guest (2026-02-02T16:57:04.850Z)

Yes. Yes, I do, too. I'll be glad when it's. Well, I'll be glad when it's done. All right. Bye.

### You (2026-02-02T16:57:05.254Z)

Okay? All right, we'll see you.
