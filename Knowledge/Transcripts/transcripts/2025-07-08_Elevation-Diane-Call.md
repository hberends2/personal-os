With us and listen to, like, what we built and see a little bit of it. K.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:06:04.970Z)

Sounds good. Nice meeting you, Howard. Yeah. Nice meeting you.

### You (2025-07-08T18:06:09.089Z)

Likewise. Just to kinda give you a little bit background, I actually have been in commercial real estate for more than thirty years. About fifteen years ago, I got bit by the technology bug. So I was previously vice president of asset management at BH Management Properties and director of business intelligence at Bell Partners. So with a lot of the bigger organizations out there, but then I went to, went to the dark side back around 2010. And haven't haven't looked back since. You know? I just I just love the technology side. But Nir, I've I've worked with Waterton for for quite a few different gigs. I was with RealPage for quite a while as well as some of the

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:06:53.310Z)

So you don't know Rich Hughes?

### You (2025-07-08T18:06:55.519Z)

he is? Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:06:56.750Z)

Rich was my college roommate.

### You (2025-07-08T18:06:56.859Z)

And Rich was my father. Terrific. Very cool.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:06:59.670Z)

Of the

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:00.489Z)

Very cool.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:01.010Z)

yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:01.199Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:01.980Z)

He's he's high up in RealPage. Right? He's

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:03.729Z)

He is. He is. He's

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:04.850Z)

what a nerd. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:06.009Z)

he's quite the data scientist there. He's he's quite the the quant. Yeah. So, but, yeah, I mean, Waterton was a client of ours on the utility management side and and also with Red IQ, I believe, there is a group of Waterton that are using RedIQ. And I will preface that pretty much all my experience on the real estate side has been in multi family, But hotels, I mean, NOI is NOI. Right? It doesn't doesn't really matter what to what what the building looks like. So, excited to join Diane and and work on this and appreciate, the opportunity to speak with you.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:46.580Z)

And awesome. And, Howard, Red IQ, just so I I was

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:48.539Z)

And having that I was trying to

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:51.370Z)

trying to

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:51.409Z)

get the and take

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:51.910Z)

Dan, thanks for sharing. I was trying to kinda get situated. Red IQ,

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:52.759Z)

pain for sharing. Was trying get good sense of it.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:56.520Z)

allows

### You (2025-07-08T18:07:57.529Z)

Folks like Washington, Underwrite,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:07:58.090Z)

folks like Waterton underwrite

### You (2025-07-08T18:08:00.289Z)

fields, like,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:08:00.880Z)

deals. Like, they feed an OM and and

### You (2025-07-08T18:08:01.799Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So Red IQ probably about eight or nine years ago. Actually started by a couple of investors who are just really frustrated with getting the the financial documents, rent rolls, etcetera, from all these different deals in different formats. So the first thing they did was create basically an AI or machine learning tool that would ingest these documents and then put them in a singular format. So you could take something from Yardi, another one from RealPage, another one from Entrada, but at the end of the day, when you're working in RedeyeQ, everything is formatted to your chart of accounts, and the rent rolls are all there. Then they expanded into more of creating their own underwriting model It's primarily Excel based. They've got a couple of Excel connectors. But they they've they've kind of been leapfrogged in the last couple years in terms of some some other organizations that are coming out there making more use of of AI. You know, Red IQ is a very good workhorse. And, you know, I kinda call it the blue collar underwriting tool of of the multifamily because it does a really good job on processing the invoice or processing the rent rolls, processing the financial statements. You still have to kind of do everything in Excel at the end of the day. And so we've got some other competitors out there that that started to bring in AI. Using using AI to process documents where you know, with Red IQ, we were confined to a rules based or rules engine. So it says, okay, I've got this document. This document has these columns and it has these rows. I can see that that's a real page rent roll. And it will then extract the data. But if somebody does any change to that rent roll, right, if if it breaks the rule, then it gets kicked out. It has to be manually changed. Or manually processed. Whereas you know, AI doesn't look for data to be in a specific row or column. It'll go back and say, oh, here's a column that's obviously the unit number and this and that. So that's really started where I started to really dig into the AI usage and and getting into more of a machine learning rather than a rules based processor. Red IQ was sold by Berecadia to Radix last August. Good company, bad timing. Yeah. With with some things going on outside of Radix's control, they basically, shut down the shop. At the January. Which is then when I reconnected with Diane. And so all of those initiatives that I to apply to the multifamily side, we get to do it on the hotel side.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:11:16.350Z)

So RedIQ is no more?

### You (2025-07-08T18:11:16.679Z)

So that's just important. They are still there. But they basically got rid of all of the engineers. They put it put it this way. Everybody was let go except for two of the client service people and two junior engineers, basically, to keep the lights on. They haven't been doing any additional modifications or enhancements to the platform.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:11:41.400Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-07-08T18:11:43.699Z)

And that was simply because, you know, radix found themselves involved with that real page class action lawsuit. And so they had to take all the resources and redirect them to the radical side, so RedIQ just kinda you know, rode off into the sunset there. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:05.700Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:05.939Z)

yeah. And then it's probably

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:07.410Z)

And then as Howard mentioned in the interim, there have been a handful of multi

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:08.109Z)

in the interim. That are kind of been a handful multifamily that have really leapfrogged and

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:11.660Z)

family AVMs that have really leapfrogged, and we've done demos with

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:14.259Z)

done demos with some of them.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:16.280Z)

some of them. It's pretty amazing to see where they're going.

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:17.489Z)

To see they're going. I I

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:20.350Z)

I I think we feel a little bit fortunate that we're creating this at the time we're creating it

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:20.929Z)

a little bit fortunate that we're creating this the time we're creating it. Because online

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:26.020Z)

online and and Howard, this is your your

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:26.529Z)

and hired zero a year ago. Kind of your

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:29.600Z)

kinda your your expertise, but we won't be saddled with some of the legacy

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:29.729Z)

view. Expertise. But we won't be settled with some of the legacy technology issues

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:34.390Z)

technology issues that Red IQ was saddled with because of the time that we're

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:35.309Z)

that Red Oak was settled with because of the time that we're starting this right now.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:38.820Z)

starting this right now. And so we have a better

### You (2025-07-08T18:12:40.209Z)

And so we have a better I think, ability to use. And I don't wanna overstate how

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:12:43.510Z)

I think, ability to you and and I don't wanna overstate how we're using AI right now,

Where they are more of a deal management, pipeline management. Platform. And we did have people who were using Rede IQ for the document deal path simultaneously for the pipeline, but I would say Archer has probably been the most impactful on Red IQ. Over the last, probably couple years. But there there are others out there that are still doing very well on the AI side. They probably aren't as large as RedIQ yet, but they've been

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:14:08.830Z)

fifth management companies announced against each other. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:15.290Z)

So our, like, our vision is

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:15.469Z)

our like, you are visioning in fast forward a couple of meter.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:19.110Z)

fast forward a couple of years and

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:21.279Z)

And are industry

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:22.570Z)

our industry no longer exchanges deal data by, like,

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:22.909Z)

will know. Changing. Steal data by by emailing Excels

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:27.210Z)

by emailing Excels and PDFs and, you know,

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:28.549Z)

and PDFs. And you know, and upload.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:30.590Z)

and uploading to broker, box sites.

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:30.839Z)

To break. Box. Sites. It can all

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:34.350Z)

It can all be digitally

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:34.529Z)

be digital. Transferred

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:36.350Z)

transferred directly into InnVestAI, which again is a pipeline management and AVM put together. That's gonna take change management on our part. But if you look at what DealPath did,

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:36.569Z)

directly. To your investment transferred that's the pipeline put together be changed. Put put did, what they launched,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:50.590Z)

when they launched, they got Blackstone behind them, and it took the ownership

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:52.569Z)

Blackstone. Took kind of

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:16:56.750Z)

community to kinda push it along, if this makes sense.

### You (2025-07-08T18:16:57.319Z)

pushed it along. This makes sense. Because

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:00.400Z)

Because no broker really wanted their deal you know, displayed in an Expedia like format with every other group's

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:08.359Z)

deal.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:08.860Z)

deal. But the that that has actually changed too over the past

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:09.389Z)

But that that has actually changed too over the past ten years because

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:13.320Z)

ten years because Lightbox just bought Revere and so you're starting to see more

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:13.909Z)

Lightbox just bought Revere and so you're starting to see more centralized

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:20.820Z)

centralized have you guys used Revere?

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:21.719Z)

Have you guys used root beer by chance at all to look up your eye?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:23.840Z)

By chance at all to look at I've seen I I've I've used Revere. It's one of the brokers or maybe two of them. When you sign Confis at the warehouse diligence.

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:35.499Z)

Appreciate

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:35.630Z)

So I for sure, did not use the full capacity. It's just a standard

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:38.909Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:39.700Z)

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:40.709Z)

Done. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:42.750Z)

Right. So kind of our vision is we essentially

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:42.789Z)

So can I we essentially call

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:46.660Z)

we become the central processing

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:47.629Z)

cross? Processing. Plant for all of

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:49.620Z)

plant for all of that.

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:50.739Z)

that. And

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:52.390Z)

And with the built in AVM, right, so that we're

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:53.589Z)

right so that we're capturing all of

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:56.040Z)

capturing all of that data.

### You (2025-07-08T18:17:56.659Z)

of that data And

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:17:58.810Z)

And then, my

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:00.169Z)

my

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:01.190Z)

my goal or hope is within five years,

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:01.649Z)

goal hope. Is within five years we have

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:05.650Z)

we actually become a marketplace ourselves

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:07.099Z)

marketplace our ourselves, And we're

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:09.530Z)

and where deals transact

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:09.739Z)

just trying transact And that

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:11.920Z)

And that may sound absolutely crazy, but when I was at

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:11.979Z)

is how the absolute increase. But when I was at CBRE,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:15.750Z)

CBRE,

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:17.089Z)

they

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:17.280Z)

they actually had thought leadership on the fact

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:18.259Z)

had back. That commercial real estate

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:21.640Z)

that commercial real estate

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:22.959Z)

on both

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:23.890Z)

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:24.669Z)

of this

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:25.590Z)

leasing side and on the real estate side,

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:25.809Z)

side and on roof. Side. But that what would happen in

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:30.120Z)

eventually, would happen is there would be third party

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:31.049Z)

they third party intervene.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:33.140Z)

intermediaries where the transactions actually took

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:34.039Z)

Where the vector actually took place. And brokers were

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:37.240Z)

place, and brokers would serve just more of an

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:38.469Z)

surge more of an strategic role

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:41.110Z)

of a strategic role, right, in marketing and creating the

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:42.449Z)

right, and marketing and creating the competition.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:45.330Z)

competition.

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:45.349Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:46.580Z)

All of the data and the data management would

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:46.699Z)

data and the management would actually be

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:50.020Z)

be done via a third party

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:50.109Z)

done via a third party side or third party

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:52.970Z)

site or third party platform.

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:54.029Z)

platform. And

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:18:56.020Z)

And on the leasing side of the office business, that's already happening with the VT

### You (2025-07-08T18:18:57.869Z)

business. That's already happening with BTS.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:00.990Z)

VTS has a marketplace

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:01.119Z)

BTS has a market place platform platform where

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:04.700Z)

platform where they're actually charging per transaction because

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:05.039Z)

not charging. Per because they're facility

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:09.010Z)

they're facilitating all of the data and the

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:09.089Z)

all of the data and that will the data

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:12.360Z)

the data flow. So

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:12.579Z)

flow. So I

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:15.040Z)

I'm not sure. On that note sorry, Dane. On that note, you you used the Office

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:16.049Z)

Just start. Know.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:20.120Z)

In the office sector, v as in Victor, t as in Tom, s as in Sam?

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:22.579Z)

Office sector. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:26.440Z)

Mhmm. They they are now the they control the all the information. So if it's Cushman and Wakefield, Mark a deal or if it's CBRE marketing a deal, everything sits in VDF. VTS. On the leasing side. Yes. On the leasing side.

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:41.649Z)

On the

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:42.600Z)

Not on the sale side. Not on the sale side. Got it. Right.

### You (2025-07-08T18:19:45.489Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:19:46.400Z)

But what I did wanna clarify is that when CBRE did this research and what they did it for is they were trying to decide if they wanted to invest in VTS or they wanted to invest in CoStar. Because CBRE writes big checks.

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:00.119Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:00.950Z)

And at the time I was leaving CBRE, they wrote a check

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:01.449Z)

I'm

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:05.370Z)

for a 125,000,000 to invest in VTS just

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:07.289Z)

in ETFs just for that reason.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:09.410Z)

for that reason because so much of their business

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:10.119Z)

Because so much of is off. Occupied.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:12.700Z)

is occupier based. Right? And they saw the future of what VTS

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:12.999Z)

Right? And they saw future. ETF. Do. And

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:17.130Z)

could do. And so,

### You (2025-07-08T18:20:18.179Z)

we

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:20:19.840Z)

we and I say we loosely. Right? But

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:00.905Z)

All here.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:01.890Z)

So, Howard, can I turn that over for

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:02.865Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:05.120Z)

for you to just talk a little bit about? Because you're better ex ex

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:05.565Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:08.650Z)

explaining the technicality of that.

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:10.985Z)

Yeah. It's in fact, let me go ahead and Diane, are you the host of this?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:16.710Z)

I will try and do this

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:18.845Z)

Sorry. To. This and make you the host. Oh, okay. Yeah. I was gonna say I'm not sure.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:20.230Z)

and make you the host.

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:23.025Z)

If I if I can share my screen. It'll be a

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:27.130Z)

You could

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:27.155Z)

lot easier. You said

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:29.780Z)

You're set.

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:30.475Z)

Alright. Alright. So looks like I am sharing the screen. Do you see the the web page? Welcome to InnVestAI.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:27:49.760Z)

Yes. Yes.

### You (2025-07-08T18:27:52.895Z)

Yep. Yes. Alright. Alright. Well, good. So so I will walk you through and give you the the high level path of what we're trying to accomplish here. So hotel industry, just like multifamily and just like everybody else, they are very much in bed with Excel. Everybody uses Excel. That's how I got involved in tech. I was I was an Excel guru. I could write VBA code. I can do all of this stuff, and I created some incredible budget templates and forecasting templates. And so that's when RealPage asked me to join back in 02/2005. To help build central reporting. And that's, you know, really what I wanna do. But one thing that I know, since I know Excel so deeply and intimately, I also know how dangerous Excel can be. Right? One slip of a finger or somebody hard codes cell that used to have a formula. You know, it's error prone. It's not secure. There's there's all sorts of things that we wanna do. And, know, everybody's model has 20 tabs at the bottom that they've to keep flipping back and forth. Here's this tab for this. This tab for that. Just a lot of inefficiency for one. So what we're trying to do, number one, is to reduce the amount of time that an analyst is spending in Excel. We try to automate as much as we can. What I'm showing you today is not where we want to be in terms of automation. We will be implementing things very similar to what I did at Red IQ, where you can drag a file, even, you know, take take a financial spreadsheet, whether it's a PDF, whether it's Excel, drag it, drop it, we process it and pre populate as much as we can. So you got all your historical data ready to go. And all you then need to go in there is put in your assumptions for your forecasts. And then, of course, we will be incorporating other things like, you know, generating AI summaries, creating investment committee reports. I mean, all this information like Diane was mentioning earlier, we're trying to be the portal the the tool, that has all of this information that you need, And with my experience in asset management, I also want to make it cradle to grave. So from the very first time, I become aware that an investment is for sale, through the acquisition, through the entire life cycle, through the disposition. We want to be able to use InnVestAI for that. So sounds lofty, but when you take a look at it, that whole core of financial statements star reports, all of this external data can easily be consolidated. And that's the core of the product. It goes into a database. Other things like the reporting and everything else, that's a pretty simple add on. So we'll be working on that. So I'm not going to go through every single step and input numbers. I'll show you, you know, it it is a working model.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:31:21.520Z)

Right. It's a proof of concept.

### You (2025-07-08T18:31:25.825Z)

It is it is

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:31:26.190Z)

So, like like,

### You (2025-07-08T18:31:26.895Z)

of concept. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:31:27.280Z)

right.

### You (2025-07-08T18:31:28.105Z)

you know, initially, you're gonna go here. You're gonna put in the property details. The the basics. Name, address, ID, which is also the star number, you'll see where that comes into play here shortly. But you put in, you know, the rooms and keys. Property type, full service, select service, convention, extended stay. You know, we wanna be able to to excuse me. I didn't mean to click off that page. When we are when when we are gathering this data and when users are inputting this, we want to be able to aggregate the data and be able to show, okay, I'm buying a hotel in Downtown LA. We want to be able to show you all of that data from Downtown LA. Right? And we want to make it apples to apples. We want to make sure you are comparing the same property type to aggregated data of that same property type. Other information that we can upload here But the next screen, I think, is pretty exciting. So when you are going through your forecasting, there's multiple ways of getting into the weeds. Right? Many people, for example, food and beverage. They might just might just budget at the very top line. Others may want to get down into more detail. So, you know, this particular this particular deal may have a casual dining restaurant and room service. Right? So as I click these items, these then are going to be what I would actually budget for in the pro form a. Now, this is our future state. Today, we can go at the top level. So you'll see when I go through this that you can you can forecast your food and beverage on a on a per occupied unit. Or per occupied room. Percentage of revenue, or you can just type in a number. Right? So you can do that for these major other income groups and expenses too. So if I select an item on here for the revenue, it's also gonna do the same for the expenses. K? Once I've clicked in that, I'll I'll click in. I don't know. Somehow I jumped to the wrong tab. So let me go back then. So the next step would be your market data. And you this probably looks familiar to you. Right? So if I input that census number, the star report, you know, ideal situation is we're going to be able to pull that information. Into the report. I have even loftier dreams for this. I'm not gonna get into the details, right now. This could be, you know, a year or so down the road, but I think we can come up with a product that will give you the same information that you can currently get today. On demand You don't have to wait a day or four days for it. But that's where we'll get this information here. If I wanted to edit anything, I could edit here. I could delete it. I I could make any changes that I want on this page. We also have a page for operating statistics. And this is basically where the where the the analyst, whoever's putting in the numbers here, might call around and get some information. From some of the cops. Right? So Right.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:34:46.000Z)

Right. So can I pause for a second? This might be where, like, you're underwriting a courtyard

### You (2025-07-08T18:34:47.835Z)

Right. Right. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:34:50.670Z)

or maybe, let me just say, Lowe's or something like that, like, in Midtown. Right? Any call around all your friends at Marriott and Hilton or and get the the the individual information. Do you guys know what I'm talking about? And so we wanted to make a placeholder for owners

### You (2025-07-08T18:35:02.275Z)

So folder for or whoever.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:35:06.470Z)

or whoever's underwriting to

### You (2025-07-08T18:35:06.815Z)

Holder for

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:35:07.950Z)

put that information in here and access it.

### You (2025-07-08T18:35:08.625Z)

whoever's. But

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:35:11.640Z)

But we at InnVestAI we would never go access info right, Howard? Like, this is gonna be information

### You (2025-07-08T18:35:11.685Z)

we need to it that's get right.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:35:18.330Z)

for you guys. We will pull up and anonymize information that comes directly from a very credible source right, through Drew. But this is more like your own holding place for all of those comps that you call around and get, but are pretty important to us in hotel underwriting.

### You (2025-07-08T18:35:37.905Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, you know, if I have this comp and they say, okay. Well, I'm I'm looking at twenty twenty four here. I can input that. Is it for the fiscal year? Month to date, year to date? I can choose there. You know, maybe they have 250 available rooms, and they're occupancy is seventy two point five. And my ADR is you can see it will automatically calculate the the RevPAR based on the information here. But you can see. I can go through, and I can input all this information And here I can take my notes, and this is what Diane was referring to as well. So this is this is me as an analyst or an underwriting underwriter. Putting in this information here. We include two rows here, but I can add as many properties to this as I want to. You know, so this would be, you know, hotel hotel one go on on and on. And you can add multiple years to this if you want to as well. The third thing is

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:36:40.810Z)

And then jumping in one second too, and then I'm sorry. But just so you guys have the

### You (2025-07-08T18:36:42.115Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:36:45.090Z)

background on this, is the all the multifamily AVMs are doing the as well, but where I actually host actually said they wanted this feature.

### You (2025-07-08T18:36:51.805Z)

Said they wanted this feature. When I talked to them.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:36:53.920Z)

When I talked to them about

### You (2025-07-08T18:36:55.225Z)

About their intelligence

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:36:56.290Z)

their data intelligence and, like because they're the leader, right, in what they're doing,

### You (2025-07-08T18:36:57.295Z)

and, like, a leader. They

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:37:00.720Z)

They said the one thing we hate is having to scrounge around our network for all comps that we collect, and we would want a central holding in place.

### You (2025-07-08T18:37:08.175Z)

place. For all of those.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:37:09.010Z)

For all of those. So this actually came this

### You (2025-07-08T18:37:10.185Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:37:12.330Z)

idea came from one of the leading hotel investors in in The US.

### You (2025-07-08T18:37:15.825Z)

The US. And we're trying to

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:37:16.700Z)

And we're trying to incorporate it

### You (2025-07-08T18:37:17.275Z)

operate it.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:37:18.540Z)

We are incorporating it into our our platform.

### You (2025-07-08T18:37:19.195Z)

It. Into our our platform. And the third is transaction summary. If the user wants to keep track of other hotel sales, that are comps to this particular deal, they can go in and put it here. So they can input, you know, what property sold, when did it sell, fill in all the information here, who was the buyer, who was the lender, etcetera. And just like on the other ones, you know, I can add as many properties to this page as I want. But like like Diane mentioned, you know, these are for internal data for the users. What we're going to be focusing on is this market comp page and fleshing this out where we can automate this, you know, some of it using, you know, agentic AI to go out and get information for a particular area. So I can just put in the name and address of a hotel, and then I can come to this page and I can find all the competitors listed here. And I can then check a box which ones do I wanna include in my list, etcetera. You know, so that's that's, again, kind of the long term plan for that. So the next step in the journey after I have the mark data in there is I'm going to go to this valuation page. And you can see right now, so starting from this point on, we're going to have some metric cards up at the top here. So every time I change a number, it's going to go through and change the calculations so I can see the effect of what I'm inputting in real time. Now, for the proof of concept, this is hard coded up here. You're not gonna see any changes. But down here, you can you can change there. So if I take my discount rate and let me put the cursor where I need it to be. I change this, you know, to 10%, or excuse me, 10% I guess I can't hit zeros right. Acquisition costs, lenders fees, etcetera. Estimated CapEx and the reserve, you know, all of these are gonna start changing down here. Financing as well. Right? So if my loan to value is 60%, not 65, you can see it's not working right now. So this is this is the good thing about proof of concept and working on your own laptop. It might not be connected.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:39:43.650Z)

Oh, good.

### You (2025-07-08T18:39:44.825Z)

So, anyway, the the numbers here, you can see, the the idea is when we get to the

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:39:48.450Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-08T18:39:50.935Z)

the MVP. Anytime we make a change here, it's gonna change the related information down here. As well as the the the cards up here. Now there is one thing that we are changing based on feedback as well. Right now, your lender fees or your loan fees this is based on just a percentage of the total loan. But one thing that we're doing here is and hopefully, I can move this without yeah. There we go. Okay. This is a a version that I'm working on right now. In fact, I'm this this part over here, I worked on this morning. So So for lender fees, for example, we want this to be as versatile as possible. And so I can choose. Do I want to base it on a percentage of loan amount? And you can see as I increase the number here, down here, my lender fees, down here are gonna be changing. So I can go through and increase that, decrease it, Or, some people like to get into the weeds. And I can choose detail. In which case, now I can no longer use this, but over here I can start in putting things. So, you know, maybe there's a, 50 bips point on the origination fee. And so as I input 50, it shows here. And then down here, for my lenders fees, every time I change that, up here, it's gonna go here. So maybe the underwriting fee might be, $5,000. And how it goes up. You know? So so here I can go through, and there's a large number of items here. So if you like to get into the weeds and and and get everything right down to the line item, you could use this modal as well. Right? I would suspect that over the next few months, there's going to be a lot of things like this. As I start to talk to clients and and see how do they do things, Is there a better way? Do we want to make flexibility in here? I mean, we you you you temptation is to be you wanna be everything to everybody. Which you can't always be. But you know, I I think we have enough experience on our team to know what would be the best practices you know, of of how to do this. And so somebody may come up with a suggestion and it might work for them, but it's not going to work for everybody else, then obviously we wouldn't incorporate that in here. But jumping back then, let's go through this real quick. You've also got your exit assumptions here for your cap rate, exit sales expense, etcetera. And then once you've got the financing and all of this information down, now you get into the pro form a. And so you can see those those cards will always be visible up here no matter what page you're on. We also have a table here of key metrics. That will always be visible as you're going through. So anytime you make a change in this model, you're going to see the impact immediately. You don't have to go to a different tab on an Excel spreadsheet or you don't have to make all these changes. It's real time every time you push a key. So you can see we've got some key metrics here with occupancy, ADR, your total revenue, gross operating profit, EBITDA, and and and percentage as well. You've got occupancy numbers up here.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:43:17.700Z)

Recording stopped.

### You (2025-07-08T18:43:17.965Z)

And you've got your revenue and expense breakdowns here. If I wanna see my total other operated, I can expand that to see my food and beverage. So, you know, a lot of this information is going to be right in your face. The whole time you're working on this. And then down here on this section of the pro form a, you've got your penetration analysis, which is your occupancy and you know, you can click on this to navigate directly to the section you want. But it it essentially, you know, when you upload your historical documents so when you get information from the seller, from the broker, and you've got the financial statements, in this particular example, we've got four years of historical financial data loaded up back in the property details and the market or excuse me, the valuation section. You know, it's set for a five year hold period. So essentially, these four columns are going to be static data that you've gotten from the historicals. And I'm gonna be trying to forecast everything out here. Now, the subject property occupants, you know, if I change this to ninety, you know, you can see the immediate effect up above if you take a look at the 2025 revenue, etcetera. Some people want to budget year over by year over year growth instead of actual occupancy. So I can change that here. And now I can come down here, and I can say, you know, maybe I want 2% growth in year 2025, 2026. I'm gonna be fixing up, doing a lot of renovation. So I expect it to be a 5% bump in every time I change it. The numbers up above here change as well. Immediate effect there. Scrolling down again. I would again, I think I'm getting too much into the weeds. What you can see here, So, you know, for the for the ADR growth, very similar to above can just one flat growth that's applied across all of the future or I can input each one individually, however I want that. Down here, the revenue, you've got your food and beverage revenue. Other operated, etcetera. Like I said, it's gonna be at the high level, not actually drilling down into, you know, the the the individual line items.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:45:34.720Z)

At this point, be at the proof of concept

### You (2025-07-08T18:45:35.315Z)

Perfect. That's it. We absolutely will be there for the for the actual

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:45:39.150Z)

Right? Yep.

### You (2025-07-08T18:45:40.285Z)

model. Right? But for today, this is where we are. And then the last thing I wanna show is on the expense side, for example. I mentioned earlier that if you want to to budget by per occupied room, I've got the POR selected here. And what it does is it takes my historical information here, that was uploaded, divides it by the occupancy for that year to come up with the preoccupied room. So I can then continue here, and I can, you know, maybe go 24. 25, 26. Everything goes that way. I could go by percentage of revenue. And when I change that, now it's taking the food and beverage and divide expense and dividing it by by the food and beverage revenue And so there, again, I can do the same thing. I can come in here and and change the numbers, to calculate forward. Or maybe I just want to manually input it. So I've got all of the numbers here, and then I can say, you know, I'm expecting, you know, 1,407,000. Etcetera. Right? So, that's that's how we'll be doing the expense section all the way down. To as Diane mentioned, we're we're all the way down to capital expenditures. NOI. So you can budget all of the undistributed expenses, your nonoperating expenses, and then in capital, you can also come down here and, you know, put down you know, I I need to replace the roof. And I'm gonna do that in year one, and it's gonna be know, $350,000. And I can continue down here. Just put it in whatever the applicable row is. And just like with the other items, you know, I can just keep adding these items as I need to. And they'll get your total CapEx down here. But you know, when when this is live, you know, like I said, these these cards right now are sample data. But all of this information calculated on the fly. And I can get to where I need to be. If I've got thresholds or if I've got hurdles that I have to to address, In in version one, would go and make the manual changes. In version two, when we start incorporating more AI, It could be one of those simple things where I could just click a button down here and say, what can I modify? In this in this pro form a in order to accomplish a cash on cash return of 18%. Right? Boom. You let the AI go and make their recommendations. Coming down here then, the reports I already showed one tab there. You're going to have many more reports based on the information that we have here. This one is, the market occupancy report. So again, you see your historical information here. And then you've got your subject property, historical and forecast. And whatever you input in the model is going to be here. There will be a summary page also. This is under construction, but this would be something where you might have six or eight different quadrants where it will have more detail into the cards that you see here. So you've got an IRR of 12.5, Well, the summary will include a little bit more detail in here, something that could actually be printed out And then the items that I'm working on also right now is we will be able to upload documents in into here. So it could be a central repository of any document that's associated with this deal. You can upload them here. And then the waterfall would be your distributions. You know, whenever I when I sell this property, what are the distributions to the the the various partnership entities, etcetera. And calculate there. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:49:41.730Z)

So I'm just gonna go just jump back in. This is a proof of like, we are purpose building this you guys.

### You (2025-07-08T18:49:47.275Z)

your

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:49:47.810Z)

Right? And so we want

### You (2025-07-08T18:49:48.715Z)

feedback. We want the hotel

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:49:50.280Z)

your feedback. We want the hotel industry's feedback

### You (2025-07-08T18:49:50.755Z)

industry's feedback. We ourselves.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:49:54.740Z)

because we don't wanna get too ahead of ourselves. We want our road map to be the

### You (2025-07-08T18:49:55.465Z)

Our group. Map. To be. The features you really want.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:49:59.710Z)

features that you all really want.

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:00.245Z)

But we're in this in this, like, we go back

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:03.000Z)

We're just stuck in this in this like, we go back and forth and back and forth. It's like,

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:03.415Z)

to the. Like, it's

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:07.940Z)

this may be a little too early to give well, it is too early to give to an analyst.

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:08.035Z)

too early. Give to an Right. But we need people

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:12.910Z)

Right? But yet, we need people I mean, we need, and I'll just say I need it, but we at InnVestAI need

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:21.555Z)

to send okay.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:22.770Z)

help from our friends to say, okay.

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:23.135Z)

We'd like to like this. We saw

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:26.040Z)

Like this. We don't like this. Or have you thought about

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:26.435Z)

just sense. Like, I'm thought about

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:29.400Z)

this make sense? Like, have you thought about going to these five people to

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:30.275Z)

people. To see if you could raise some capital. To get to.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:33.890Z)

see if you could raise some capital to get to the MVP?

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:34.135Z)

The end. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:38.080Z)

You know, we might want really like, for you guys,

Help us.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:41.430Z)

or if you have an analyst to really come in and help us, like, develop what

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:41.885Z)

Like, develop what tool what the input should look like

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:46.370Z)

these

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:47.115Z)

with the app.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:47.550Z)

tool you kind of what the input should look like, what the output should look like.

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:48.955Z)

Feel good about to a real proof of concept

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:51.290Z)

But we feel good that we're getting to a real proof of concept

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:52.035Z)

that show this is viable. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:54.790Z)

that shows this is viable

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:55.235Z)

A feature for you guys

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:50:57.010Z)

And a feature for you guys, and and this is what I

### You (2025-07-08T18:50:59.665Z)

you were at Waterton. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:00.840Z)

I would want is, like, near when we were at Waterton, right,

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:02.815Z)

And you're still doing it. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:04.130Z)

you would need to go out, and you're still doing it ablation.

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:04.765Z)

go off. To 10. Potential capital partners to capitalize

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:07.390Z)

Go out to 10 potential capital partners to capitalize your deal.

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:08.765Z)

your deal. We want this to be your command center.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:12.360Z)

We want this to be your command central

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:14.355Z)

To people. To run. Directly.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:15.560Z)

you can send this to people directly from InnVestAI. Right?

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:15.775Z)

From it's and

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:20.530Z)

And you and and you no longer have to do all of this via email.

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:21.345Z)

yet. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:24.810Z)

So there will be controls and people and and the CR and a a

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:25.855Z)

CRM and the source. Sort of. But

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:29.750Z)

CRM of sort built into this.

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:31.615Z)

free.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:31.990Z)

But, again, this is purpose built for you guys. It's purpose built for lenders. Purpose built for brokers. And while like, some of us hate it, it's purpose built for appraisers too. So that

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:42.405Z)

Yeah. Full process.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:45.640Z)

yeah. We just we improve the whole process.

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:46.155Z)

Caught overwriting.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:48.400Z)

Overriding question on all of this is because we

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:49.425Z)

You know, do.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:52.220Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:52.625Z)

I want some of this

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:52.980Z)

Yeah. How do you deal with confidentiality on some of this data? Right? We sign that

### You (2025-07-08T18:51:58.695Z)

future state.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:51:59.000Z)

the current state. I'm not talking about the future state and all that. You sign a confi.

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:03.885Z)

You

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:04.370Z)

You get the data,

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:05.175Z)

or, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:05.720Z)

And

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:06.035Z)

to get travel. Research data.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:06.840Z)

you or, you know, Smith Travel Research data,

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:10.515Z)

To CoStar.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:10.640Z)

I may or may not subscribe to CoStar. Who once I upload it here, who owns that

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:15.965Z)

Visit? To you guys.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:18.110Z)

data? Is it do you guys then in the background have an aggregation benefit? Or or how are gonna We'll tag team this. The first thing is the owner always owns the information. Right? It it always belongs to the owner. And then like other platforms and I feel like we're lucky in the hospitality industry that we have Calibri and

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:40.825Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:41.690Z)

Star and Hot Stats. Right? So we and and Drew has this with his clients. Profit Sword has it. We will enter into a use agreement that with the owners that allow us

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:53.505Z)

We

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:52:53.670Z)

to aggregate and anonymize data. We will never give any individual hotel information out

### You (2025-07-08T18:52:58.945Z)

anyone

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:53:01.460Z)

to anyone. It's not gonna be calling CBRE to get benchmark

### You (2025-07-08T18:53:02.315Z)

part of the data. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:53:05.400Z)

or data, right, where you have to have lockdowns on this that are completely solid.

### You (2025-07-08T18:53:10.765Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:53:11.040Z)

But we will enter into, like, a usage agreement with the owner who's sharing the data that gives us the right, again, to aggregate and autonomous. And if they don't want to, that's fine. You know, that's fine. But we believe that our industry can get past that And then, Howard, can I turn it over to you about more, like, how red eye handled some of the confidentiality on the deal part of it on your side?

### You (2025-07-08T18:53:33.485Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So in terms of confidentiality, security, etcetera, Every user will be set up, you know, will have an account at the company level, then we'll have the the users within that organization. And and so, of course, you'll have to have your typical username, password, you will not be able to see anything outside of your organization. Period. When it comes down to the data aggregation, what we did at RedeyeQ and what other companies in the space have been doing, which I think is the the the best way to do it. Is you simply opt in or opt out of data sharing. If you opt out, then none of your data will ever be put into the aggregation database. So the aggregated database is a totally separate database from the working database. Okay? If you opt out of sharing, that basically means you won't have access to the aggregated data as well. So those products that we'll be offering where you can compare your deal other deals or bring in market data from other areas know, wouldn't be available to you if you're not sharing your data. So that in order to get access to that, you have to you have to share your data. But if you you know, I've there are organizations that I've worked with you know, even at RedIQ that they just have a policy. They they do not share data. Period. And and that's okay. And that that's fine. We can still work around that. You can still use

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:55:13.520Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-08T18:55:15.075Z)

the tool. You can still input your own information like I showed you. But like I said, we we will get to the point where, you know, some of the agreements that we're working on right now with other third party data vendors and the other data that we'll be ingesting. From the users. Going into that aggregated data, I think that's really the benefit falls into. Know what I showed you today was kind of jumpy, You know, just kind of going around different things here. But, you know, the bottom line is you know, even the core tool is gonna save a tremendous amount of time And like RedeyeQ, we're not saying that you can you know, let head you know, reduce head count because now they can instead of doing two deals a week, they can do 10 deals a week. No. The objective is you need to get more deals in front of you and weed through more. So you know, instead of going through that 10 deals a week, now maybe you can look at 40 deals a week. Pre screening. Right? Just

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:22.040Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:22.115Z)

let's do that really quick. And then then the other data there is is on top of it. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:26.900Z)

And and your vision on Star just on Star in particular, is example because we used Star so much. Are you thinking

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:37.865Z)

much.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:39.350Z)

you enter into that agreement with Star in the background, InnVestAI and Star,

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:44.565Z)

Access to this number down

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:46.420Z)

and you will have access to the STAR data.

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:48.645Z)

Yes. So start

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:50.120Z)

Or how would that work?

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:50.545Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:51.730Z)

Yeah. So star is the tricky piece. Right? Because CoStar doesn't like to

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:52.205Z)

With the, like like, nine. So So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:55.410Z)

play nice in the sand with anyone. So if you're looking at an

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:55.555Z)

if you're looking at an app and you agree,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:56:59.660Z)

acquisition,

### You (2025-07-08T18:56:59.985Z)

side that the

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:00.600Z)

and you agree with the comp set that the seller has and the broker has presented,

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:01.745Z)

in the front. We will be able to pull that

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:06.610Z)

we will be able to pull that up from the operator right, and pull it directly into InvestAI.

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:07.145Z)

Right? And pull it directly it. Right? If you decide to

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:12.880Z)

If you decide you wanna look at another comp set and you order that comp set

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:13.085Z)

set, order that help set, three. Set

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:17.850Z)

through Star, that's gonna be a we just

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:18.095Z)

be be a

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:20.930Z)

can't get around it. That's gonna be a little bit more manual of a process. At least initially, unless they start to work with more, with more technology companies. But you'll probably have to go

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:29.615Z)

that.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:31.910Z)

get that from Star and then drop it in the box and then we upload it.

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:36.575Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:39.090Z)

But Drew, like, for his asset management clients,

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:40.035Z)

client,

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:43.900Z)

like Starwood Capital, he's pulling all their star data directly up

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:43.935Z)

date and the rest. So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:47.820Z)

from, Profit Sword. So

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:48.435Z)

thank So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:50.840Z)

you can do that for a deal too if you if you agree with that comp set.

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:50.965Z)

too. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:55.150Z)

Does that make sense on on the difference?

### You (2025-07-08T18:57:55.525Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:57:57.590Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I know we're getting close to the top of the hour, but we will con this is, like, a big thing, and we're, like, we're you know, we've been working on this for four or five months. But by year two, we will need to consider two compliance because if we wanna work with the Blackstone's and the Brookfield's and the MetLife's, you know, we're probably if you look at the commercial real industry, DealPath has SOC two compliance.

### You (2025-07-08T18:58:25.945Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:58:26.030Z)

Red IQ has SOC two compliance. And so it I mean, we're not ready to think

### You (2025-07-08T18:58:28.935Z)

But will most likely

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:58:31.000Z)

about that yet, but it will most likely be in our road map. To, be able to scale this the way we think we can scale it.

### You (2025-07-08T18:58:36.125Z)

Yeah. No. It it is it is absolutely on the roadmap. We we need to get that done of the database partners, some of the tech partners we're looking at, they they are SOC two compliant. They they can help us get their Another thing that I wanna mention too is Red IQ did not support SSO, single sign on. And and we had many, many clients that were just about demanding it. So luckily, myself and and especially even though our the engineer that is working on this, he's very experienced in in single sign on. So we expect to have that If not, right on day one, very shortly afterwards because I know that is going to be a huge benefit to everybody. It's a benefit to us, and it's a benefit to you not to have all these different usernames and passwords lying around. There, again, that's also from a security standpoint, knowing that you are logging in under your SSO. And that nobody outside of this particular domain can get in or see the data, etcetera. So, And you have a

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:59:44.010Z)

And, you guys, I know we're at the top of the hour, and so our time is up. But, again, I'm just gonna go back to the fact I trust you two probably more than I trust anyone in the industry. Right?

### You (2025-07-08T18:59:52.305Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:59:55.240Z)

So

### You (2025-07-08T18:59:55.505Z)

and think about

### Guest (2025-07-08T18:59:56.250Z)

I mean, maybe you guys could just take this and think about it a little bit, and we can have a follow-up call where you could share your ideas with us. Because we need friends right now. And I wholeheartedly believe this product

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:10.715Z)

better.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:11.000Z)

will make our lives so much better. But I need to call on our friends to kind of help us figure out how to get from this is a good proof of concept. Get funded, with pre seed funding with a whole lot less than this is. But we just need to figure out how to go about it, and we need our smart industry friends

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:35.205Z)

Us. That.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:37.080Z)

to to help us with that, to help us give up ideas. Diane, what do you think you charge for this when it's all said and done? We need to work on that because right now, it's

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:44.535Z)

Now

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:48.160Z)

all AI is going to dramatically change

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:51.275Z)

Right? So right

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:51.870Z)

the pricing of these tools. Right?

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:52.635Z)

now, or see

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:55.010Z)

So right now, they can be user based or seat based

### You (2025-07-08T19:00:55.385Z)

based. Or

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:00:58.930Z)

or something along those lines. They also if you look at, like, deal path or I'll I'll say Juniper Square. Right? Because if they also have they call it T shirt pricing. So small, medium, and large. So, like, there would be a price

### You (2025-07-08T19:01:08.295Z)

small. Medium. Large. Like, they're be a price for another automation because

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:01:13.810Z)

for an elevation because you're a small sponsor shop. And then there would be a different pricing for, like, a Blackstone, right, who's an enterprise user. But the that will change as we develop the AI features and try to understand the value that the AI features are incorporating. And then, eventually, I go back to the idea if we can become a marketplace

### You (2025-07-08T19:01:40.375Z)

click.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:01:40.450Z)

then you know, we

### You (2025-07-08T19:01:41.395Z)

Or something. That we're

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:01:43.040Z)

like, closing costs are something that just used to. Right? I mean, when you're dealing with a $50,000,000 deal or a $100,000,000 deal, closing cost of 20 k or 30 k, that is really not that much. So if eventually we can actually become a marketplace where we are pricing because we're we're providing all the data and, like, know, data processing fee, if we're pricing kind of like a closing cost, I I think that could help us help the industry as well because then you're capitalizing some of the

### You (2025-07-08T19:02:14.815Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:02:14.830Z)

cost. Does that make sense in a in a much bigger yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so that There's lot a lot to think through. Yeah. A lot to think through. And I will say, you know, Jake and I have been playing with chat I have been taking on chat GPT at Jake has been taking on Claude. I think that fits our personalities. Not sure about I like that or not, dude.

### You (2025-07-08T19:02:38.585Z)

Well, I'm a I'm a clogged bed. So, Jake, I got you back on this one.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:02:43.050Z)

But Okay. But but we've been and I think, you know, I will say the

### You (2025-07-08T19:02:47.455Z)

So for

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:02:50.720Z)

from from him being more skeptic, I think, in general, we've been skeptic on this, but I've been between those two, I've been a late adapter, but earlier than he has. But we've both seen the tremendous growth that's happening, and the commercial, the widely known AI and not necessarily in the weeds and the stuff that's happening and some of the more

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:10.625Z)

have stay.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:12.310Z)

niche sectors. And and just there over the last twelve, eighteen months,

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:12.795Z)

Months. Has been amazing.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:16.610Z)

has been amazing to launch and to think about that within the context of what you're showing here and how that can grow. So I commend you for taking that. And they and I reminiscent of when we first talking when you were at CBRE thinking about all of that, even if you and I'm sure you've thought about it going back. How much the world has changed in a handful of years. In terms of what's out there and resources.

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:36.735Z)

So I guess I I said on top of there is

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:39.830Z)

So

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:40.155Z)

stuff to take up with

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:40.410Z)

I guess I I say all of that because

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:41.235Z)

your today.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:42.470Z)

there is stuff to think about what you're saying today.

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:45.835Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:45.850Z)

There's a lot to think about with

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:46.935Z)

It

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:47.500Z)

where will this be

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:47.635Z)

two years. Have you?

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:49.220Z)

not

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:49.975Z)

Twenty years in general.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:03:50.090Z)

in two years' time.

### You (2025-07-08T19:03:51.725Z)

connotation toward this product. Can't truly be. Yeah. Whatever else

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:04:00.190Z)

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:04:12.490Z)

### You (2025-07-08T19:04:41.715Z)

cap rates of those. We do plan to have a guided for just

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:04:46.300Z)

We do plan to have API integrations with Procore on, like, capital cost,

the hotel

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:02.760Z)

the hotel investment industry's very niche LLM.

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:06.245Z)

will apply

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:06.740Z)

That no one else will create, but that will allow our industry to use

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:07.165Z)

industry to AI garbage.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:11.530Z)

AI

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:12.595Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:12.780Z)

because it's garbage in, garbage out. And so But I guess I will ask you I I will ask on that because that's as I think of it, and I hear you speak it, and I and the reason I asked early on about how all these other

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:21.715Z)

these other sectors are

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:25.320Z)

sectors are dealing with this, I mean, Calibre Labs have made a living out of controlling that

debt. Way.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:30.760Z)

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:41.565Z)

Real

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:43.090Z)

the way that they've how do you really get to control the data when so many conflict of interest exist.

### You (2025-07-08T19:05:50.365Z)

control that. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:05:50.580Z)

To motor and financially induce them to control that. Right? Is is that realistic? Has that ever been done? Yes. It has. Let me explain what I'm talking about. And CBRE was the learning ground for me on this. Right? I went into this thinking when I joined CBRE coming out of Michelle Russo and and

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:05.725Z)

So thinking with with each other morning. They had both built these very closed systems for asset management.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:10.290Z)

Chad Chad's at CHM Warnick. They had both built these very closed systems for asset management. Right? And that's what I had in my mind.

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:14.895Z)

My mind. But I would secure

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:18.850Z)

But as I worked at CBRE and I spent time

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:20.095Z)

with the software engineer for

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:23.040Z)

with the global software lead software

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:24.325Z)

that evaluation team. And I spent time

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:26.060Z)

VAS, the valuation team. And I spent time with the global

infrastructure. Right? And so

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:38.150Z)

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:41.680Z)

we will work with Calibri. Like, I want

API.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:45.450Z)

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:49.245Z)

It in. Inside.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:06:50.360Z)

hummingbird right, and pulls it in and says, Nir, if you wanna use Hummingbird, that's totally an option for you. Right? You're probably gonna have to pay for Hummingbird. Does that make sense? Like, what Cindy would charge for hummingbird.

### You (2025-07-08T19:06:52.345Z)

That's option for you. Right? To pay for hummingbird. Further. That make sense? Like, what? Charge probably? Think that's about, like, tool for you,

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:03.030Z)

If you think that's a valuable tool for you to use in underwriting, we have an API

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:03.345Z)

we have an Yeah. I agree. For it. For

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:07.760Z)

integration for it, and we'll pull it in.

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:09.365Z)

I was talking to

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:10.350Z)

For, let me just use, I was talking to Thayer Ventures, and Barry Bloom introduced me to a young woman that works

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:13.825Z)

very that works there.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:19.870Z)

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:21.745Z)

She said, you know, if I were still at Citizen I would wanna put all

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:26.250Z)

if I were still at citizen m, I would wanna put all citizen m's data

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:26.485Z)

the citizen data in. Showing us. Hi. Because of how complicated

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:31.190Z)

into InvestAI because of how complicated

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:32.015Z)

for me to get the data. Out. Of

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:34.870Z)

it is for me to get the data out of

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:37.325Z)

ERP.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:38.140Z)

CitizenM's

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:38.775Z)

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:39.950Z)

ERP.

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:40.425Z)

want it in the. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:41.670Z)

This make sense? And so I would just want it in InnVestAI so I can pull the

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:42.895Z)

comp. And

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:46.130Z)

comps up really, really fast. And that's something that

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:46.675Z)

something try to work with on the management companies. Right? So that

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:51.070Z)

gonna try to work with on the management companies. Right? So that

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:52.815Z)

starts to see how data grows. Grows. Grows.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:55.230Z)

and and then you can start to see how the data grows and grows and grows.

### You (2025-07-08T19:07:56.875Z)

Let me think of another example. I

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:07:59.030Z)

Let me think of another example. I am a huge believer in

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:00.315Z)

I could think that. I don't it enough to put on your mind and Right? So our goal is to have an API

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:03.530Z)

travel click data. I don't think we use it enough in underwriting.

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:06.225Z)

integration

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:06.670Z)

Right? So our goal is to have an API integration

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:07.055Z)

It might be a trouble put might be a White House. Right? You know, I'd be with

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:10.470Z)

It might be with TravelClick, but it might be with Lighthouse. Right? It might be with the duettos and the lighthouses of the world already collect all that data. It might be a faster route for us

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:18.605Z)

And we start to you know, you know, no

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:22.090Z)

And then you start to pull if you want it. If you don't want it, no, you know, no You don't have that. You know, that's not part of your, workplace.

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:27.925Z)

workplace. You want it, you gotta pay for it. Right? But if it's valuable enough to you.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:32.320Z)

If you want it, you'll have to pay for it.

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:33.865Z)

Wanna be able to create the API integration with it.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:34.880Z)

Right? But if if it's valuable enough to you, we wanna be able to create the API and agree with it. Got it. And you think you can get to an API integration on those vendors as well as some of these management companies that

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:45.735Z)

Yes. I do. Collaborate with the CoStar, though.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:49.790Z)

Yes. I do. I don't think I don't know if we'll ever get it to with CoStar, though.

### You (2025-07-08T19:08:50.345Z)

I mean, right? CoStar CoStar CoStar is going here. Play ball with him on.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:08:54.290Z)

I mean, right? CoStar CoStar and Guardi are the two that don't play ball with anyone. Got it. Very cool. So do you do you guys think could we leave it and then you guys talk about it in maybe in, like, two weeks, circle back, and you could

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:09.545Z)

Talk we can clean up for more questions or and your follow ups, get your advice,

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:13.550Z)

can answer more questions or get your thoughts

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:14.645Z)

should do.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:16.600Z)

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:16.995Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:20.140Z)

Yeah. Jake, what do you think? Yeah. Let me go ahead. I was just thinking Nir, maybe it's efficient. You know, you and I give this some thought, chew on it. And we can trade a couple emails about some questions.

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:30.505Z)

That we can. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:33.000Z)

You know, and feedback that we could, you know, feed to you guys a little more. You know, maybe we'll have a list of, you know, things that would would be like, oh, what did you think about this, or we didn't ask about that. That maybe

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:45.865Z)

Maybe we can

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:46.960Z)

you have answers to some of it, not to others.

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:47.095Z)

discuss. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:50.040Z)

Some we could discuss in a couple of weeks kinda thing.

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:52.245Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:52.980Z)

That would be great because we're looking for that kind of feedback. Right? We're just worried that

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:57.565Z)

Friendly.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:57.790Z)

we put it in the hand

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:58.295Z)

To opt to us.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:09:58.960Z)

of an analyst that's not friendly,

### You (2025-07-08T19:09:59.595Z)

That if we're ourselves. Ourselves. And this point. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:10:02.250Z)

to, just to us that we could hurt ourselves more than help ourselves at this point. Yeah. So,

### You (2025-07-08T19:10:06.955Z)

For that.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:10:07.630Z)

Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you. As friends, thank you very much for that.

### You (2025-07-08T19:10:11.095Z)

One one thing I'm working on right now is more of a visual road map.

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:10:11.420Z)

No. Thank you for this and taking the time. Interesting to think about.

### You (2025-07-08T19:10:15.225Z)

Of of what we've got you know, for the proof of concept. What we plan for the MVP, and just to clarify, proof of concept is what the five of us within InnVest are working on, which I showed you today. MVP is what we can then open up to you And you can log in, create it, and you can test it. So we hope to get that MVP here probably within the, you know, maybe four or six weeks Need to figure out bandwidth from the developers. But then after that, it's it's wide open. Right? So this is where we say, Okay, now what do you think would be the best thing to add on to this and, you know, help us to prioritize I I've got a list right now of, you know, a handful of AI ideas, and I've got about 20 other feature ideas, you know, like mobile. Does anybody want to underwrite a hotel on their iPhone? You know? International. Do you know? Do you do you have any any assets in Europe? Or or in Mexico? Do you wanna have a conversion feature? Know?

### Guest (2025-07-08T19:11:23.930Z)
