# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:31:03.428Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-08-28T21:31:05.112Z)

Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:31:07.028Z)

Good afternoon.

### You (2025-08-28T21:31:09.912Z)

How's everything going?

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:31:11.828Z)

It's good. It's good. Today was a good day. Earlier, the week was just harder to push through. But today I had some really great conversations and excited to share them with you guys.

### You (2025-08-28T21:31:22.392Z)

Very good.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:31:29.188Z)

Hello. Hey, drew.

### You (2025-08-28T21:31:31.912Z)

Hey there. How's everything in sunny California today?

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:31:39.188Z)

Good. I just might have to drop off suddenly. My brother in law and his family just landed, so they're driving over. Oh, good. For the weekend. Like for the long weekend? Yeah, for the long weekend. Yeah. Is that fun? Is that like thumbs up fun or is that. No, they're great. They're very chill. And between the two families, there's five daughters. 13, 10, 7, 4. And our littlest one is almost three, so it's going to be wild.

### You (2025-08-28T21:32:16.552Z)

Good luck.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:32:17.268Z)

Going to be wild. I get there's a lot of shows, right? And dancing and singing and digging up the little ones. Nonstop. Nonstop. Yeah. How about you? Guys.

### You (2025-08-28T21:32:29.832Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:32:31.748Z)

Good.

### You (2025-08-28T21:32:33.672Z)

How was your presentation on Tuesday?

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:32:36.788Z)

It went well.

### You (2025-08-28T21:32:37.512Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:32:41.748Z)

Hard to know what they're going to do. Because it's a lot of money. But I think. What they saw, and they're really interested in one feature that we don't actually have yet. So we were trying to sort of walk the line between saying that we can do this. And just sign up with us and we can do it.

### You (2025-08-28T21:33:05.192Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:33:05.668Z)

And we don't have anything to show you right now because we don't actually have it yet. But, yeah, we'll see. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-28T21:33:17.832Z)

What's that adage? Never say no. Always say yes and scramble like hell to do it.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:33:25.268Z)

Yeah, that's what my business partners were very adamant. Brandon. Everything is a positive. Everything is a yes. And otherwise you're just shooting yourself in the foot. But I dislike doing that because there have been instances where we didn't develop the thing that they wanted for, like, a year, and then I just have to deal with them being really frustrated for a year.

### You (2025-08-28T21:33:39.432Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:33:55.348Z)

Hey, Benode. Hey, how are you?

### You (2025-08-28T21:33:58.712Z)

When I was at real page. Many, many years ago. And we were building central reporting. And they asked me to mock up a sample financial report. And how it would look. And I found out later they took that report to a client and said, this is live. This is what we're doing. I'm like, this is nothing but an Excel mockup, and we didn't even have financial data in the product. It was like, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:34:33.828Z)

A real page did that. They took it to a client and said that, oh, my goodness.

### You (2025-08-28T21:34:40.152Z)

They were known for doing that. They would promise something that didn't exist. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:34:43.668Z)

Over. Promise.

### You (2025-08-28T21:34:46.152Z)

And I almost quit because of that. I mean, I just like. Wait a minute. It's like you guys are presenting this as an existing tool. Existing report. And we don't even have any financial data in the tool at that time. It was just operating data because they didn't even have accounting. They were using a third party accounting. Tool and white labeling it. But all the data went to that third party and they wouldn't let us connect to their database to get it back out.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:35:20.388Z)

That's crazy. Gotta love sales. Okay, so why don't we start today? Mark is not joining. Sorry. He's missed two calls this week. But he had a concert or something that he's going through. And I know Drew may have to drop off because we're starting to get close to the holiday weekend. Where people may disappear for a bit. But, Drew, Mark and I talked about. We talked about it every time. But the need for capital versus how long it's going to take to develop the mvp. And the fact that Node, working the full time job, isn't able to spend his full energy on invest. We are really going to start after Labor Day going out and talking to potential investors. And we'll talk more about that in a minute. But we wanted to ask you guys if you could do something for us. And that is? Howard, you're already working full time on this. But the node. If both of you assume you were working full time on InnVestAI for six months, what could we realistically accomplish? Does that make sense? Because we're going to. Flip it around when we go start to talk to investors. And say when we go to the first to the friends and family. And Mark always talks about your homer. Say this over and over again because it is something that resonated with me, and he said it. But it's not where your hockey puck is today. It's where you're a hockey puck is going right? And so we're going to need to ask our friends and family to commit capital so that we can spend full time working on this. Right. So if you were just to imagine Vinod, you could quit your job. Tomorrow, and you and Howard could really focus full time for six months. We realistically create and accomplish in that time. Does that make sense? Because we'd like to kind of include that almost in our pitch deck when we're talking to people to say, this is what's actually going to be achieved. But we need X amount of funds to do that. And I'll just. And let me pause. Drew, did I miss anything? Well, just to backup, last time we spoke about express time that this has been a bottleneck for you. Howard, I know you're similarly all three of you versus Mark and I have alternate sources of income, so I know all three of you are extremely eager to get cash coming in to support you guys. Totally understand that in trying to figure out the best and fastest way to do that, Last week, I was sort of brainstorming, thinking that we'd go to Peachtree. We say we have this narrow, right, that the document processing piece, that really narrow feature. Hopefully that's interesting enough that they would start paying for it. So that was what we talked about, Mark Van and I, earlier. And Mark being the one. Well, Mark and Diane being the one that know these guys. A couple of narrow features on an incomplete product. Was going to be less appealing than selling Grand Vision in exchange for an investment. Sell a slim product in exchange for compensation. Like a vendor. Right. Which is what we're going to do longer or try to sell. So we talked about today, and it went back the other direction from what I had said two days ago, where I was like, I think we should try to focus on this product. This narrow piece, the document to customers. I mean, I think we can still focus on that. We will do that. Destroy his own experience. And knowing Brian and these guys at Peachtree and other groups. That it was probably going to be easier to sell to present to them the vision and the dream. And 50k check. Right. Versus them 200k in revenue for us on a product that we need to get to the finish line on the mvp. In order. The things that we wanted to have. We have the document processing capability. And the additional any additional components of the MVP that we've talked about. The market research the deal summary. So that, obviously, will be part of what we present. We have a pitch deck that really talks about the vision. Martha and I have been working on. And then the third part being. And this is where Diane's request comes from. A six month roadmap of here's what we've accomplished in the last month or two, here's what we're going to accomplish in the next six months. With your investment. And whatever in exchange for that's a safe note or whatever. So that's where the request. If you can get what could we get done in six months? Ideally, we get enough money that we could give you. The three of you can quit your job, right? That you even take that money. We'd get enough. Of these $50,000 checks from after say, like, okay, we have enough. Based on the budget for the next six months to commit for Vinod Howard, Diane, to get the compensation that they need for the next six months. While this gets developed. Without you guys having to moonlight or starve. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-08-28T21:41:32.872Z)

Very much appreciated. Yeah, no, it's definitely appreciated. So Vinod lets you and I go over this roadmap that I put together a while ago.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:41:44.228Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-08-28T21:41:45.512Z)

So, looking at the timeline, POC is done. We're working on the mvp now. Our target was early to mid September. Looks like it's going to be mid to end September. We can change that. But then version one should be out within 60 to 90 days after that. Which is what that would. Be probably January, right? So if we're looking six months out, then we probably want to go through March.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:42:10.548Z)

January. Yeah. I would just go through March. Yes.

### You (2025-08-28T21:42:18.472Z)

Yeah, I think we would actually be dipping into some of these features here, which is really almost all AI type of features. So the basics of the AVM plus some AI would be here in the MVP and version 1. So I think we can put together a timeline. I just want to go through with Vinod to find out. As long as he agrees with what we have on here.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:42:49.028Z)

Yeah. This looks good. And we can how definitely meet after this meeting or whenever you are available.

### You (2025-08-28T21:42:57.432Z)

Well, you've got access to that. It's in the confluence.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:42:58.148Z)

And discuss that.

### You (2025-08-28T21:43:03.352Z)

Investing icon from it.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:43:03.508Z)

And we'll continue with the. Given that six month thing, we'll continue with the Offshore as well, right? I'm in. True. And Dion. That's what I think. Yeah, continue with that. Continuing with that. I just caught what you said, Continue with the Offshore. Absolutely. And I think the other part of what we talked about last week, which. Which didn't really hit me until we talked about it again today. Was that Howard? You said you were going to get more involved. With the engineers, the offshore team. So that I guess because, Vinod, based on what you said the other day, it sounds like you're doing a lot of you're not just dealing with the major items, the big picture. You're dealing with a lot of the detail of the minutia. While these engineers get more familiar with what we're trying to accomplish and that perhaps could be as well supported or better supported by Howard from a product perspective with very clear PDRs and guidance. More involvement from Howard is much appreciated. Be that product or testing in communication. That'd be great. We'll appreciate a power like to involve more.

### You (2025-08-28T21:44:34.152Z)

Drew. What I was referring to is really kind of implementing more of a standard product management development relationship. If you're working for Google. The big companies I would put together prd, they'd have the document. They would go and do it because such a huge. But when you get down into smaller organizations, especially like ours, It's almost like the product and the engineering should actually be, like, one group. So when I get involved, what I want to do is before those engineers start writing code, Review the document with them. Make sure they have a clear understanding not only of what I want it to look like. And do. But why? So the more they understand the business point. Or the business purpose of what they're doing. The better they'll code right. Here. I'm done with this. Then I go and check it. Oh, no. Well, you miss this, this and this. Right. Then we have to go back and do it. If we can just avoid that, that really helps. And then also on the testing side. Right. So once they do get into it, I would go in there, and I'd probably, in many cases, ask you to go in there. And just make sure it's working right. Our formulas, calculating the way they should be. And just do basic QA testing to make sure it's done. And then we go out there. So that's really what involvement.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:46:17.028Z)

Okay, that makes sense. All right. Okay, so now, while Drew heard one of my updates, which is about. I had a great conversation with a woman named Glenn Appeal, which all saved to the end because Drew's already heard that in case he drops off. But on my end, I wanted to tell you guys about a conversation I had with a company called Pulse C R E this afternoon. And like on LinkedIn, I always follow anything that in the CRE space that's AVM or anything like that. I always like, like, like. Because then the content comes to me, right? More content comes to me. And apparently I had liked this company and forgot that I liked it. So they sent out an invite to me and they did a demo today. And it is really impressive. They have an interactive deck. That's beautiful. Like, it's actually like an interactive PDF and like our AVM where we have the metric cards. You know what I'm talking about? That change when you make changes in data. They actually have something like that, too. And I don't know what it's completely tied to yet, but what their goal is is their goal is to almost white label through groups like us, right? So their product, it would, I think in the future it could completely eliminate the need for a broker. Om so they charge $5,000 to their clients for this interactive deck. It's beautiful. It has high level detail. Granular detail. They did a DAC for a resort that's pitching four seasons, and it was incredibly well done. But their pricing strategy is designed so that we could mark up their product by, like, 50%. Right. And we could charge. A customer, say, 10k or 15k, which is the exact cost of what brokers got for creating an OM right now. And most OMs are just very static. Or in the case of CBRE, the hotel group, they were very proud of a. Well, it's probably more like AI drew like what you're doing now. But that they felt was interactive, but didn't even match what this product was from an interactive perspective. And what else did I want to say again? The ability to maybe link our live financials to their live PDF would be amazing. And I just think maybe we could create something like this ourselves. But this might be an area where the partner strategy is much better than the build strategy, because they're two years ahead of where we would even think to be on a product like this. And a cost of 5000k per om is a third of what the market pays right now. So we left it that again. I'm very impressed. And I asked them to send times over the next two weeks that we could do a demo for all five of us. So we could all see it. And maybe even want to consider. Fake hotel, like, almost like a mockup, if this makes sense, right? In our demo because the live PDF is that impressive. It looks really good. So I wanted to float that. No need to respond because you'll see the demo and then we can talk about it as a team after. But it was impressive. I thought they did a good job. Do they have any other real estate or hotel customers that they have one group that's pitching. I'm assuming they're a hotel developer pitching for season. Yes. In the broader CRE space. So across industrial, office, retail. Right. They're working with a lot of different owners and different. What's the word? Personas like Howard, that you call them. Right? Like different people in the CRE life cycle. They're new. They're very small. They've been around five years. But for us to create a product like theirs, I just think it might be better to just try to partner with them from the beginning. It would bring us something into our product that just looks incredibly amazing. And could help us move faster on replacing the OM concept of our strategy. So that was exciting. I was more surprised than I thought. I was pleasantly surprised, and I thought I was going to be with the product. And then the second thing I wanted to mention. Is, I had a super encouraging conversation with a woman this morning. She is a mentor to many of the women in the hotel industry. Her name is Glenn Appeal. She has her own investment platform, like a family office platform called Glencove Investment. She's probably in her mid-60s and mentors a lot of women in the industry. We went through InnVestAI. She really got it from the minute we talked about it. She understands the potential. She understands the potential scale that, yes, this could be 100 mil and ARR and a billion dollar business because of how deep the vertical is. She sits on the board of Avalon Bay. Plus a few other really significant company boards. And we left it. She was very encouraging to me. She was the accolades for how we built the team. Accolades for bringing Mark in to be the capital market space. And we left at that after Labor Day for me to send the investor pitch deck and the budget because she was talking about and she was very nice and clear. She's like, you need a six month Runway and that money's going to come from friends and family. And she said their friends and family. What I'M going to add to this is women. Women. Women who would support a female founded fintech startup like me being one of the co founders, right? And so she said, I can introduce you to xyz, and two of these people could be friends and family investors. Or the third or any three of them could introduce you to many women in the space that would be interested in partaking in your friends and family round. So in Glenn may be interested in doing it herself, like being an investor. So it was really great this morning for me to have such an encouraging conversation, someone who just got it so immediately and was so supportive of what we were doing. So I wanted to share because I feel like that's good news going into the holiday weekend. To hear someone just say yes. You guys are so on the right track. And I totally see what you're accomplishing and see the work you completed and understand what you need over the next six months. I rambled on both of those. But those were both good conversations today that really brought my spirits up. Like, okay. This is good.

### You (2025-08-28T21:54:09.032Z)

Yeah. Sounds very good.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:54:11.588Z)

Y.

### You (2025-08-28T21:54:12.872Z)

Thank you.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:54:15.268Z)

Eah, it was good. So I've dominated this half hour. Let's flip it around. Anything on your side, guys, that are updates or important that we chat about?

### You (2025-08-28T21:54:31.192Z)

Not a whole lot. I don't know if anybody's had a chance to watch the video or test out the CRM to see if that looks like it might be something that we can just pick up and run with. Pinch a few pennies, maybe just for a year or two if we need to. If we outgrow it and we want to go on with something more like HubSpot or Salesforce, at some point, maybe we need that.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:54:43.108Z)

I. Have, okay?

### You (2025-08-28T21:54:56.392Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:55:00.148Z)

I bookmarked the CRM that you sent out a couple weeks ago. Started to play around that I didn't put anything in it. CRM replit app.

### You (2025-08-28T21:55:10.952Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:55:12.068Z)

Bestai. Yeah. I started to put together. A list of these groups that we're talking. Peachtree being the one that comes up the most frequently. And I might start putting those in here.

### You (2025-08-28T21:55:30.392Z)

Not yet. Yeah, it's not really connected to a database, so whatever you input when you sign out, it basically refreshes. So, yeah, it's not really in the state that can be used yet.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:55:32.548Z)

No.

### You (2025-08-28T21:55:44.792Z)

And when I talk to the note about it right now we don't want to leave it on a no code platform. It's fairly secure, but we're actually install this in our environment. So it would be an InnVestAI CRM.com or something like that, right? So I just want to make sure before we do anything. And I don't want to distract his team yet. I don't think this is something we absolutely have to have right away. But it's something we can do. There's still some work that needs to be done on it.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:56:27.108Z)

And are you thinking this is a CRM for us to use internally, like to manage our own, not something that customers are using?

### You (2025-08-28T21:56:29.432Z)

Yes. No. This would be something where we would put the accounts and then clients in there. And this isn't the accountant user for the InnVestAI abm. This is really kind of our sales and account management tool.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:56:40.468Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-08-28T21:56:49.432Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:56:49.828Z)

That's what I thought.

### You (2025-08-28T21:56:50.712Z)

So I kind of consider yourself, Mark and Diane, our sales team right now.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:56:50.788Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-28T21:56:56.952Z)

You could just track activities in here, and we could just build on that.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:57:04.868Z)

Well, it's better than what Mark's using because he's using Excel and we can't pay for Salesforce yet. So how do you think that when we get to the point, if we need to transition to a Salesforce, will it be a hard transition to go from one CRM to another? Okay?

### You (2025-08-28T21:57:21.272Z)

No. The way that these tools are evolving, I think by the time we get to that point, it would be just as easy to replicate what we need in the system. I don't know. Maybe. We may never go.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:57:36.628Z)

I imagine that we'd have to go. Michelle's force is so expensive.

### You (2025-08-28T21:57:39.432Z)

Well, yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:57:39.988Z)

There are so many other.

### You (2025-08-28T21:57:42.072Z)

I think I sent the article that I read that was talking about all of the big SaaS companies that are in trouble. That in about two years that a lot of them could be out of business or totally change their business model because of tools like this, where you can get on. I mean, I had the 80% of this done in a day. And then doing bits and pieces of it. Over the next few days, if it's that easy, that somebody like me that doesn't code can put something together. I think Salesforce, Knobspot and all those people are kind of sweating. Profusely.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:58:22.308Z)

Interesting. Yeah. From my side. I think the extraction is doing good. The part that we are actually working on now is binding the data with the application. With the logic, with the formulas that you guys share. Drew and Howard, I think you guys worked on a new sheet, right, that you had shared. So kind of the formulas, PDR formulas.

### You (2025-08-28T21:58:55.752Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:59:01.348Z)

It should very clearly follow that use Valley guide. Although to our point, the other day. Right, like profit should just be a calculation from the revenue and expenses.

### You (2025-08-28T21:59:13.832Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T21:59:18.708Z)

Now, basically a team is more working on binding the data and applying those formulas on the application side. Vinod, when we went through the whole profit discussion the other night. We do on the investment side, we use expense. But I did think of something after that is sometimes when you're underwriting a deal and you get a P and L from an operator, half of the time they actually only show profit and not expenses. So that's a very frustrating thing when you're keying in numbers, because then you have to reverse it in your Excel model, and it's just like takes an extra couple steps. So I wanted to mention that because as you guys are reading PNLs, you may see a P and L that has no expenses and all profit from an operator. Right, Drew, am I right in this? Some of the operators only show profit. And so I wasn't quite correct when I told you that. Because if a PNL comes from an operator, there are times when they only show profit, and then you have to make the adjustment to expense. There are going to be examples of that. In the pnls that I provided.

### You (2025-08-28T22:00:29.912Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:00:30.228Z)

Okay, so right now.

### You (2025-08-28T22:00:31.752Z)

That's easy to overcome. If only nobody.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:00:36.308Z)

Right. So right now you're only mainly focus on USLI format and the embryo one, trying to read those correctly and then probably. Will also kind of tackle the other formats. Okay? Is it helpful? Just start with. Enbridge is a pretty good, clean, consistent PNL format. I would say another good like another one is Hei they're probably the next clean, consistent. And Davidson would be another pretty clean and consistent one. Davidson. Davidson, yeah. Agbridge, Hei and Davison would be three that are. I think they're all a little different, but you'll see that they're the most consistent between the three of them. And to the USALI document, That PDF document. If you've given Vinod's team those PNLs from each one of those operators. Okay, got it. And I can give more if you need more again. I have hundreds and hundreds. Yeah, I think we have enough for now. Always try new samples for sure. Accommodate new. What do you call no documents with a line. Okay, good. And then I guess maybe the last thing and then we can all draw off is Howard and I have a conversation tomorrow morning with our first investor, Mike Sherman. So I'm just starting with Howard, and then I'll introduce you all to Mike Sherburn within the next week or two. But just starting off with Howard. So Howard can kind of tell the red IQ story, but Mike is 100% committed. It's not contingent on an MPV or anything like. That. So we just need to talk about the specifics of getting the safe note. And how he'll fund and all of that. That's awesome. Yep.

### You (2025-08-28T22:02:49.832Z)

Yeah, I think.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:02:50.628Z)

Just in case this is crazy thing, but I'll just tell you guys this. His name is Mike Sherbin. But just so you guys know, he's my husband's best friend from growing up, and my husband's name is Mike. So my husband Mike has always called his best friend Sherbin. Because it's complicated for two mites. And therefore I call him Sherben. But Mike Fox and Diane Fox are the only two people that call Mike Sherburn. So I can't turn it off. It's been too long. It's been like 30 years. And so I can't turn that off in my head. But his name is Mike Sherbin, and if you hear me, call him Sherburn. I just wanted you to have that background on. Why? That's good to know. I'm not being rude, calling him by his last name. All right. Well, team, thank you. Just every day, I'm so thankful for you guys. And I saw how you showed that broader, bigger road map We will you guys work on putting kind of putting those things to or, yes, maybe, Diane, you said you were working on putting those things to expanding the budget. Okay. Putting things in So I'm gonna work with Howard and Vinod. Right? The they have to, you know, say what they can accomplish in six months, and then I need to make the three of us are in line and what compensation I'm putting in Right? Because we we talked about, like, a ramping owner draw. And and then I need to run the rest of my calculations by Howard and Vinod to just make sure we're all and and then we'll share with you and Mark. But just let the three of us handle that first, and then we'll share it with you guys. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-08-28T22:04:57.409Z)

Alright. I do have one question.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:04:57.559Z)

Sounds good.

### You (2025-08-28T22:05:00.889Z)

Diane, you had shared in our group LinkedIn about the unified what do they call it? Overture Maps Foundation announced a collaboration to tackle one of our industries, data interoperability for hotels and travel locations. So Drew, you have mentioned the census ID, which I also think you said was used as the star ID

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:05:32.699Z)

It is it is from STR.

### You (2025-08-28T22:05:34.039Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:05:36.679Z)

Like, it's their

### You (2025-08-28T22:05:37.649Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:05:38.019Z)

it's their

### You (2025-08-28T22:05:38.279Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:05:39.509Z)

ID number. And it is unlike other many other third party data providers, they don't change theirs. So, like, from operator to operator, for you rebrand, run it, whatever. Like, it stays consistent. So as Some of those census numbers have been the same for fifty plus years. However long STR has been around. And they also make it pretty publicly available

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:03.179Z)

Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:05.959Z)

So it's it's sort of a lot of people just use it as a industry standard number.

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:11.359Z)

So this LinkedIn post mentioned GERS, g e r s, IDs. That the same thing?

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:19.399Z)

Don't think so.

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:19.799Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:22.449Z)

Let me check with this. Is this the diagram where it showed Hilton Marriott and all the mess

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:25.579Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:26.969Z)

messy? And then yes. So the what this is

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:27.029Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:31.579Z)

well, the way I is that that is the problem when you saw that diagram. That the operating world is facing is that digital platforms, like, say, Expedia, Travelocity, you name it, like,

### You (2025-08-28T22:06:45.219Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:06:45.839Z)

any of them. Right? They don't have a universal code for a hotel, and therefore, there are often mistakes as to what hotel is actually linking to what platform, if this makes sense, because there are so many. And STAR is a standard coding system but it hasn't completely been translated over to all of these, like, many many entities that have a digital footprint. So the American Hospitality and Lodging Association has a working group right now established to create a digital ID for each hotel that's

### You (2025-08-28T22:07:27.689Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:07:29.049Z)

kind of like a star code, but that would stick with all of these entities They're only working on it though for the operations piece of it. Right? And then now you introduce AI and what I what what I thought that link was saying is pretty soon AI is going to force our hand in coming up with, like, one code. And then all of that messiness just kind of goes away.

### You (2025-08-28T22:07:55.829Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:07:57.119Z)

And my point is okay. So HLA is working on it. AI is gonna have an impact on it. But there's an it should link through to real estate. Right? Like, the code should be the same across

### You (2025-08-28T22:08:10.529Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:08:10.869Z)

and then into real estate, if this makes sense.

### You (2025-08-28T22:08:13.479Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:08:13.979Z)

So we can lead that. I'm I really feel confident that we're a group that could lead something like that in conjunction with the HLAA. And by understanding, like, how AI is gonna impact it. And that's what I meant when I said, you know,

### You (2025-08-28T22:08:28.539Z)

Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:08:30.109Z)

should be part of this. Yep.

### You (2025-08-28T22:08:30.779Z)

Yeah. I just I didn't know if the GERS or g e r s, whatever it is, was the same as the star ID. I agree. I think it's something that we should be involved in and the background on that is multifamily put together what they call the MITS, m I t s, multifamily IT standardization. They're still working on it. And it's probably been ten or fifteen years since they started that initiative because you you kinda gotta get everybody on board. Right? And a lot of people just aren't going to put any effort into it. But I do know that a lot of the vendors that took part in that, and they would put it on their website, MIPS compliance, and all these other things. It gave them a lift. So I think, yeah, even if we participate in something like that and

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:09:30.549Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-08-28T22:09:31.839Z)

just be a sponsor. It's It's definitely worth

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:09:35.009Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-28T22:09:36.329Z)

looking into.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:09:39.169Z)

Yes. I I agree. Because, I mean, I can see applications where if you have a code, then even things like major PCA projects right, could get attached, you know, like, if if this is making sense, like,

### You (2025-08-28T22:09:48.299Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:09:52.369Z)

from the vendors. So you would know when a roof or warranty, like, all these things that are very, very hard to keep keep track of right now could be digitized in the future across the the real estate side of of the of the property. And

### You (2025-08-28T22:10:06.089Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:10:08.539Z)

it it could be a source of

### You (2025-08-28T22:10:08.949Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:10:10.739Z)

profit for us. Looks like staying in cars check the smart car car car fax. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So you know what accident it was in, accident. Yes. Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-28T22:10:22.889Z)

Yeah. Hi. Very good.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:10:27.279Z)

Alright, guys. Uses VIN number. Right? Okay. Yeah. You put like a VIN number. Yeah. It's like a VIN number. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-28T22:10:33.899Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:10:34.879Z)

Yeah. Alright. Cool. Well, thank you, guys.

### You (2025-08-28T22:10:36.979Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-08-28T22:10:39.229Z)
