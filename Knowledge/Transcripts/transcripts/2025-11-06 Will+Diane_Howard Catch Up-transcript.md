# Transcript for: Will+Diane/Howard Catch Up

### You (2025-11-06T21:01:30.950Z)

Good afternoon. How are you?

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:01:33.107Z)

I am good. So, your daughter's office, does it still stay in her bedroom, or is it, like, truly your office, where you can start to move a desk in and hang things and.

### You (2025-11-06T21:01:47.350Z)

It's pretty empty.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:01:48.867Z)

It's pretty empty. Okay, that's good.

### You (2025-11-06T21:01:52.870Z)

This is. It.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:01:54.867Z)

But empty means it can become Howards, right?

### You (2025-11-06T21:01:59.270Z)

In his mind.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:02:00.387Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:02:02.310Z)

Yeah. Almost totally gone. There's a few things flying around yet, but all the furniture is out.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:02:11.187Z)

Got it. Not that we love it when our children's things are gone, right? Because we love our children, and that's sad. But at the same time, working at your office, being in your daughter's bedroom, right? There's a stressfulness to that, so it's nice when you can have your own. Space and feel like it becomes. And you're no longer a vampire living in the base, working out of the basement. Wait a minute. Hi, my name is Jason. Is this? Yes, it is. So it's jason. Jason. William webster, but I go by will. No idea. I've known you all these years and I didn't know that? Yeah. Yeah. It's really. I only use it in very few, and it's just for government work and paperwork and stuff like that, but I always usually go by Will. That's good. Well, it's so nice to see you. It's been. I know it's been a long time, but you. Were always, like, one of my fan favorites at cbre, and so it's nice to reconnect. Yeah, yeah. We worked really well together, I thought. And, you know, especially with all the cool tools that we were looking at at the time, you know, I think there's a lot of interesting stuff. It's a blast from the past. Definitely. Are you. Are you still in Atlanta? Yep. I'm still in Atlanta and I. Before we go too far, I want to make sure I introduce you to my co founder of InnVestAI, Howard Berends. Howard. You guys can chat and introduce yourselves. Howard. This is Will Webster. Will and I work together at C. Beren. Although C. Beren is such a. Well, you were Will Ziprcadia. So there is just this common sense of what being in an environment like that is like. And we were. We both worked in hotels, but we worked in different verticals, so I was. Technically in the valuation vertical, and Will was technically in the research vertical. But I should just. Before we jump in and catch up, I'd love for you guys to just introduce yourselves. So. I mean, Howard, want to go first?

### You (2025-11-06T21:04:39.270Z)

It's good to jump on the call. Just a quick background. I've done information in the state for. 30 years. Last 15 have been on the technical side. Product management. So primarily analytics. Business intelligence at the very beginning. And worked for real page twice. When. We created the central reporting product. And then later I had moved into utility management. Utility billing in esg. But. Back in 2021. I started working at rediq, which is on Librcadia and cbi. Multifamily is a red. Iq user. Which is basically evaluation model for. A multifamily. Before I got into tech side. I was a bulk, infinitely asset manager. So I had been on the acquisitions, asset management side of the business for quite some time. So. While I was at rediq dian. E. Approached. The video.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:05:57.827Z)

Over again and over again.

### You (2025-11-06T21:06:04.470Z)

Open up the first hotel hospitality. Brokerage team. And so. Diane was familiar with Rediq. And we coming up together with the Berkadia team and talked about the possibility of. Creating. A valuation tool. Like rediq. For. The hospitality. Space. But before we invest through that sold RedIQs, Radix had some operation issues. They were kind of caught in that. Class action suit with RealPage. And pretty much the entire rediq team. Was downsized in January. And. So diane and. I reconnected, started talking about. Her passion. Wanting to put together a saving for the hospitality space, and here we are.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:07:05.027Z)

And I'm very, very lucky. I mean, like Howard and Howard knowledge and Howard brings to the table. Well, when you learn what we're doing would not have been we would we in the hotel space would not have accomplished what we've accomplished without Howard and the expertise he brought and the technology know. How he brought Oprah from multi. That's really interesting. Do you currently have a working ABM for multifamily and you're just looking to adapt it to a hotels.

### You (2025-11-06T21:07:38.310Z)

Yeah. Actually, there are quite a few ADMs in multifamily, so Rediq was one of the originals back around 2,015. 2,016. But it was more focused on. Excel. But did basically have the ability to ingest a red roll of financial statement, extract the data. And then. Populate it into an Excel. They had two different products. One was their own Excel model, and then they also had an Excel add in. But they did have a product also called. First pass. Which. Is a fully automated back of the envelop. E type of ABM model which is fully online. The problem is when it was built. It was built using. Old. Database. Technology. The founders were Excel experts, they didn't really know much about it, so long story short is they did have an automated avm. Still do. That is very. Unstable. And. Other companies like Archer and Bath, and there's a few other companies in the meantime have come into that space. And quite honestly, leapfrog. Ged that iq. Now when they're now using more a. I. Type of. Data. And they are fully. Automated. And. You can always. Export your data to Excel. But they are really more than online platform. And that was kind of. The interesting thing is Diane, when I first started talking to her, she's like this. In the hotel industry, nothing at all. I'm thinking that besides us, there's at least three or four others in multifamily. Type of. Ass. Et class have some type of an adm. And so I was.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:09:44.227Z)

Right. And so that's what we did. Like, right. Like, our platform is Howard crossed over the dark side of hospitality. Right. And I'm sure at one point we maybe learned back in the multifamily in some way. But our product is for hotels. It's hospitality avm. We're starting to change the terminology around it a bit, and Howard is fantastic at helping us navigate AI in the future of AI, because we're now starting to really call it more AI augmented valuation and do away with the term AVM. Like it's been used over the past five to 10 years, but we have built we have all worked tirelessly for a year. We probably have over a million dollars in payroll sunk that we've just worked all worked for free. To build it. And so it is a combination deal path that is purpose built for hospitality roles. Up all your deals if it's, you know, broker deals where you're doing AVMs, or if it's appraisals, or if it's, you know, debt unstructured finance or whatever. So we have a pipeline management component of it. Then we have an avian, an actual underwriting model that's Software based, it's SaaS and it's sitting right now on devet on a dev site. We are. The third part that we're doing is we're using AI for data extraction out of P and Ls and we're doing well. We're probably getting close to 90% success rate on our testing of and we're doing annual data first, but extracting annual data out of P and Ls and automatically populating it into the underwriting model so the user does not have to do that anymore. That's amazing. Yeah, that's amazing. And that's the thing. We want to solve the data problem. Whoever wins data wins AI. And it's built. What we need probably a little bit more time, a few more months to perfect the data extraction piece, because we're our chief technology officer, who Howard brought. Over with him from rediq. And then we have a small team of offshore software engineers in India that are working on this as well. But we feel good about where we are. The one thing is, it's structured data. And so we could be working if we had the right leadership influence behind us. Right. We could actually be getting the structured data sent to us in a structured format. But being able to do what we're doing right now is game. Changing for us and we're starting to demo with lenders. Probably the first week in December might slip to the first week in January, with some of the largest hotel lenders in the United States very interested in the product. And we can give you a quick little. I mean, not a whole demo, but we can give you a sneak peek of some of what's under the hood. The one thing I want to add before then we start to talk about what you're doing and how things are at C. Beren in your life. Is. This is something that you know, this came to me. In large part from the work I did at C. Beren and where I was researching other property types solutions in technology. I call it the follow the yellow brick road. Like, I mean, Howard and I, despite having great success here and having this progress, we're really not creating something that hasn't already been created in the broader CRE space. It's just no one's done it for hotels, right? And so the next couple of workflows that we're going to start to embark on, I'll call it, you know, starting in, you know, we're rounding a year, so starting at the 18 month, you know, 24 month, but we're going to start to tackle capex workflows. So Pips. Right. And all of that, trying to digitize and bring all of that up and find the right partners that can help us do what we did with the abm. Only with renovations and pips, we're going to definitely be tackling closing workflows and legal workflows, but we will not be doing that. I mean, we're not. We're not coming up with the legal software ourselves, right? This is like what you did at C. Beren. We have all eyes on Harvey right now, who seems to be winning massively in the. In the big law firm space and so many of the hotel attorneys. That we work within our industry are using Harvey right now. So Harvey is on our radar screen as a potential partner. And then when I say, like, closing processes, you know, I'm thinking about how you actually close a transaction and getting all the way through the title and survey and operating prorations. And so we really want to create an end to end solution for the hotel investment space. That's our goal right at the end of the day. And it's, it's a 10 year vision when it's all said and done. Maybe it's eight years, maybe it's 15 years, just depending on how it rolls out. But that's, that's what we're doing. So, yeah, I mean, that's all really exciting and I. Guess, you know, kind of my frustration with C. Beren because, you know, we had laid the groundwork to launch our own avm. I mean, I worked on it for roughly three to four years. And we created it from the ground up, you know, activated the models, you know, it was fully automated. We had a dev team completely build it, and then, you know, it just got nixed, like, right at the last minute due to complications with the broader corporate culture. So I definitely have a lot of experience in hotel valuation, modeling and testing and experience with power, BI and business intelligence tools. So, I mean, but it's, you know, it's exciting because you all can, you all CBRE was just a large corporate machine. And to get anything done took months, if not years to get approval on expenses and to get buy in from senior leadership. So, you know, in a lot of ways, I think being swift and nimble is definitely the way to go in terms of getting these things off the ground. So, of course, you know, we met when you were in the research group. And I don't know if I've ever told you the story, but the first one of our first conversations when we were talking, you were very, very since was back in 2020, 2021 rise. Almost five years ago. You were really excited about all the work you were doing with API integrations for the research group and how you were staying up very late trying to figure out the API integrations. And your whole face lit up when you talked about, like, technology solutions. And I'll just always remember, like you in that moment, it seemed to be something that really, I don't know, just kind of, you know, lit you up inside, like the idea of it. And you did the extra work. No one asked you to do these things. You just did them on your own because you wanted to make progress and figure them out on your own. And I've always been very impressed by your dedication and just like your self motivation, you know, when it came to that. 2020, 2021. Now those are some fun times because there was a point where I was just kind of running research. Essentially it was Robert Bram and myself. So, you know, we got to play around and invent new tools. You know, until kind of Rachel came in. So, yeah, that was. Funny that you bring that up, because I really do miss, you know, just having freedom to build and invent and create like I did back in those. Those days. So, again, this is the catch up conversation, right? It's just I want to make sure that you and Howard have met. We stay on each other's radar screen. You know, Howard and I networked for years before we end up actually working together, but I wanted to see what's going on at C. Beren, are you gonna stay? What? I mean, goodness. Announcements and all of that. So I guess I'm assuming you've seen some of the social media posts. That have come through that was interesting. So it's been a bit of. So essentially, C. Beren long story short, CBRE hired some consulting firm to do a massive top down analysis of research. And I think it's, it's on a global scale. And so that firm came in and decided that hotels research was redundant with ea, and so they slashed most of our staff. Essentially, they're wanting to move me over to kind of a thought leadership role, but, like, it's. It's just not the same. And it's. It's a lot of. It's kind of up and up in the air, right? Now, you know, Robert is only here until. I mean, I don't want to speak for Robert, but confidentially, he's only here until December. You know, most of the group is gone. Rachel's gone. You know, a lot of people are gone. So we're kind of continuing operations, but it's. It's. It's not looking too good. So. Because I think they're just gonna absorb the research platform in the EA and then just call it a day. Is. And so I've been helping kind of guide them through that process. You know, I'm. I'm still here, but just barely know, I think. So it's. It's unfortunate. Because, you know, I think we were, you know, we were definitely seen as a large presence in the hotel space, especially with the Hotel Horizons brand and the which goes away benchmark, you know, and essentially all that. Yeah, it's a lot of it is going away because we can no longer. Operate. So, yeah, it was a bit of a. It's. Was it a shock when they made the announcement? It wasn't a shock because I. We could. You know, we were constantly under the gun. And, you know, you could kind of feel it. And this is happening in brokerage. It's, you know, VAZ is getting hit in certain ways. Yeah, I smell that. It's a pretty, it's a pretty big, large change that CBRE has implementing, and I think it's impacting other groups as well, so when you say ea, does that mean. And I might not even have some of these names, right. But Matt Curry is a name I remember on the multifamily side. And Julie. Julie had a role similar to what, Rachel? Yeah. Waylon? Yes. Is that what you're talking about or you're talking. About. They're the econometric advisors. So essentially they handle forecasting for all the other asset groups. Just hotels kind of existed in its own island because we had kind of separate products they never knew what to do with. And we had custom research, we had State of the Union. We had all sorts of stuff that EA didn't produce. So, you know, for a while, they kind of didn't know what to do with us. And there was a time where we were all going to. Jamie Lane was at the firm, you know, he was going to bring us to in the ea, but he was going to run the ea, so we. Would still have, like, a hotel's person kind of running the entire platform, but once Jamie left, it got very chaotic. So. Yeah. I mean, long story short. Yeah. So what do you want to do? So you're. Well, you'll probably feel grateful that you at least have a job. I mean. I mean, anyone feels grateful at a moment in time when they have a job, Right. Time to think about what they want to do, and so. Forth, but you could roll into this EA position and do. You could do some good thought leadership work potentially in an EA role, right? I mean, yeah, potentially. It's just, it's hard, you know, I've kind of lost that, you know, that fire that you talk about clearly over years, over the years, because you. Know, I constantly was building exciting tools and exciting programs and then just to get it, you know, shut down time after time. So I. It's. It's. It's kind of hard, you know, I'm definitely not as gung ho with the company as I was, you know, four or five years ago, and. So there are a lot of, a lot of investment companies out there that are investing heavily internally in their own data, their own infrastructure. Right. Like Host continues to aggressively invest. Noble, you know, Peach Tree. I mean, you name them, you know, like all of the larger hotel investment platforms are, but it's a little bit of like, what Drew Wallace is doing. And Drew is a partner of ours as well. I should mention that. And Drew. Drew is a partner of ours because he knows, like Robert, right? He knows the hotel data. And you sally down to at a granular level that the rest of us don't. So that fills in like, you know. We're trying to create a team where we need to bring something very unique and special to the table. So Drew kind of like. Like Robert really knows that you Sally part, But why I was going with the companies. It's like, are you thinking about moving over into the investment side and helping a company build out? Their internal tech infrastructure or like or go to Smooth Travel or Calibri? Probably not. Okay, I've heard some terrible things about not Smith Travel, but co star. Working for a large company is probably not not my my next step. I would think just because you know it just working at CBRE was was such it was such a difficult time, you know, like, how hard it was to I literally cried tears. Like, I mean, like, you know, like, like. You're not gonna do this. Are you serious? You know how much money we could make off of this? Yes, but would, like, Cindy's doing some really exciting things with what she's doing now with her profit data as well. And I think she's been. And she's been doing some hiring. I'm trying to think who else. That's the screen. Yeah. Have you talked? I've already. I have a lot of experience with calibre. You know, I like their data. Like their. How they. Well, I mean, sometimes. I mean. It's been tough. You know, I would go line by line and audit their data a lot of the times. But, you know, I still think it's important to have, you know, if we're just listening to SGR to get a different look on hotel performances all and I thought some of the booking channel demand information was pretty interesting. And I thought. I always thought it was something we kind of underutilized. But, I mean, I love data and I love being in the hotel space. So I haven't really given too much thought to next steps. I'm kind of. Kind of seeing how the chips fall. But the way that you're describing the AVM tool that you're developing is really interesting because, you know, it's something that I had a lot of experience in, you know, just building out, testing that model. And the fact that. Keep going. Well, keep going. The fact that. So you were able to. Some 90% of your tests, you were able to get a reasonable value output. Is that, Is that what I mean? We're working right now? Well, one, we have AI tools that exist today that did not exist even six months ago. Right to our test. We're testing at a pretty high level when it comes to the P and L. And first only annually. But really, once we get that down, then we can start to apply some rules based. And this is really. I'm going to talk about this and then I should just shut up and let Howard talk about this, because this is really where Howard excels and shines. But like, once we start to be able to apply some rules based logic that the AI can use, then we'll be able to go deeper and do like monthly and even more granular. And then third, I retain and I may be the only person in the hotel industry in the United States of America that retains this optimism. But between profit sword and atelier and what I saw at Benchmarker, I believe the managers with the right inducement would send their data digitally to a service provider if the owners required it or if the lenders required it. Right? Like, it's just going to take. Just like when Dealpath launched, it took Blackstone standing beside them saying, oh, no. Hey, jll. Oh, no. Hey, C. Beren. You guys are going to do this because we can no longer operate the way we're operating manually. So that's the success. That and then. Now the next thing we're starting to work on is, ok, like a cherry. Then how do we start bringing in ancillary data? Right. Like, Drew's already got a good start with the STR data, but how do we then start to think about bringing in the hummingbird data, and how do we start? To think about bringing in the Medallia data and all the things that owners appraisers need to speed up their process. We want to be the ones and we want to have a gentrific AI relationships with these groups too. Like for example, Procore is very much on our mind because procore is the leading construction management software company. Right. So a lot of hotel renovations, the GCs are using Propor. It's just not. No one's connecting those dots. That exists in Procore. Or it exists perhaps in some other software that could be getting used. And then we just connect the dots correctly. How do we start? To be able to, you know, have, again, this agent relationship with companies like Procore and Harvey and bring all the workflows into what you could call like a command central for an investor and, you know, an appraiser company, a broker, an owner, you know, whatever it is. And if I could pause. Howard, I know. We're not really ready to do a demo, but could you just. Would you mind just giving a couple of glances to Will as to. Like. What the. Is that all right? How are you mind. Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:30:07.590Z)

That. 'd be fine.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:30:09.827Z)

And we're going to start the demo in December. I mean, it might actually, because of the holidays, push to the first week in January. But we have quite a few lenders that are interested in this and that have been wanting a product like this, but have not been able to figure out how to create it or find a company that is creating it. So. And again, this is where Howard. This is Howard. This is Howard domain here. Wow.

### You (2025-11-06T21:30:40.390Z)

So what I'm going to be showing you today. Is very early in the development stage. So consider this to be about one level above a sitcom. But there's a couple of them here. So this is actually what is in. Our production killing today. And then I also have our original proof of concept here that I can kind of listen.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:31:08.707Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:31:11.590Z)

But essentially the way that we've got it set up is. Either Incoming in. They want to create a deal. So you input the basic info here, some property details here. What type of. Hotel, is it? Managing company would be optional. Et want to upload my documents, which would be initially financial statements. What's going up in.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:31:41.907Z)

Oh, sorry. Does it. Can you do it in any format? So, if it were a Word document or Excel, are you able to upload it or is it only Excel? Okay, well.

### You (2025-11-06T21:31:53.350Z)

Excel and PDF are the ones that we're working with right now, but once we get those, text file or anything else would be fine.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:31:56.627Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-06T21:32:01.670Z)

It was down here. And I'm going to mention we are having some really good success with the Excel and the PDF files. Over 90% right now. We need to get it to the upper 90s before we really feel confident. And. We are. Looking. At before we go and release the MVP for testing with prospects. To be able to extract it on a monthly basis, not just a year.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:32:31.347Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-11-06T21:32:33.190Z)

Because. Not everybody dies in Hotel on January 1st.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:32:37.987Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-06T21:32:41.990Z)

Get the year to date the information, Seth, we will be able to extract that monthly. So I'm going to go ahead and just cancel out of here. I don't have some of this option.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:32:51.427Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:32:52.630Z)

Or mandatory refields filled out. So this will be what you would be looking at once you set up. Your. Property details up here. When I uploaded document, it'll be available here. Whether it be a financial statement, the own. Any document that's related to the deal can be uploaded here. And then down here, you can see what will be released in earnings. We will have the ability to generate an AI summary of the deal. So in addition to all the documents that we upload, it can go out and get some macro level market information for region types, et cetera. Just like if you were to use chat, GPT or cloud to go something like that, right? So again, you can kind of edit the daemons. You're back here. I can continuously upload documents as they come in. And so this is kind of the heart and soul of it here. So you go into. Once you have this information, you would go into the profila scene. Did have a section up here, the summary table, which will have key metrics for. Over here. The keys, et cetera. Occupancy revenue expenses. And this would be visible at all times. So it may not have which of these pages that I'm working on, whether it be updating the adr, the revenue. Or the extensions. I keep going down here. This information is always going to be visible. So every time you make a change, I can see how that affects all of these. Metric. S up above. Or I can hide it to get a little bit more real estate. But yeah, this is a point. Lemmings, switch over to the other. Because what we have this set up here for is on the left hand side. You're going to see the historical information. So whether you upload one year or four years, it doesn't matter. You'll have all your historical data here. And then on the right hand side over here, you'll have your annual projections. So whatever I input as my home period, and I'm setting up the deal. I'll have that number of columns over here. Let me jump over then to the profile so you can kind of see. So here, one that I've got set up with some test data. So you can see the key metrics here. You've got your gross operating profit. Your GP for available win, et cetera. Same thing as I go through my occupancy expenses, et cetera. And so you can see as I scroll down this page, Or move to a different page, like my expense analysis. That's always there for view. So once we have the historical information set up, and you can see that I've actually been testing some of that monthly uploads, this would actually be automatically populated. So if I upload an operating save it, that has year to date through April, you'll see the word April down here. I just had the Dropbox here Just for testing purposes. Right. So if I go back and I can get to April. See most time and change. So you can see right now for our occupied rules, we're at 10,122. If I go to July, we're at 17,082. So that's in math. It all works there. But from that point on, for my projections, if I start at the top of the day and I'm looking at occupancy, so one of the things I can just choose doing here is going in and import of different occupancy for each month. Or if I want to do a year over year growth, I can come down here and then I can import down here. Since I think my applicancies go down 3% or up 5%, I can put the information in here. And also everything doesn't have a Sue here. As well as my calculations on down, you can see I've got my 80. Flexibility here too, as well. So if I want to just choose one area growth rate like 3%, I can input it there. Jump. Back up. There we go. From my. Ad that'll change my area here. And you can see each one is increasing 3%. Or if I want to get more detailed, I can just put in a flag based. And I can come down here and then put it. So I think I'm going to get 2% year round, 4% in year two with a 3%, you can see how everything changes there. Scrolling down here. Obviously it kind of convinced the Revpar historical as well as my forecast based on whatever I didn't put above. Revenue right now. It was based on per occupied room. And as naol mentioned as well, for the lenders. They are good at. The top line. Right. So feeding that range, other operating miscellaneous. But what we do have and what we will have is we're going to go back here to this property details tab, because what we don't have on the. Other item that I was showing you at first is the ability to get down into the minutiae of some of these groups. So market will have to be able to give the ability for them to drill down. So you might have a food, beverage and just a restaurant. Or I might have a quick service. Whatever I choose down here for these subgroups, it'll automatically choose the above. And that in turn will automatically got to cancel out of here. When the time is right.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:39:11.107Z)

Both.

### You (2025-11-06T21:39:11.110Z)

Automatically expand these food and beverage groups so I can actually forecast by my item. Expense is similar, although you have more options here. So maybe I can forecast my expense even on a per occupied win based as a percentage of revenue. Or I can just go ahead just name the input numbers I want without any type of calculation. If I want to write it down there. What kind of sets this apart is as I scroll down here, you can see we get down to the addicta line, but we also have our input from save for replacement, and we get all the way down to the net operating income. Well. Which is a lot done lower or more detailed. Going to leave them live with tools out there. But on top of that, we also created capital expenditures. So if I need to add a new roof, I can import that. Select the category, which would be building exterior. And then I could just go input whatever year I think that's going to happen. Right. And I can just keep adding new items as I go. So there's really no limit to how many x.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:40:30.867Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:40:32.230Z)

All right, so again, jumping around here. Once we have any of this information in here. One thing I did see over 2 what we add and say, the ability to upload market comps. So one of the features that we have out of some of these partnerships that we're working on, one of them that we've got available commitment, that is somebody that Drew is very close to the lark invested information. So if a reasoner is also a client of Lark, we can automatically import this information here and you can see set up using the starcode as well. So if user has that information they can upload that. So we'll have market information. Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:41:23.347Z)

Sorry, sorry. Real quick. Are they getting performance data or is it just. Is it just property level information? Kind of.

### You (2025-11-06T21:41:34.710Z)

Pretty much copy that information.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:41:36.147Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:41:37.430Z)

Depending on what they have. However, we also have two other pages here, so if you want to get into a little bit higher levels, So one of the things it happens in multifamily as well. Operators speak to each other.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:41:53.747Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-06T21:41:55.670Z)

Will tell how you're doing it. How's your rate? You can learn about all this, right? So I can go ahead and say this thing I might have.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:42:01.267Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:42:05.510Z)

Sorry. Hyatt down. The street. And I can call that and I can see. Okay, what you mean is it once the date, how many available rooms, what's your occupancy percent. What your adr. I can jot down notes in that night going this might be 2,023. I can keep going with 2,024, and then I can add another property for. So this is another way of adding your own custom comps into the model. And then the third is keeping track of the old transaction summaries. So if you wanted to track your own sales. So basically, you can see what we're doing here is we are creating. A very inclusive. Model. For a particular asset, so it's at the asset level where you can have all this information. However, all of this information is also being included in our aggregate database. Right. So as part of. The agreement that we would have with our users. Then we have the option to opt in to data sharing. Which at some point then we will have. In addition to the SAO report and all these other markets out there, we will have our own database.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:43:25.187Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-06T21:43:33.750Z)

Some of it put in by the clients. So of course. Fine code at the bottom and studio how accurate the date is, but of course. We can add this information here. Then we'll get down to the investment summary. And this is your typical vessel summary. So, based on my acquisition assumptions here. My projected operating information and then my assumed exit and sales expense information. You'll be able to calculate your metric seal. The metrics cover up about, et cetera. And so one last thing real quick before I jump over to this. Also, as part of the initial setup, I'm at. Sorry, I seem to be sitting around here. I did forget about this page. But as I'm setting up the deal, I also put in my investment assumptions here. If I'm going to be using the cap rate method, if I'm going to use the DCF method, one of my acquisition costs. One of my financing assumptions. We have the option here. Considering the basic percentage of closing costs. If I want to put in the detail, then this information on the right becomes live and I can go line by line and input my closing cost assumptions here, something I'd probably do as I get closer to the closing. So you can toggle between the two. Same thing for the equity. So invest your equity. Partnership equity. Of course this is only adds up to 70%. So I probably want partner number two that can give me the remaining 30%. Again, you can keep on adding partners. And then the exit assumptions here. What was my assumed exit cap rate was my Excel expense. And then all of these items above will bring you down to the invested summary.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:45:35.907Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-06T21:45:36.470Z)

Yeah. So very high level. But you can see how we've got this set up to be, hopefully, in a very natural workflow. That the leaders have used right from the time that they get the information from the broker. Put it in the basic name and add us all the way down to what is your investment summary?

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:46:04.867Z)

Yeah. I mean, that's. That's really amazing. I love the. The detail that. That you were able to kind of incorporate with the debt analytics and, you know, being able to adjust the source of financing. I thought that was really interesting. Yeah. I mean, this is. This is great.

### You (2025-11-06T21:46:24.310Z)

Well. Thank you. Thank you. Our next step that we're actually working on. Now I'm trying to get the step ahead of the developers. And Diane mentioned earlier the AI augmented deal. Which essentially will require. The new. Fill out all of those inputs. At the beginning so you've got all of the proper information. And then we're Larcin Tan the valuation tabs where the input there acquisition assumptions. Push a button and you'll get more back in the napkin first run. We'll be using identity. I've already tested it on a couple of properties, and we'll go out and gather your tax information, prior sale history. Of course, a little. Bit more micro economic information. So a lot of this information can go out. Get that information, bring it back. Populate it, along with your assumptions for your work inventory, too. I think I'm going to get. How long am I going to hold this? There's a lot of stuff that AI cannot do. Inside your heaven. What are your partners?

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:47:45.587Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-06T21:47:47.030Z)

But once you fill that in it double check reverse engineering when it go about what the information and then tweak it in voice detect where you can get this information and then you can literally just ask. Recommend to me what are the best options that I can change into? Increase my ROI or my cash on cash return to X percent. Right. So instead of going and inputting values until you get it to where you need it, maybe I do that, right? We're actively working towards that already.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:48:31.827Z)

That. That's. I mean, that's amazing. It's definitely the future. And so the macroeconomic information that is powering the analysis, is that just pulled from kind of public sources that the AI Finds, or are you using any. Okay, that's great.

### You (2025-11-06T21:48:52.950Z)

It will just be the public sources that we can find. So counting tax. Prior history, coming from public records, things like that. As well as. The infection that has already been uploaded. As well.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:49:12.947Z)

And you can imagine how powerful this will be like if we are successful and in the next couple of years, Make a dent in capex and renovations and pips like all of that data. Right. Then if you, if you think about, you know, you. We could have really good intel on that. The more that used for underwriting and the more that we can pull it through and try to have it be used for loan monitoring as well. Right. And other. Other functions that require the data to be kept up on a monthly basis. Then you start to be able to have data like benchmark, essentially. Right. And we can do in APP expense benchmarking. That's part of the vision. And as Howard mentioned, this is like one step above a stick figure. Right? So when I was at Vaz and I was working with the technology team, they always were like, you just have to build the scooter, right? So this is the scoop. This is the scooter. But the scooter has a lot of promise, and we're at the point where, if we can get a couple lenders to say they really need a product like this and they like it, and then we can show traction that we have real customers willing to pay, then that helps us go back with the fundraising and find, you know, a handful of friends and family investors that. And we already have one. We have our first I can't disclose who it is, but we have our first, you know, and safe note investor that has invested in us and is a firm as an active firm in the hotel investment space. So we essentially coordinate a handful of these small and friends and family investments, spend the next year trying to get the scooter into a Chevy, right? Or whatever is our next. We work on the data integrations, we work on the CapEx, and then I think we're ready to just keep growing and growing and growing. Which brings me back to. This is like a long term. I mean, this, this could take us. I say 10 years. It could. Be eight years. It could be 15 years. Right? You look at Deal Path. Deal Path launched a decade ago. Right. A Lease AI launched a decade ago. Pro Core launched a little over a decade ago. So all of this exists in cre. It just none of it exists for hotels. And. And I believe that story will resonate. With investors because no one's going to come build this for us except us. Right? We have to do this ourselves. We can't expect. We can't expect jail. Spark and deal. Deal Path automatically come up with an awesome hotel module because they just, you know, it. You work at C Beren, right? They don't. Care about hospitality. And so it has to be built by people who care about and understand hospitality. And it's we ever we have the yellow brick road, we can see who's done it, who's done it effectively, who's monetized it effectively across the other asset classes. And now it's just a matter of getting out there and, you know, getting a couple first customers, getting the first few investors and spending the next 1224 months with our heads down. Really. Building this scooter into the next version. Yeah. I mean, you definitely have a really good start. You know, I think in a lot of ways, you were able to kind of take it further than. Than what we did. And a lot of it. I think, you know, the power behind a tool like this is essentially the data that's powering it. So the more comps that that feed into it, the more powerful it's going to become. You know, which is something that, you know, only time can tell, you know, after years of use, so. But I'm really impressed with the whole. Yeah, I think it. It's. It's really well done, and you're definitely in a. In a good starting place.

### You (2025-11-06T21:53:31.110Z)

Thank you.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:53:32.787Z)

Yeah. Thank you very much. And so, again, it's not like, you know, I. As. I'm learning or, I don't know, maybe it's. I have a very informal style, is that I just believe in networking, and I believe in networking with people that you believe can really bring something unique to the table. Right. And that's why I was not I knocked on Howard door for as long as I did. I knocked on Drew's door for as long as I did. Howard brought our chief technology officer in, which was a blessing, because there's no way I could have found a chief technology. No way. I could have done that, right? And so we'd like to keep you on our radar screen because you made one of your career to go a different direction. We don't actually have the money to bring anyone on board technically yet either. But you know, hotel data, you are passionate about integrations. You are a person who is a self starter, right? You know, a lot of people in the hotel industry, and there's certain things. I mean, Drew has his own company as well, so he can only work X amount of time on something like this, which leaves us with some holes that we're going to have to fill next year. But when we're. When we're. Doing this in a startup. I mean, I learned a lot. Like, you're no longer a W2 employee, right? You're like. You know what I mean? It's just, like, you learn to be very lean and. Howard, how I'm rambling here, but it's been. It's been. I've always been a W2 employees, so it's a level of risk that I'm still getting accustomed to. I just believe in it so much that I'm willing to take that risk. And I believe in 2026 we will have money to pay people. It just will still probably be sitting somewhere between what our true market rate is and what a startup with, you know, participation and shares and things like that could be. So I don't even have a job right to say, well, we'd love to bring you on board. I just know you're on my radar screen and I'm trying to make sure Howard knows who you are as well. And you could go a completely different direction with your career. And which case, I hope we always stay in touch and can be good colleagues and, you know, help each other in our careers. But I just wanted to let this idea sink in for you and let you turn it around. In your head a little bit and just digest. Well, I'll have to definitely dust off a couple my old models just to see. Just to see. Because a lot of what you all showed on the screen was, you know, I think, what we were envisioning in terms of an end product, I think, and some things. Were different than what we were trying to get. So I think you definitely have a lot of promise there. In any way that I can be helpful, you know, if you need help testing or debugging certain items, you know, I'm happy to help in any way going forward. We might really actually take you up on that, because right now, Drew is doing. I mean, I am. I am at max. I can't do it myself. Drew's doing it. Drew's starting to be at max. Right. And so we might take you, you know, take you up on that. And right now, the product's at a very thundering at. A very high level. But as Howard mentioned, our intention is it's the same model for everyone. Right. But it's just like an expanded collapse for people that are like Trinity, who will need an incredibly complicated underwriting model. Right. With roadmapping and DU asset management. That, that will come later for us, but that it should be in. It should be in the same model. Right now we're focusing on people who need to underwrite at a high level and at speed. Right. That they need to get through a hundred deals in a week at a high level. I think that's the best way to enter. To enter. And you know. Begin our go to market strategy. Yeah, so. And you're still in Atlanta, right? If I remember, I actually moved to West Palm beach, so I'm in Florida, but, yeah, it's nice. Well, that's nice. You're sitting in West Palm beach in a suit jacket that just connects there. I didn't know whether to dress up. Or not. I got it. To tell you the truth, I have shorts on right now. Is your wife. Did you guys move there for your wife's job or for her? Yeah, she's a professor at Palm Beach Atlanta universities, and our team is remote. We like it down here. It's great. Got it. Got it. Howard wife is an academics as well, right? Howard? Did you say your wife. Your wife has a PhD? Yep, mine does.

### You (2025-11-06T21:58:42.870Z)

Professor department chair. And a private school here in Gran Rapid position. The back of the head of the Kinesiology. Department.

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:58:56.707Z)

A lot. Yeah. Marketing.

### You (2025-11-06T21:59:01.510Z)

Ok?

### Guest (2025-11-06T21:59:02.547Z)

Yep. Sushi does a couple classes at the university. And, yeah, she loves it. It's been great. That's great. So we went over by a full half hour. It's impossible to really talk about this. I could talk about this for two hours. I do have a lot of ideas about feeding in forward looking projections and automating a lot of that. Now my brain is just turning, right? Yeah. Yes. So let's sink in, let it digest. Again, influence goes. I don't have a job right now because we're not even paying ourselves. But the way the process will work is hopefully in December and January, we get interest from two or three banks that say they would like to use this. We use that then to go very quickly find a handful of friends and family in the hotel industry, which shouldn't be that hard because there are people who I think, just like the first safe note that I found, right. That we could find some people that would be interested in investing. 75k to 100k. It gets us around 500, 600, 700k and working capital initially that then we can start to pay our team and then we put our heads down and just start iterating. Iterating. Iterating. Iterating. We will always be iterating. It's exciting. I wish you all the best of luck and any way I can help. I do have a lot of because there's definitely a market and if it's only 75k a lot of times that's what some of our Enterpriser clients would pay for a Horizon subscription. And Your tool is 10 times the value of that, in my opinion. But with the 75Ks for the safe notes, does that make sense? That's to kind of like, help us get off the ground. We have not figured out the pricing strategy. Howard has spent a lot of time on the pricing strategy, but the pricing strategy there will be like, I don't even know where to go with this. The core model itself will have a pricing strategy, but then each module we can develop that makes it even stickier, like the capex module than would have another pricing strategy. Right? And it becomes so much more useful to clients. So the 75 to 100k is if we can go find. Let me just try to think of capital, I guess. Yeah, yeah. It's target capital. It's like Mark Woodworth. It's like Greg Marcus. It's like I'm trying to think of the McKibbens, right, who already own M3. I. Could give you a list of 20 people that we would want to target. And if we could just get a handful of pre money safe. No. And so they're investors in the company, right? Just like until started. And then the banking clients, they would be charged much more. Right. Because they would be enterprise clients and we would be looking to bring an enterprise solution to them. So those would, I mean, those clients would have to be generating hundreds of thousands of dollars. But we think that if we can solve, if we can solve the workflow and the data integration piece for them, that they'll find it of value. And does that make sense? And feel. It definitely does. I mean, like CVRE valuation. I mean, Mike, Tommy could be clients of ours in the future, right? Wouldn't that be a funny thing? But, yeah. There are already clients of Rediq, so. Right, yeah. All right. Anyway, we're up with time, so it was so nice to catch up with you. Please let this all marinade and we'll catch up in maybe after the holidays or something like that and see where we stand. Okay? Okay, great. Fingers crossed. And. And I'll. I'll. If I have any ideas, you know, shoot them over. I'll shoot them over, definitely. Okay, thanks. It's nice to see. Have a good one. Okay? Bye. Thank you.
