# Transcript for: Howard | Vinod weekly call

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:25.180Z)

Hello. Hello.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:26.380Z)

Hey, how are you?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:28.300Z)

Graduate yourself.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:29.900Z)

Good. Happy Monday.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:31.980Z)

Happy Monday happy Monday.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:33.340Z)

Do you have a decent weekend?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:35.980Z)

Yep. Wyken was super duper productive.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:38.300Z)

Good.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:39.340Z)

I just didn't move.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:43.180Z)

I guess it depends on your perspective if that's a good weekend or not. It's good for productivity.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:47.420Z)

No.

### You (2025-09-08T21:44:48.220Z)

But I hope you had a chance to get a little bit of rest.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:44:53.660Z)

I mean, that was definitely there. But made some good progress. Did you go on Deb at all?

### You (2025-09-08T21:45:02.380Z)

No, I did not. Go on, dev.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:45:04.700Z)

Okay, then let me show you something. Probably it will. Help you get some. You'll get to see some good things here. So we have that AI summary here. As you said, we should have a button here and all this. So that is there. Let me refresh first. I hope my boys didn't break anything. Past concern. Always after I get back. So right now. So basically, this is how it looks. So you can have the data preparations like this.

### You (2025-09-08T21:45:46.380Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:45:47.340Z)

Whatever summaries you have generated will show here. And then I have also put, for whatever our development purpose right now, how much the report is costing and all that.

### You (2025-09-08T21:46:00.220Z)

All right. This is going to be within the deal, right?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:46:05.820Z)

Within the deal. Yeah. So I'm in this deal right now here.

### You (2025-09-08T21:46:06.540Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:46:09.660Z)

Davidson this. The document is already uploaded. Data extraction is very clunky. Because we are still. The accuracy is not there, right? I mean, we are able to extract the data, we are able to insert the database. It's not 100% accurate. So we are kind of putting a lot of effort in improving that. But I'll show you by generating one summary or whatever with whatever data we have right now. Is going to get better once we have better data available.

### You (2025-09-08T21:46:45.740Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:46:47.580Z)

But this functionality is there. This is kind of functional. So once data is better, We get better result. Right now. We don't get lot of good results, but let's see how the report looks. So your report is basically generated here. I'll put some notification there, like, you know, the report is ready and this is how much it costs us.

### You (2025-09-08T21:47:13.900Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:47:16.220Z)

Once I click on view, hopefully it will show me some data here. So executive summary of whatever. Deal we did. We have properties overview here.

### You (2025-09-08T21:47:32.540Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:47:33.580Z)

Again. How good this data is yet to be verified.

### You (2025-09-08T21:47:36.300Z)

Right? Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:47:40.460Z)

Okay, what's going on? Okay, so since we didn't have more data. So it didn't create these ones.

### You (2025-09-08T21:47:45.260Z)

Right. Cool. Cool.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:47:49.340Z)

And then you can also download it. In a PDF format. And then if I open it here. And I mean, I'll improve the design of the PDF this. This thing, but.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:03.740Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:48:04.780Z)

This is kind of functional. And then we can also see how much it cost us here. So this is what it cost. And this summary is always there. So even I reload, right? The summary will be there. And suppose you generate more than you'll see 1, 2 ohm whatever number you generate.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:22.220Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Nice. So which LLM is this connected to?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:48:32.940Z)

This is aws bedrock.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:36.940Z)

Bedrock. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:48:38.060Z)

Yeah. Is the bedrock. And then internally, it uses clot. 3.5 right now.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:42.380Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:48:42.860Z)

We can always upgrade, but that costs little more.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:45.820Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:48:46.300Z)

But I think 3.5 is. And this costs vary. Sometimes it is, sometimes it like 0.2 something. Sometimes like 0. Right now it has 0.1.

### You (2025-09-08T21:48:55.100Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:49:00.220Z)

That was my weekend.

### You (2025-09-08T21:49:02.620Z)

Okay. So. Yeah, it was. It was a good, well spent weekend, I'll give you that. So. No, this. This is actually. I hope. Yeah, let's. Let's. I hope you can show it tomorrow in our meeting because Diane and I, at our weekly catch up today.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:49:07.100Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:49:19.740Z)

And I think they're a little bit concerned about what Mark will have available to show in October because he's starting to get excited about it, putting together the pitch book and everything. And the emails. So I told her that, you know, you've been making some good progress. And in a worst case scenario, I can go back into the POC and change the styling to match. So we might just show bits and pieces. But that right there, I think that showing that there is a legitimate AI use case where you push the button. You get that? I mean, it's not like, type of thing. It's. It's kind of standard AI but it's there. So it's not like smoke and mirrors and so. Yeah, I think. I think that'll look good. So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:50:14.860Z)

And by the time we are in October, it's gonna look much better. We'll have the extraction pieces. Bit challenging, especially the amperage. The format that draw sent, right, that is straight up. Like it has header and then just data in one flow. In case of embrace, we have three headers.

### You (2025-09-08T21:50:30.700Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:50:33.820Z)

Horizontally, and then we have keys vertically. And that's bit challenging for any LLM. Forget our ocr, just cannot do it.

### You (2025-09-08T21:50:43.740Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:50:45.980Z)

But then we did try two and LLM. Now third one I'm hoping would work as we spent.

### You (2025-09-08T21:50:57.500Z)

Speaking of LLMs and going down a rabbit hole, I. Came across a brand new product. It's in beta, on GitHub. It's called dyad dyed. And basically it's somebody who built the front end. No code ide, and you just put in your own API key.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:51:24.060Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T21:51:24.780Z)

So all they're doing is they're just providing the front end and it's all local. So you can use there connection and database and have it totally local on your laptop. Or you can use the API key and you're just using your own data to go back and forth. It's lightning fast. It. I. I tried it this morning. I installed it, and it's a fraction. I mean, there's no. No subscription fees unless you want to use their models. As long as you use your own key, you can. You can hook it up to anything. So, you know, I had put in, what, hundred bucks a month or something for, for lovable. It's like, you know, the cost, you know, because showing your cost there at like 1.1 pennies, 1.1 cents. It is way, way cheaper to use your own API than it is to subscribe or use somebody else. 's. So, yeah, I think I might. I think I might just focus on that tool. So, anyway,

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:52:31.660Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:52:39.180Z)

Wanted to check it out. You can. I'll. I'll send you a link or whatever, but.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:52:44.620Z)

Surely. I mean, this looks good.

### You (2025-09-08T21:52:46.060Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:52:47.580Z)

With Bedrol. Bedrock has so many capabilities. I think we can do everything agent and everything in there. So yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:52:56.780Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:52:58.300Z)

I'm gonna give us.

### You (2025-09-08T21:52:59.900Z)

All right. I did finish up the. Well, I didn't finish up the formulas, prd. I finished integrating all of Drew's comments and changes. And as I was going through it, I'm thinking, okay, I'm. I'm. Yeah. Some of the changes Drew made, it's. It's. More. I think. I think he lost sight that that was for developers, and he was kind of, like, making corrections in it. That doesn't really matter. So I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna do now is I'm add a section at the end where I'm gonna have screenshots of where in the model in the poc that data is so they know exactly what we're referring. Like room revenue. You know, they don't know what room revenue is, but if I show them in the model, It might help with them to, you know, piece everything together. So I'm gonna need tomorrow to put those screenshots together. And that way I can show visually. How the floor needle is, how it works. You know some of the sample data that's in the model. And that should be ready to go. So I think we're. I think we're good on the PRDs. So now it's a matter of prioritizing, putting them in whatever order you feel is the best way to go through the development and go.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:54:28.060Z)

So I was thinking, would it be possible to probably set up at least one meeting with you and all of the engineering team once a week? Right? We'll go through. Where we are or anything you want to share, right? PRD document or AI roadmap. Or we might have questions or follow up on those meetings.

### You (2025-09-08T21:54:56.300Z)

No, that's a. That's a good idea. I know we've talked about it a few times, but we haven't moved forward with it yet, so, yeah, let's go ahead and put something together.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:55:07.020Z)

Let me ask these guys as well, and then I'll. I'll see. For me, especially during weekdays, it's like Friday. I'm quite open. But other days, like after, after 5:30, that's probably lead. And for these guys that's not even possible.

### You (2025-09-08T21:55:23.180Z)

Yeah, I don't think they want to get up at 2:00am yeah, no, I. If you schedule it on teams, you'll see my availability. And I have. Most of my mornings are wide open, so you just go choose.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:55:27.020Z)

Yeah. Well, I think your Friday would be best.

### You (2025-09-08T21:55:40.940Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:55:41.580Z)

And then probably these guys what have some flexibility in the evening to evenings, they generally work late. So, yeah, this would be available.

### You (2025-09-08T21:55:51.100Z)

Yeah. Yeah. All right. That's. That's fine. Just whatever you feel like doing, you know. Love to meet the new guy.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:55:58.700Z)

Yeah. It's cool.

### You (2025-09-08T21:56:03.980Z)

Speaking of new guy, did you. Did we ever figure out what's going on with the email and how we can add new users? Are you still working on that?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:56:13.180Z)

And I believe it is. Diane was supposed to provide me access. Which he hasn't done, I haven't followed, so I'll actually follow with her now. And see she could give me access. You? She said her husband was out and he'll do something.

### You (2025-09-08T21:56:31.180Z)

Yeah. Okay? And then did you see my email that I sent just to the four of us excluding and about the equity?

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:56:45.340Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:56:46.220Z)

I think. Did you reply to that? Did you just say. Yeah, that you. Whatever the minority is. Okay, all right.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:56:53.100Z)

I said, yeah, I'm fine either ways. So wherever everybody, like, you know, we have three people, then, yeah, we are good to go with that. Right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:56:59.660Z)

Drew replied back, and he wanted to complete the LLC agreement.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:57:07.020Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:57:08.380Z)

First, and then we'll look into that. I don't think he'll push back. But I have not heard anything from Mark, so, yeah, Mark is a little difficult to get through to. I'm having finding.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:57:20.300Z)

All right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:57:21.020Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:57:21.820Z)

Yeah. I mean, other day, right, when Tyne was saying that we are giving equal salaries to everyone, I was like, why is everyone asking? Even for salary, Right? Even, like, I know he will be very important. In future, but right now, it's like, you know, the work that we need to get done and the, you know, scenario about how we are everybody's situation.

### You (2025-09-08T21:57:46.380Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:57:48.300Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:57:49.340Z)

Diane and I talked about that afterwards, and we're both. Regretting not putting him on a commission.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:57:58.940Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:57:59.420Z)

Instead of a salary. He does not need a salary, right? Like the guy's got all sorts of money. But he needs incentive. And I'm wondering if, like. Okay, well, you know, if he got a percentage of all the money he raised.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:58:21.340Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:58:21.580Z)

Maybe he'd start sooner. Maybe he would start going out sooner and talking to people because he still pushes back on. Well, I can't talk to anybody until we have this or that's done. And, like, no, you know, we're here. What one is there? And it takes money to get from one to the other.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:58:44.460Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-09-08T21:58:45.980Z)

Like. I don't know how else to explain it, but yeah. But anyway, I mean, I don't resent him. I think he's good. I think in the end, it's, you know, wants things get rolling. It's. It's gonna be fine. But, yeah, he's, you know, he's got his own business he's running, and. You know, he's looking for certain things to be there before he. Tries to go out and encourage people to write a check so. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:59:16.460Z)

I saw something like everybody will work full time in this. But then I see Mark as many businesses. Drew has many businesses. They are running their business. They are not full time in this, right?

### You (2025-09-08T21:59:30.220Z)

Keep this between me and you. So Diane actually brought that up this morning.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:59:32.700Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T21:59:37.900Z)

She thought that the investor. In Drew's company was like an angel investor. Turned out it wasn't an investment, it was actually a loan.

### Guest (2025-09-08T21:59:53.260Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T21:59:57.500Z)

It kind of puts them in a position of, you know, being able to call the shots. Drew doesn't really have much of a saying in what's going on now because he's got to pay that loan back. So she. Does have no idea how this is going to play out yet. It's a little bit early, but we may either need some of the startup funds to pay off that loan. It's only 45,000. I mean, it's not like $250,000. It's 45. But that would release him from any obligation to them. But it's there. It's his data in their database. Alternatively, we may need to rebuild what he's got. Right. From the database standpoint. I don't think it's any big deal.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:00:57.100Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:00:58.300Z)

But he would have to replicate the mapping that he's done. And I told Diane that might not be a bad thing. You know, because the first time you go and do something, you make mistakes and you might have miss if he had an opportunity to go back and do it again, number one, he knows what works and what doesn't work, he could do it faster. And I told her, you know, with, with Vanoden, I. Here. Helping him, we may come up with something entirely new or, you know, and that. So. So she was like, yeah, that's. That's true. Maybe we should just. Try to. You know, maybe replicate what he's got. That would. That would certainly set us back. Release wise, but I don't. But yeah, she said that he's really thinking that he may have to go out of business if he doesn't get that. Client in Australia. So anyway, just.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:02:04.300Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:02:05.900Z)

Keep that to yourself at the same time.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:02:08.780Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-09-08T22:02:10.060Z)

Take a look at. I think you've already got. Do you have his database schema?

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:02:15.340Z)

No, no, I have nothing. He just shared few files, right? That's all.

### You (2025-09-08T22:02:19.100Z)

That's. That's what I thought. Yeah, but it can be complicated. His data is. He's getting it on a spreadsheet. So the database has got to be about as simple as can be. And we may already have a lot of the same tables set up account.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:02:20.460Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We can. We can have completely new database altogether. All it needs to do is just send that database across and we can host it on our Similar to what these Redx guys did with redIQ, right? So that I could just dump their SQL file into their SMTP or wherever on their S3 bucket. They just, you know, kind of migrated that over.

### You (2025-09-08T22:02:48.460Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I can't imagine that. The partner also owns the data. I would. I would. I would suspect that he would be able to extract the data. And transfer it over if things really do go bad. I don't know. But it's something to keep in mind.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:03:25.260Z)

Yeah. No, no, I'm. I don't know how much data he has and how much of that is going to be useful for us. But as a partner, probably he could add probably in C. Lot of network, I believe. But other thing is, like, if he could sell his own product, I don't know how he's gonna sell this one.

### You (2025-09-08T22:03:42.620Z)

Yeah. I mean. Yeah, yeah. But no, that. That, that's the point as well, is that they may be some of the easiest early customers to get if he's already doing business with him. Right. So, I mean, we don't want him to just. Put the padlock, the doors and walk away from it. We need to. We need the needle, we need the client.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:04:05.180Z)

No, no, we don't do.

### You (2025-09-08T22:04:08.220Z)

So, yeah, we'll figure it out. But she brought that up in our call this morning. So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:04:16.540Z)

Yeah. I just. I kind of want to develop the application and, you know, give it to the. Hand over to them. You know, go and pitch it and sell it or do whatever. And we'll continue doing our improvement, adding new features. The only problem I have is the time, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:04:37.180Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:04:40.140Z)

This. Like, I know this is a critical time for us, so I kind of. What you call sacrificed this entire summer or, you know, my family or me just going there. And probably it is worth it to. Right. The opportunity is huge and, you know, we are making something really solid.

### You (2025-09-08T22:05:04.540Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:05:05.180Z)

And hopefully this will, you know, give us some good result in future.

### You (2025-09-08T22:05:09.260Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean, hey, I submitted a resume last night. This first one I submitted, and probably two months, and it was. I. I know the company. I know some of the people. It would be a great position. And I'm like, what am I gonna do if they. If I make. Get an offer on this thing? And. But, yeah. I mean, it's like, can't go without money. So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:05:36.460Z)

Yeah, that's true. So we have raised what, 50k from 170k from other one, something like that.

### You (2025-09-08T22:05:45.180Z)

Yes. So the first one, the Mike Sherben, pledged 50.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:05:50.140Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:05:52.940Z)

And then the other company that she talked to. Where it was the father son one. I think there's 75. And then she also has somebody else who. I don't know if it's just a colleague in the business or what, but she did say it was some lady. That's been around for ever. But she only said that she wanted to invest. She didn't say how much.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:06:23.740Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T22:06:26.460Z)

We'll see how that goes. I don't know. When her next meeting is or what?

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:06:32.860Z)

So what's Diane's take on when you know, at what point she would like us to be full time on this? Like when Vita is 500k or 300? Something.

### You (2025-09-08T22:06:47.340Z)

I really think. That the first thing that we'll do with the funds is get us some money. Probably not enough to be full time employees.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:07:03.500Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:07:03.900Z)

Until we get. I mean, if we had. 200 or 250. I think we could. We could do that. But that's one thing I was thinking about this afternoon when I was driving back. It's like, we need to go through that budget and prioritize what is what, what do we absolutely have to have.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:07:20.380Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:07:24.380Z)

When we get money in the bank, what's the first thing that we're gonna do? And I think that at least a little bit of income would be good, but is there something else we need to do? Another higher. Do you need anything more on the back end?

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:07:30.860Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:07:45.260Z)

I'm not. Yeah, sure.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:07:47.740Z)

Simon, whatever experience I have got so far, right in this one and a half month. I could see that. I have to be on top of all this, otherwise, you know.

### You (2025-09-08T22:07:59.420Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:08:05.820Z)

All. Everybody gets stuck with these small things.

### You (2025-09-08T22:08:07.820Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:08:08.940Z)

So if I'm not there either, they are getting blocked. You know, there's no communication happening. There's a lot of communication. There's no guidance, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:08:22.300Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:08:23.740Z)

So unless I am slipping behind the computer, there's not much moving.

### You (2025-09-08T22:08:30.460Z)

No. And we are in agreement that you would be the first one. Right. So if we just had enough money for one full time employee, it would go to you. I've had conversations with Howard. It's like, yeah. I need income, but I don't need 150. I can. I. I can do kind of like Drew and Mark. Defer some of it, not all of it. But, you know, I could survive on this with my wife's income, at least than we'd have. A couple.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:09:06.060Z)

Yeah, yeah, that. That, I think will work out great. Because if you can probably, come on, say, 70% salary and then 30 differ or something like that, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:09:17.740Z)

I mean, I can do 50%. Not much less, but, you know, 50%.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:09:19.820Z)

Yeah. Yeah, for. Probably for six months, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:09:25.260Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:09:26.460Z)

In six months we'll have the product matured a lot. We are working full time.

### You (2025-09-08T22:09:31.340Z)

Yeah. But I do know Diana's hurting as well.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:09:36.860Z)

Oh, yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:09:37.820Z)

But with. With her husband. And everything that's going on. That they. They're in not a good place. So hopefully we can get her as well. I would, you know, if I have, you would be number one.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:09:47.980Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-08T22:09:56.140Z)

And. And hopefully there'd be enough left over to get her some money. And then I would fall into third. And we'll go from there, but we'll see.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:10:06.780Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I really didn't think of dying. Yeah. I don't know her situation. But yeah, let's see. I wish. Like if there was some part time or something I could do.

### You (2025-09-08T22:10:23.900Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:10:25.100Z)

Then that would that put us in a better situation? I know this guy. What was his name? Our VP product. I don't remember his name. You are reporting into him, right? What is his name? Look, look, look.

### You (2025-09-08T22:10:45.980Z)

Oh, luke. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:10:48.460Z)

At contact. Let me probably couple of months back he was saying there was some part time work, but he was like, so once a week or something like that. Okay. I don't know how much that's gonna earn, but probably I reach out to him again, see if there's more like two days or you. Know, four hours every day.

### You (2025-09-08T22:10:59.820Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:11:07.740Z)

Then that would be great.

### You (2025-09-08T22:11:09.180Z)

I'd like to get caught up with him. I. We were speaking fairly regularly right after the layoffs, but as soon as he got a new job, he. He. We haven't really touched base, so. Yeah. It's been a while.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:11:24.620Z)

Yeah, he was. He was kind of struggling. Just keep it between both of us. But he was just struggling to find a job as well. He didn't have J.

### You (2025-09-08T22:11:32.140Z)

He kept me up to date with all the things that were going on. How? He had an offer for MOD company, but then they never came through with the written offer and he was waiting. Like, six weeks on that. And, yeah, he had a rough time. I know.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:11:47.820Z)

He is doing a startup right now, healthcare startup. Yeah. You knew Darren. There's a guy there. And I don't know whether you were there when Darren was there in Berkadia. He was a top guy.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:02.780Z)

Doesn't ring.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:04.300Z)

Yeah, just under CEO. So his startup. Some health startup.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:14.460Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:15.500Z)

They are doing.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:16.460Z)

Cool. Yeah, I think I'll make a little note to. Touch base with him tomorrow, see if I can get all through.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:24.140Z)

Yeah. Maybe some part time opportunity. That would work out great.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:28.780Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:30.220Z)

Let's see.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:31.180Z)

Yep. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:32.700Z)

The other thing is if I don't have to go right like based on more than it takes a lot of time, like still just state my entire day.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:37.980Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:41.820Z)

If it was removed, then. Like I could devote lot more time.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:47.740Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:49.020Z)

Yeah. Then, like, come four days, and that is overkilling.

### You (2025-09-08T22:12:52.220Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:12:55.420Z)

Let's see. Let's see. Quick. I know it's already 6:12. We are over time. But about that LLC, right? Am I the one with blocking that?

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:09.580Z)

I'll watch one.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:11.420Z)

LLC or whatever you are supposed to do for llc. Is it me who is blocking that?

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:17.820Z)

No. No. Drew and Diane were still going over some of the.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:24.300Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:24.300Z)

Questions on that, so. No, she. She expects to have that and the pitch deck ready to go by Friday. And actually, I think Drew is the one that's having his attorney review the llc.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:41.260Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:42.620Z)

So, yeah, I think. I think it's all up to him.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:42.780Z)

Got.

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:44.700Z)

Though.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:47.980Z)

Cha got? Cha. From my perspective, I think if, you know, I am not mentioned anywhere in LLC and it's my wife's name, I think I should be fine.

### You (2025-09-08T22:13:58.060Z)

Ok?

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:13:59.180Z)

And then, you know, working while will continue working through that company right now. In future, when we can transfer visa over, we can think about that.

### You (2025-09-08T22:14:05.340Z)

Yeah. All right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:14:11.020Z)

Then we don't have to do extra 10k expense, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:14:15.580Z)

Yeah. Yeah, that's. That's the last. That's the less I heard. She just kind of gave a quick update this morning, so. Drew and Mark are taking the lead on the pitch book. Tweaking some of the stuff that went through. And then I think you saw Mark's email that said, you know, don't, don't. Don't bother reviewing it until he and Drew finish, and we'll go from there. So, yeah, there's nothing really for you and I to do on. Either one of those at this point.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:14:51.580Z)

All right. So from the development perspective, right, the only blocker kind of thing we have, right? Or not block. I mean, we are actively. Developing and doing some research is the data extraction part. It's challenging as well. I mean, that format is quite complex.

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:11.020Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:15:11.740Z)

Embrace and even Davidson us alli format is straightforward that we can do with any OCR we are able to do even through ocr Impede one is the most complicated one.

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:21.100Z)

Ok? Ay.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:15:24.460Z)

And I don't want to get stuck in that rule based thing, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:27.420Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:15:29.340Z)

So that is the approach. You know, we are kind of, we are just doing it through LLMs. I don't want to have road based engines like we add AndroidIQ.

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:40.140Z)

Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's. I know that's gonna be a challenge.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:15:47.500Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:47.740Z)

And that's the thing that we have to get right.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:15:50.780Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-08T22:15:51.420Z)

First time. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. If. If we need more time and can't get it by October 6th. It is what it is. But I even told Diane, even if we have one format that's working for a demo, we can do it. We don't have to take multiple formats and show them. We can just take, you know, here. Here's our operating financial statement. We drag it and drop it and look it. Extracts everything.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:16:06.940Z)

Eah. Okay? Did we also have this valuation part as part of the mvp?

### You (2025-09-08T22:16:31.340Z)

Yes. Yeah. Yeah, so.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:16:36.140Z)

Okay, so in the valuation, we just should have the form, right? Just these. Forms, or we need this data showing up down here as well.

### You (2025-09-08T22:16:46.300Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Because it's the information that you input above will populate the theta down there, and that's where a lot of the formulas are located.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:16:59.020Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T22:16:59.820Z)

There in the investment summary.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:02.300Z)

Got you.

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:02.620Z)

Yeah. So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:05.420Z)

Investment summary. This one. Okay.

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:07.740Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:12.220Z)

So let's go to sounds good.

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:14.780Z)

Now, unfortunately, not all of those numbers down in the bottom half are actual calculations. Some of them are just hard coded data.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:25.020Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:26.780Z)

So I was thinking, if it will help, I can go back in and make those calculations. But I think the only way that's going to help is if we actually go into the code. And I don't. I don't.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:41.180Z)

Yeah. No. Yeah. No, we are not really going in the code. We are just going through PRD document formulas. And then whatever is in this poc.

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:50.140Z)

That's what I thought. So that kind of goes back to what I was saying, that if I can show them where the data is coming from,

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:17:58.700Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T22:17:59.100Z)

Visually so that they don't. Because? Because I know what we have in the formula is not the same as the database name. So I did say the ud field. They won't know what to look for it in the database. But I think if they see where in the tool, then they might be able to. It's like, oh, yeah, that's over here. So.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:18:22.460Z)

Sounds good. So tomorrow. Your calendar is up to date for tomorrow, right?

### You (2025-09-08T22:18:28.940Z)

Yep, yep. I put everything into the teams calendar. And then I on my, I'm still, I'm, I'm using the Apple Calendar to combine that, my Gmail and a few other things. So. But if there's anything that I have outside of. InnVestAI I still add it into the team s and just make it a private appointment so you can still see the time blocked off.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:19:01.500Z)

I'll try to schedule it for tomorrow. Probably we can go through the poc, perform formulas. Probably. Let's do it for one hour. And if it goes beyond little that we buy.

### You (2025-09-08T22:19:13.100Z)

Okay? That'll work. Just let me know.

### Guest (2025-09-08T22:19:17.820Z)

Thank you. Thanks a lot.

### You (2025-09-08T22:19:20.460Z)

Have a good evening. We'll see. You.
