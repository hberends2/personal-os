### Guest (2025-04-28T15:00:49.371Z)

Hey.

### You (2025-04-28T15:00:49.913Z)

Good morning.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:00:54.481Z)

Good morning. How are you?

### You (2025-04-28T15:00:55.583Z)

I'm doing well. My apologies for all the notetakers, but I'm actually doing some side by side comparisons. So I hope you don't mind.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:01:05.491Z)

No. Oh my gosh. I love that you're note taking. Thank you. It really makes a big difference. So thank you for all of that.

### You (2025-04-28T15:01:10.483Z)

Well, no. I I I I tell people that I have ADHD which I actually very much so do. And it's impossible for me. I I it's like, I can either participate in the call or I can take notes, and my notes are horrible. I can't I can't do both. So for me, AI has been a

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:01:32.841Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-04-28T15:01:32.843Z)

tremendous black thing for taking notes. It does that's it it's probably one thing that it does really, really well, including

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:01:44.981Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:01:45.193Z)

Microsoft Teams. So that's one thing I found before is that even just using the recording function in teams and then using Copilot to put together a summary and everything and action items. I mean, it really picks up the details very well. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:00.631Z)

That's good. I was last week, I was

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:01.603Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:04.101Z)

traveling all week. It's the first time I've traveled since I took this part time job.

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:06.763Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:09.071Z)

And I was in DC Baltimore at property review meetings, right, just like the multifamily side has. Our the hotel ones go a little bit longer.

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:14.253Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:17.711Z)

We talked for quite a while. I was so wishing we could have just it because this week, I'm working on quarterly reports.

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:24.853Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:24.891Z)

And I'm like, I bet AI could have written this quarterly report me based on everything we talked about. Right? Instead, I'm sitting there, like, going back through my

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:30.013Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:32.701Z)

nose and saying, yes. So

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:34.453Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:34.691Z)

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:37.763Z)

Well, I will send you a link to

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:02:39.361Z)

our company.

### You (2025-04-28T15:02:43.043Z)

one of the notetakers that I've tried, which I'm also very impressed with, but it's it is a enterprise level. It's not something that individuals use. I just happen to with one of the newsletters I subscribed to, you got a free year of the tools so I haven't paid for it but it's one that just goes off of the computer microphone So you it doesn't have to be an online meeting. You can record know, if you're just sitting in a conference room. And it'll take all the notes and everything too. I haven't tried it that way. I've

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:03:18.911Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-04-28T15:03:19.483Z)

only used it online, but

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:03:20.221Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-04-28T15:03:21.183Z)

there there are some out there that you could you could probably do that. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:03:24.021Z)

That's great. And and yes. Yep. That's great. So

### You (2025-04-28T15:03:25.243Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:03:28.891Z)

### You (2025-04-28T15:03:55.193Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:03:55.761Z)

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:06:21.571Z)

stuff that I, you know, I couldn't get done last week when I was traveling. So so I'm playing catch up today and tomorrow. Writing quarterly reports, which I despise.

### You (2025-04-28T15:06:31.763Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:06:33.901Z)

My part time job and then getting catch up on all the InvestAI stuff that I missed last

### You (2025-04-28T15:06:34.333Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:06:38.871Z)

week, all the emails and everything. The website looks so good. Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:06:47.083Z)

Yeah. I think he did a really good job.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:06:55.571Z)

Did the review of the underwriting on Thursday help to go to kind of in your mind, understand the process, what's first, what's second, what's third?

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:06.643Z)

Yeah. Unfortunately, we didn't quite get to that part.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:10.561Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:11.403Z)

So so we'd yeah. We're gonna have to have more calls

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:12.881Z)

did it

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:14.993Z)

I know Drew is trying to document stuff, but yeah. All those questions that Mark had kinda took us down I wouldn't I wouldn't say they were rabbit holes, but we

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:24.071Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:24.703Z)

had to go through all of that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:25.881Z)

Again,

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:26.153Z)

before we got to there. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:28.001Z)

Right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe just a we can get through it, maybe just we if you have some time this week, maybe you, Drew, and I can go through it or just you and I can go through it and

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:37.233Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:40.371Z)

focus exactly on the on just the underwriting piece to make sure we, you know,

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:42.943Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:07:44.651Z)

bulldoze through that part of it.

### You (2025-04-28T15:07:45.793Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I think it would be really good because now that we have the the invest teams account, I can use teams to record. That's the thing. The the ones that I'm using right now are only recording the audio transcripts.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:03.431Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:08:05.463Z)

But with the the with the teams, I can get a video so I can kinda watch

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:09.591Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-04-28T15:08:10.073Z)

and I can always then go back and

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:11.291Z)

right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:08:12.733Z)

review know, because sometimes you'd always get where where did he click? You know? How did they get that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:17.451Z)

Oh, yes.

### You (2025-04-28T15:08:18.153Z)

screen up there? So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:19.201Z)

Yeah. So that so what you're saying is now that we're we'll have Teams, you can record when Drew

### You (2025-04-28T15:08:19.573Z)

yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:08:24.561Z)

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:09:06.341Z)

### You (2025-04-28T15:09:09.423Z)

Yeah. No. I saw you looking over to the side like I like you're on another

Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:27.381Z)

so how do we do this? Let's see. Drew,

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:30.203Z)

That's what I was that's what I was wondering. And and what about Mark?

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:30.401Z)

think for now, Drew doesn't need one.

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:34.933Z)

Does Mark need one? For now?

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:38.381Z)

Well, I'd say yes, but we might be able to get away without that

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:44.623Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:45.001Z)

for just a little bit of time, or I can ask Mark to pick it up on his own.

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:49.053Z)

Well, look.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:49.971Z)

So I could pay, yeah, I could pay for Vinod, because he's doing I mean, he's just doing so much work for you know? And then

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:53.493Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:12:56.611Z)

maybe what I do is we don't do one for Drew, and then I ask Mark to

### You (2025-04-28T15:12:57.533Z)

Well, let

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:00.531Z)

pick up his own.

### You (2025-04-28T15:13:02.043Z)

let me ask them. I think it'd be easier if I were know, because I already mentioned that that I'll go ahead and pick up the the tab from mine. I'll just send an email to to the note and Mark asking if

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:13.171Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:13:13.823Z)

they could do the same. They're they're not gonna say no. The problem is we'll have to pay you

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:17.841Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:13:19.513Z)

So because you you've got your pay PayPal account near the the admin

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:21.971Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-04-28T15:13:24.183Z)

So we we there's no way that Vinod or Mark could log in to GoDaddy and get their own account. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:25.141Z)

Okay. Got it. But then you guys could Venmo me it. Right? Like,

### You (2025-04-28T15:13:30.633Z)

yeah. So down there, Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:13:34.291Z)

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:14:29.871Z)

But I can just after we get off the phone, I can just go in and

### You (2025-04-28T15:14:31.683Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:14:34.361Z)

fix this. And then once I do this, what do then what do I do? Do I just set up their emails and

### You (2025-04-28T15:14:38.033Z)

Yes. It's

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:14:39.331Z)

send it out to them?

### You (2025-04-28T15:14:39.643Z)

it's very simple. All you'll do is you'll you'll go in there to continue to add the users. You just put down their existing email, And then but you it'll it'll ask you to create a password, a temporary password, because the first time they log in, they'll have to create a password. But there's also a link there that says, let GoDaddy generate something. So you don't have to think of a password. You can

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:15:04.471Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:15:05.543Z)

just click on that button, It'll create a password out of thin air, and then they'll get an email saying you've been invited to set up your account. So all they have to do is click on there, It'll bring them up to and I just did the first name. So I did Howard at

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:15:18.721Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-04-28T15:15:20.683Z)

There, you can just do Mark in the node.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:15:22.031Z)

So that's gonna be our protocol. It's just the first name at

### You (2025-04-28T15:15:23.643Z)

Well, you can always you can you can set up more aliases.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:15:25.221Z)

invest a I dot com. Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:15:28.333Z)

So you can always have, you know, h barons, howard dot barons info, sales. You know, you can create all those different accounts. And and they're not considered a user, So we can you can always do that for no additional cost. But so, yeah, I don't I don't think it's it matters. I'm just saying that I think, you because you've got a Diane that and I've then I've got a Howard at. Yeah. Yeah. So Might as

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:15:54.361Z)

I have both. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So so we're just gonna be that's perfect. Just keep it the same. That's consistency, right, is good.

### You (2025-04-28T15:16:00.943Z)

yeah. Yeah. Now when when we're dealing with yeah. When we're dealing with external clients,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:16:02.801Z)

So people don't get confused.

### You (2025-04-28T15:16:06.283Z)

probably wanna get something a little bit more formal. We can set up aliases, but

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:16:07.751Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:16:10.443Z)

for the time being, I think that's perfect. So yeah. So once you once you have confirmation that they've been added, then you just simply go in there and like I said, put in their name, email, click the button to automatically generate a password, click on send, and it's done. That's it.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:16:29.921Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:16:30.413Z)

Now I did not send out anything to anybody else regarding that. So I think what you got, you know, because in your email, you said thanks for note sending everybody, but think you were the only one that received that. It's probably because of what I did by setting up the team site

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:16:45.311Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:16:47.363Z)

So, you know, that's one thing. Think that once that's done, once they do have their email addresses, then you can send out an email to every everybody and say, you know, make the announcement. And go from there. But I'll I'll contact the note and Mark regarding the payment.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:03.421Z)

Thank you. I appreciate that.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:04.363Z)

So yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:06.681Z)

And, again, in a normal circumstance, I wouldn't even blink twice about this.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:07.043Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:10.001Z)

It's just, like, the luck of the draw is that Mike happens to

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:10.113Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:13.531Z)

you know, be in the job. Well, he just took a new job, but he doesn't start until May 15.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:17.003Z)

Okay. Also, if

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:18.291Z)

So

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:20.723Z)

now I know I've got a Venmo account. I don't know about about Mark or or Vinod. I'm assuming they they probably do. But if you wanna send me your account information so I can go ahead and make the payment, and then I can even

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:30.331Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:32.633Z)

include that in the email so that they can just do it. If they have the account. If not, then we'll figure something out.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:36.651Z)

Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thank you for figuring all of this out.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:44.593Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So the only

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:47.301Z)

So I do you have

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:48.513Z)

I was gonna say the only other thing you had mentioned in the email is that you had set up a Trello

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:17:49.231Z)

go ahead.

### You (2025-04-28T15:17:55.963Z)

So so Vinod and I have to have the Jira account The confluence is optional. But they're they're both free for up to five users. So I went ahead and signed up and created an Invest AI account for Jira and Confluence.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:18:15.581Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:18:16.363Z)

And with Confluence, Trello's included for free So so that way, we do actually have an invest

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:18:21.461Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:18:26.203Z)

AI

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:18:26.541Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:18:27.053Z)

worksite team site, for Jira and Confluence and Trello. So in fact, I will

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:18:34.721Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:18:36.053Z)

actually take the screen real quick and I'm gonna show you what I what I did here. Okay. So you should be seeing my Teams site. You see

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:18:59.821Z)

Let me let me minimize

### You (2025-04-28T15:19:01.993Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:19:04.441Z)

hold on one second. Can we just minimize this back? I'm just gonna figure it out when I get back there. And then

### You (2025-04-28T15:19:17.563Z)

Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:19:18.441Z)

teams, yes, I see it.

### You (2025-04-28T15:19:20.883Z)

So the way that I've got this set up now you can set this up various ways, but down here is the teams and channels.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:19:28.201Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:19:31.423Z)

And so there's the Invest AI team and a general and this is what you actually created.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:19:35.621Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:19:37.173Z)

So I right? So on the general tab, here, let me get rid of this. That's taking up space. You can add things up here. So I put a post on here, you know, welcome to the team site, and then I added some tabs at the top. So the first one or we've got the files tab. Where you'll see that I uploaded

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:19:57.781Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:00.363Z)

all the or I created some different folders, so development

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:02.881Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:03.803Z)

will be where Vinod will keep some of his documents, you know, when we start marketing, valuation model, and when I click into that, you know, I've got all of the documents that you sent to me and and everything else

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:13.991Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:15.743Z)

So so we should just for best practices, start keeping all documents here. Okay? And if there's something that you don't want to share, of course, don't upload it.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:25.411Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:29.883Z)

If there's, you know, you know, with the with the financing or anything you're working on. But

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:31.271Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:35.813Z)

notes is also there by default, but this Invest AI will

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:41.041Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:42.583Z)

sync with Trello. So, you know, here's the Trello board

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:46.341Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:47.573Z)

that that I put together right now. And this is just a sample, but what I wanted to do is, you know, here's the idealist. And this is where we could add

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:20:58.541Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:20:58.733Z)

any idea that we wanna include, any feature whether it's now or whether it's five years from now.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:21:02.891Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:21:05.953Z)

And then what we would do is we would go through and then prioritize them like this is what we have to do now. Then we would do this, and then we'll do this later. And there's some that we just

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:21:16.361Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:21:17.313Z)

may not wanna do. Right? These client or these ideas will come from not only us, when we start getting some beta clients and testers and everybody else

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:21:24.601Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:21:27.683Z)

and they say, hey, wow, it'd be nice if we could do this, you know, we'll just add a card here,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:21:32.161Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:21:33.383Z)

and the reason I want to do this under the NINVEST is because Trello also links with Jira.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:21:39.381Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:21:40.313Z)

So when we create this idea and we want to know to go ahead and start working on it, we could add all the information that we could hear in in the Trello card. We could then send that into Jira, and it's automatically created. So you don't have to have one in two different places and to have that it integrated level of integration is very helpful. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:06.501Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:07.953Z)

so you can

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:10.811Z)

So is this how we create a product road map then?

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:13.953Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:14.411Z)

Like, that, you know, the the the so, like, the proof of

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:18.723Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:19.541Z)

Right? I mean, it's very, very basic. It's the scooter, and we include what's on the

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:20.073Z)

Right. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:23.851Z)

of concept. And then we say in the next three months, we're gonna tackle these couple of things. So that we have when we go to start to speak to investors, we can show them what

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:30.563Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We can.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:33.911Z)

our product road map is.

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:35.383Z)

Mean, there's multiple ways of doing that. Jira has a very good road map functionality, but you're not used to working in Jira, it it's really a product for engineering teams.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:22:48.871Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:22:49.563Z)

And they're the ones so, like, every feature that they work on, it's all documented to code. That's where they do everything. So for myself, I mean, I can work in it. I've taken some very basic courses, but even you know, I still kind of fumble around trying to find things. It's it's not as intuitive as what we would like. Confluence also has a road map Confluence is like the documentation part, so you can create whiteboards, you can create documents, you know, customer service, a lot of things would use Confluence. So that's where you can upload documents as well. But not necessarily everything. And that has a road map feature. Or we can use Trello. And you can create multiple boards. Right? So in the team site, you just have one tab that goes to a particular Trello board. But if I had another Trello board like, a Rev, I could just click on here, add that one, see Trello is the first one that comes up in the top left. If I click on that, I had another board, it would have a list of all the boards. I could click it. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:03.771Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:06.283Z)

know, so so, yeah, you could have you know, this tab, then you could have a a link to the Trello road map tab. Also your Gantt chart. I I think you did the plan anyway. Which is actually very good. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:24.911Z)

So I yeah. Right. I up

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:25.053Z)

I said, anyway, it's actually a really good tool. We started to use it at at Radix.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:28.351Z)

upgraded a little bit in I'm sorry. What'd you say? Go ahead.

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:30.723Z)

I haven't used it much. We just started using it

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:31.741Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:35.423Z)

like, around December, January, right before the layoffs. So but but you can you can do

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:43.671Z)

Okay. Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:46.003Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:47.231Z)

And could you tell that I had that? Or because I did some sort of upgrade

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:49.813Z)

Yeah. I think because I was a member of that board, I got a a

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:24:52.701Z)

that I could add in Gantt charts.

### You (2025-04-28T15:24:54.613Z)

an email to click and link and add it to my to the board. But Play Anyway has really good Gantt chart

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:04.011Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:04.963Z)

things and because it's been part of Trello, then you don't have to go back and forth between different products. So you sent a link to let me take a look here. What is it called? The TeamGantt. Which looks very nice, but I do think we could do the same thing using the the planny way if we wanna do that.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:26.361Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:30.013Z)

So I think the only thing we would need to do is I I think the plan anyway, if

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:33.491Z)

And

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:33.933Z)

it's under your name, we would want to

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:34.671Z)

planning way. Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:36.643Z)

set one up under Invest AI. I I don't I don't remember how you had it set up. But yeah. K.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:45.401Z)

Okay. Okay. I will go back and figure that out. And it's probably fine that just you and I have access to

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:52.843Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:55.191Z)

to do you think it's fine that just you and I have access to that

### You (2025-04-28T15:25:56.213Z)

Yeah. No. Not and yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:25:59.621Z)

planning way Gantt charting? Because we're gonna be the ones doing it. Right? I don't

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:01.383Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:03.781Z)

Mark getting in here and doing that. Drew won't do it, and and Vinod has

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:04.573Z)

Yeah. Vinod would not want to or we shouldn't

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:08.241Z)

some he has Jira. Right? Which yep. Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:08.403Z)

even have him change the road map It should be a group decision anyway. So know, you we we could set up a meeting. You

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:19.491Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:19.813Z)

could have it on your screen, and then we would discuss it. And then if we, as a team, decide say, well, we're gonna do this feature before that one, then then we would control it. So yeah, that's that's one tool that does not need to be made available to everyone. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:37.481Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:38.613Z)

It is.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:41.901Z)

Alright. This is so this is, like, this is real. This

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:42.353Z)

Yeah. Vinod and I were talking. It's like know, he was lucky to find a job. I have gotten, like,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:26:46.331Z)

is so exciting.

### You (2025-04-28T15:26:49.983Z)

zero callbacks. I I I had one. Response to a resume where I just applied to an ad, and it was you know, too late It was actually very, very similar to to what we're doing. In the self storage area. But I had a good really good conversation with the

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:27:09.571Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:27:11.213Z)

recruiter. He was like, yeah. I gotta get you in front of the hiring manager. We set up a time in the, like, thirty minutes before the call. I get an email saying, we've we've already extended an offer to somebody and and, like, yeah. Well, yeah, it it it it is.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:27:28.631Z)

Oh, no. Oh, that's awful.

### You (2025-04-28T15:27:29.023Z)

But, you know, it's it's one of those things, and I'm like, okay. That's that's fine. But yeah, there's just I have not found one single

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:27:34.401Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-04-28T15:27:36.593Z)

opening in the prop tech space, and all of the other jobs outside the

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:27:43.741Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:27:43.793Z)

know, there's one or two critical items that I'm missing and then some, like, you know, I send them in just to make sure that I'm doing something. But we we we both have decided that, you know, this what we wanna do. We wanna make sure that this thing gets going and

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:27:59.341Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:00.393Z)

so so yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:28:05.481Z)

This is this is completely doable in the hotels. We don't have anything like it. No competition whatsoever. And, you know, I was thinking about what my friend Jen said, and she's like,

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:18.183Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:28:18.851Z)

go for family office money first. And so I've just been thinking through the Pritz or family office money. One of Drew clients,

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:26.833Z)

Yeah.

Woodbine, are the Scovels, they're family money.

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:29.263Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:28:31.031Z)

The Rodriguezes are family money. The Uberos are family money. You know what I mean? So there's,

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:34.043Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:28:35.701Z)

the Tishes are family so I probably have five actual family offices. In the hotel space that I'll I'll, like, go first. To see if know, because less predatory and things like that. And then I had lunch on Friday. With this amazing young man that works he worked for

### You (2025-04-28T15:28:53.463Z)

K. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:28:54.931Z)

oh, he's he's by background, he's a project manager in the construction space. So, right, he project managed multi developments and hotel developments. But he moved into a software sales job at

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:05.343Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:09.681Z)

Rabbit, which is, like, construction, modeling

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:10.663Z)

Good. So

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:13.931Z)

And then now he's at a company called Taylor Bird, And I think one of his colleagues

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:17.523Z)

k.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:20.071Z)

worked at Red IQ. So he was checking that just to see if if there was a connection there. But he's selling software for Taylor Bird,

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:27.383Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:28.271Z)

and he likes it. He's just, you know,

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:29.503Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:30.891Z)

he's like you, it's like, you know, software is

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:31.283Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:33.911Z)

gonna be replaced. Soft you know, he didn't quite say software is dead, but like, we really need to think through how AI is gonna impact the space. And he told me what he wanted to do, which is a bit more on the consulting side. But what I would like, when I walked away from that lunch, it was like, oh my god. Like, to

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:49.993Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:50.341Z)

if we could bring him on at some point to just say,

### You (2025-04-28T15:29:51.463Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:29:53.471Z)

you own the CapEx and the, you know, capital side of this and go figure out the Procore and how to overlay like, a hotel module on top of it. You know?

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:05.493Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:06.951Z)

But what one thing he wants to do is help companies with their real estate companies with their tech stack.

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:13.123Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:15.841Z)

Because so many real estate companies just don't what they need. You know, the RD has been there forever, and and so

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:22.933Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:23.321Z)

how do you go from a property management system

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:26.193Z)

No. That would be very helpful.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:26.401Z)

to an asset management to Yardi, you know, then up to Juniper Square?

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:28.133Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:30.111Z)

And that's something he wants to do. And there I mean, that yeah.

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:33.993Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:34.551Z)

Yeah. So okay. Well, great. Howard, I'm gonna purchase these two email accounts and get that out. And then oh, I know. I wanted to ask you.

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:47.433Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:47.591Z)

I was researching because Mark was, you know, telling me that he really feels like the tracking thing is very important.

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:54.043Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:55.281Z)

And I reminded him what we talked about on our call

### You (2025-04-28T15:30:58.543Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:30:59.011Z)

that tracking is completely possible within our

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:02.053Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:02.781Z)

website domain. Right? But once an Excel model exits,

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:03.273Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:07.391Z)

our domain, we have no way of knowing what's happening to that ex Excel file. He didn't remember that, which is which is fine. But I just googled really quickly, like, does Excel have tracking

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:18.503Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:19.771Z)

And I did get one response that said, yes. Although it

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:22.163Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:24.381Z)

sometimes makes you disable things like conditional formatting and and things like that. Mean, is there a way, like, if if a customer turned on that tracking

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:34.143Z)

The

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:34.181Z)

that we could at least pull that up into our domain and take no

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:36.073Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:38.611Z)

responsibility whatsoever for it. You know what I mean? A massive

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:38.623Z)

There's there's two ways of of doing this without actually tracking.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:31:41.991Z)

saying, we didn't do this, but no.

### You (2025-04-28T15:31:46.603Z)

Within Excel, I'm not concerned about tracking, you know, what worksheet do they go to, what cell do they click on. I just want that data. Whatever may changes they made, I want that to come back into our tool. Otherwise, you know, that's when I when I talk about it being a black hole, that's that's what I'm referring to is we push the data out if we are if we include the ability to export to Excel and that's where we lose control. This wants that data goes out there. We can have a two way sync.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:32:20.531Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:32:21.193Z)

Process in in Excel. There there's two ways to go about this. Number one, we just have our own Excel model. Which people may or may not want. Right? I I think hotel is a little bit different than multifamily because multifamily you can have you know, single investors that go out and buy a fourplex. Or something like that. Who may not have their own spreadsheets. That comes in great there, but I think when you talk about

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:32:55.001Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:32:57.093Z)

institutional and more sophisticated, they're not gonna wanna give up their spreadsheet. So that's the same as the the the add in that we had called quick sync at Red IQ, where they would create the deal in Rede IQ, all of the information and then push that button and it gets sent into their spreadsheet. The way that works is somebody at Red IQ has to work with them and they have to go in and create the connection between the data and this particular cells in their spreadsheet that that relates to. And so you know, there's that portion of it. And so to get that data back from a client spreadsheet is way more difficult. And they would have to be basically synced on demand. Which means the client would have to push a button to send that information back into our database.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:00.401Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:05.063Z)

So we have we have no way of enforcing that, you know, If they just download the data and they do everything in Excel,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:09.491Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:11.293Z)

and they decide not to,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:12.841Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:14.623Z)

nothing we can do. So what we really need to do is discourage Excel.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:20.391Z)

Mhmm. Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:22.703Z)

And you know, there's a lot of arguments that we can put in front of people and I think, you know,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:27.221Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:28.493Z)

you mentioned even in the call, you know, all the different errors and people changing formulas and all that. Know, that's one of the biggest things that we can

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:35.711Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:37.813Z)

talk about, plus the versioning, plus teams being able to work on it. So there's a lot of advantages to not using Excel, and we have to do everything we can to

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:48.881Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:50.243Z)

to kind of nudge people in that direction. Otherwise, there's always gonna be that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:34:57.421Z)

I think

### You (2025-04-28T15:34:57.773Z)

potential of having different data in our system versus what they have in Excel. And you know, by by the end of the process, we don't know we won't know what their cap rate would be. We don't know what their their metrics are because they sit in Excel. We may know the deal name and address and all that other information that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:35:17.261Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:35:20.343Z)

put in, but if they choose not to sync back, it it it puts us in a position where we we just have that hole in our database because that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:35:28.921Z)

Right. And you saw the because you worked

### You (2025-04-28T15:35:37.543Z)

No. No. It's not. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:35:39.861Z)

much in the model, you saw the inputs tab. It's not really complicated. Right? It's like a POR, a PAR percentages.

### You (2025-04-28T15:35:46.423Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:35:48.001Z)

What where the complication comes is really, like, take a department like food and beverage. Right, where you have all this comp like, for a for a select service hotel, food and beverage is nothing. Right? But for a full service hotel that has catering and outlets,

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:01.403Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:36:03.411Z)

you have to kind of so it's almost like your idea that eventually we'll have worksheets. That are are attached almost. Right? But you'll be doing

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:10.153Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:36:11.371Z)

the side analysis and a worksheet, and the benefit of doing it in our environment is you don't mean to go

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:15.543Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:36:17.821Z)

manipulate all that granular data is horrific. Right? So if we can manipulate the data into the best possible

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:25.983Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:36:27.661Z)

format for the client to do their side analysis.

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:28.623Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And the way I visualize it is

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:36:32.091Z)

Then I I think that will help to get people into our model. Right?

### You (2025-04-28T15:36:33.373Z)

when you're when you first create a deal, Right? So this deal gets on the market. I'm an investor. I go in there and I wanna add it into my Invest AI account. And what we would do is we would just basically have a a form where they start filling in the basic information then they start filling in their basic assumptions. And that's what I wanted to do when I observed you and Drew is to find out which which order do we do that? But on the left side navigation, I would wanna have tabs that kinda correlate to all

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:37:05.401Z)

Mhmm. This right. Yep.

### You (2025-04-28T15:37:08.373Z)

all that. Right? So they put in their initial assumptions and then there's a spot on the screen where it shows all of the the the major metrics, the KPIs that I'm looking for. And if I say, oh, you know, my return on investment is not what I need it to be, then they can just jump to whatever. You know, if I wanted if I wanna if I want to make modifications to my food and beverage, I click on the food and beverage tab. Then that comes up there Much more granular detail, and that's where I can go and make tweaks. And and as I change a number, in this cell at the top of the page, I can see the results of that change.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:37:45.091Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:37:47.293Z)

In Excel, that's that's one problem you don't have because you have to change it in a cell you have to go click on, like, the summary tab and say, oh, okay. Nope. Then, you know, back

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:37:54.081Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:37:56.993Z)

forth, back and forth. And so you know, again, that's the

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:37:59.841Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:00.993Z)

that would make the sale of this product

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:02.371Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:03.723Z)

very easy because you can show that you know, you're just gonna save them hours and hours of labor by doing something like this. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:15.681Z)

Mhmm. Right. And then the one thing, though, is we'll have to work with Drew on that to get

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:21.293Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:22.731Z)

the data in that. And he had well, I don't want I I don't wanna over I feel like maybe I'm overstating what

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:24.883Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:27.701Z)

Drew has. Drew only has 2,500 hotels in his database. Right? So I maybe I'm speaking too much about

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:31.593Z)

Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:35.361Z)

what but but what Drew has done is not something I would wanna go try to recreate. Like, he spent five years trying to create the piping. Right? And it it's all right. It is literally like piping. And so

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:46.773Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:47.951Z)

hit that data works so much better if it

### You (2025-04-28T15:38:50.683Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:38:51.331Z)

comes through his system. So all that granularity can just come through and be in the model without anyone having to, like, key it in. Did Or copy and paste it in.

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:00.843Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:39:02.611Z)

It'll just mean that at some point in time, we have to work with Drew to go, like,

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:05.773Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:39:07.341Z)

drill into the rooms department, drill into the food and beverage department.

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:07.543Z)

And and I think that's part of what, Vinod said last night is

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:39:11.201Z)

Those those are the two biggest, but

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:11.403Z)

you know, all of the data fields that he had. And it's like, so if you've got that information that we will be able to

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:39:14.951Z)

mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:16.833Z)

reel in a in a microsecond, be able to drill into this information and see it without having to go back and forth between the HPIS and our systems and everything we'll have that data imported. One of the things I wanted to tell you about our

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:39:31.981Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:39:32.433Z)

conversation last week, I wanted to have a conversation with you and not over email. Is that I think we I think we tapped into a gold mine. Last week. Something that I wasn't aware of in that you know, with the with the STAR report. I have always been under the assumption because it's CoStar and because I'm familiar with some of the other CoStar reports, that it was basically real time, that I would select the data I want, push a button, and boom on my I've got this information. Awesome. I was told by Mark and Drew that sometimes, you know, you you have to go through, you have to select the properties, submit it, and it could take one to four days you get this information back. I'm like, why? What? That that's that's, like, the most ridiculous. That's, like,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:19.881Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:23.823Z)

That's like

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:24.271Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:25.023Z)

know, 2020 02/2005 technology. And No. No.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:34.081Z)

Well, we haven't moved. Our industry hasn't moved out of that

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:34.653Z)

Yeah. But one what

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:37.971Z)

space. It hasn't moved out of the 1990 mid nineteen nineties. So

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:38.403Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:42.281Z)

yes. And the the there's two clarifications on that is, like, if you're valuing it for an existing asset,

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:47.083Z)

Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:48.731Z)

and the owner or the operator has the star, then it just comes through. Right?

### You (2025-04-28T15:40:50.213Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:40:52.921Z)

It's if you need to get a new comp set for whatever reason, right, it takes you have to submit, and then they have rules because they don't want too much

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:01.933Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:02.831Z)

of one. What they're trying to do is prohibit you from backing

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:04.063Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:07.081Z)

out one individual hotel's information So they've created all these rules around how much of one brand you can have another brand and but but it does take you. It so the what the gold mine is

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:16.663Z)

We're we need the same information for our model

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:19.501Z)

you be thinking that we can do something that in time that gets you that information faster?

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:23.163Z)

that STAR report has. So what I mentioned to Mark and Drew and and and that I think is the gold mine is that when these investors are sending their information to the

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:33.121Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:36.233Z)

STAR report, why not have them send it to us as well? At a fraction of the cost number one.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:44.381Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:44.513Z)

And then what we would do is

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:41:46.861Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:41:48.343Z)

I mean, we would be able to go head to head with with the star report. You know, we would then build up our database and we would be able to let them choose whatever properties they want, push a button, then boom.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:42:00.621Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:42:02.943Z)

You got it. You don't have to wait a day. You don't have to do any of this. You know, with the asset managers who are updating quarterly, you know, we would get that in

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:42:11.651Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:42:12.573Z)

information quarterly and, you know, just essentially, all we'd have to do is, you know, we could we could set it up so that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:42:16.341Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:42:20.123Z)

when you are updating this information to star, then you just go and push this button, and update it to ours. Don't have to make any changes. You know, we could format it the exact same way.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:42:33.531Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:42:35.913Z)

I just think, you know and and and, you know, I told them that one of the the rule of thumb for entrepreneurship and and going after a particular niche market is to find that that industry or that market where there's is one major player who's been there forever, and is behind but doesn't have any competition, either because of their size or because of small market. You know, it's kinda like the David versus Goliath. Be nimble. Be quick. Do something very quickly that they can't do.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:43:10.661Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:43:12.903Z)

They're entrenched into their business model. They're charging thousands of dollars for these reports that really can be generated in an, you know, matter of seconds. It's just a matter of uploading data into the database. I mean,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:43:25.101Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:43:27.503Z)

we could eventually, and I think very quickly,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:43:30.061Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:43:32.483Z)

switch things around to where we are now the primary data provider for the hospitality industry. Because we're getting that exact same data. But our database is built in 2025 We can

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:43:47.261Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-04-28T15:43:50.533Z)

allow them to pick and choose and yeah. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:43:56.301Z)

Where we have the ability to be to be more flexible. Right? We don't have that

### You (2025-04-28T15:43:56.943Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:01.271Z)

all that inherent, like, inefficiency built in. And the one like, one thing as someone who's been in the investment

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:07.543Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:07.551Z)

on the acquisition and the asset management side is

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:09.143Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:10.471Z)

are one or two sources other than

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:11.263Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:13.491Z)

STAR that are actually forward looking. They're not backward looking. They have forecast information. And when you overlay that with the historical information, the forward looking information is, believe it or not, more granular because probably because it's a newer, type

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:26.943Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:29.711Z)

Right? It's called Demand three sixty, and it comes out of a platform called

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:33.353Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:34.111Z)

TravelClip. Which Drew has access to. When you start to do that, then all of a sudden, it just that that adds a whole new dimension to it because now you're

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:40.823Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:43.391Z)

starting to look at a couple months forward, what are all your competitors projecting Right? And it's just like, oh, wow. That that makes a big difference. Right? I can actually see if the market even though this has been a historical pattern,

### You (2025-04-28T15:44:54.513Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:44:56.381Z)

I can see, like, how bumpy or if we're going to, you know, hit some sort of roadblock or something. But, yes, I do. I I think

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:03.063Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:04.211Z)

if, like, to I totally agree with that. I think if you said that to the hotel industry, the beginning, everyone would roll their eyes and let you know what I mean? Like,

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:12.553Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:12.751Z)

but I do believe you that if you what you if the way you

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:15.753Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:16.551Z)

described it, there's a David and Goliath, and there's someone that's been there forever with zero competition.

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:16.753Z)

Yeah. One of the and that's also

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:21.521Z)

Right? So

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:21.973Z)

related to, you know, the conversation that we had is is that, you know,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:22.981Z)

that whole story resonates with me completely.

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:25.733Z)

I mentioned the same thing. It's like they've got this historical information You know, they can go from today back. But the data that we get from our users they're all projecting into the future. They're estimating their their cap rates, their return rates, and their, you know, their PAR and the POR and all these different metrics

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:45:45.541Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:45:49.243Z)

they're forecasting forward to what they believe is going to be happening when they invest in this deal. So we also have that forward looking But much farther out

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:00.291Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:01.573Z)

than the other product that you just mentioned has. You know, if they're getting information for the next six ninety days, that's that's awesome.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:11.181Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:11.563Z)

But then we can tack on three, five, seven years since they and also

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:13.351Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:16.233Z)

say, you know, here's the hot markets. This is where we're seeing a lot of activity.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:20.461Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:21.363Z)

I believe that we could also you know, just take it even even further and and being that one stop shop, you know, these

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:26.281Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:29.763Z)

I know that the industry is used to well, I'll go to Star and get this report. Then I'll go over here and get this report, and then I'll input I'll copy and paste

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:37.271Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:38.773Z)

now, manually do it in Excel. Well, why not come to our platform

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:41.751Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:43.313Z)

You don't have to copy and paste anything. Just putting your data, putting your assumptions, push a button. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:44.471Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:48.283Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:48.401Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:49.173Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:53.191Z)

That's exactly it. Right? That's how that's the cell. And and, you know, I like, I'm sitting here last week and this week,

### You (2025-04-28T15:46:55.883Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:46:59.651Z)

doing exactly what you're saying, and I'm literally grumbling at every keystroke I have to make. Right? Like, gosh. Dang it. I have to, like,

### You (2025-04-28T15:47:04.743Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:47:07.011Z)

sum up quarterly numbers by hand. You know? And it's like, I would rather

### You (2025-04-28T15:47:10.113Z)

And and that's

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:47:11.441Z)

be able to push a button and say, quarter you know, give me the quarter numbers. But

### You (2025-04-28T15:47:11.673Z)

yeah. Yeah, that's the AI play, right? So you've got all this historical data, you've got short term

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:47:15.991Z)

so much opportunity here. So much.

### You (2025-04-28T15:47:18.653Z)

forecasting and long term forecasting, and AI can go and ingest all of that data. And come up with the suggestions. You know, it's like one of those things where you can input your initial assumptions and then click the little AI button. Say, I need to have this rate of return, you this blah blah blah, put in what you have to have for your hurdles. Say, how can I do that? And AI can then go through and and that way, you know, your your inputting realistic assumptions. You know? Because I know the games people

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:47:50.551Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:47:52.653Z)

play when they yeah. It's like, yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:47:56.061Z)

Mhmm. So do I. Right? I mean, we could teach AI the games people

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:01.653Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:03.591Z)

play. Like, first go in and try to manipulate ADR in 25¢ increments

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:04.263Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:08.291Z)

up and down right until this level. And then if and then once we max that out, you know,

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:09.873Z)

Whether you can actually operate it for that

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:12.931Z)

it's like, okay. Where's the next most valuable thing I that will create

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:13.973Z)

know, maybe probably not. But, you know, at least I can make the numbers work out

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:16.641Z)

you know, like, truly, that's the thing. Yes. But

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:18.433Z)

so that I can get my commission. You know? It's like, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:22.071Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:24.403Z)

The other thing that I wanted to ask, and and this is just more about

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:26.641Z)

Yeah. That's what it that's what it is. That's totally what it is. So

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:28.463Z)

planting a seed, but what about international? You know, because I know all of these major brands, they've got hotels around the world. Is that something that we would we would yeah. K. Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:48:45.001Z)

Yes. Totally. That's yes. It's it could be definitely in our road map. And I think what's different about the hospitality industry is just that, that between the Marriott, the Hyatt, the Hilton, the Choice, the IH brands. Right? And there are a few international brands that

### You (2025-04-28T15:48:54.143Z)

Right. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:00.531Z)

in The US, but they're more on the luxury side that even though they're not, you know, there's been this bifurcation in the hospitality industry between at first, it was between operations and real estate, and then it's gone one further, and now it's franchise, just the the brand, the operations, and the real estate. But regardless, I mean,

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:21.643Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:22.431Z)

having Marriott and Hilton like, that is a road map, right,

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:22.963Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:26.591Z)

to international markets, clearly.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:27.203Z)

Alright. Alright. So good. I know we're I we're running over time, but thank you. This

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:29.611Z)

And I do believe that we have the ability to monetize internationally.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:33.053Z)

is a a really good conversation.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:34.441Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:35.363Z)

One other thing I'm gonna do, I wanna send you a a document that I put together, and I did it for my own use.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:39.111Z)

No. Perfect.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:42.153Z)

Not to step on your toes, but I do have a very comprehensive business plan. It's

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:48.141Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:48.693Z)

it's it's all AI generated. I've I have a tool that I've used in the past

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:51.791Z)

Oh, yes. That would be wonderful.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:53.213Z)

and it's basically just to kinda give me a starting point.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:49:56.261Z)

No. Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:49:56.283Z)

So ignore some of the the the revenue and, you know, it it it it doesn't make up the numbers. It's it it has a mass of its I mean, just the appendix with the links alone is a page and a half on this thing.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:50:06.821Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-04-28T15:50:11.743Z)

Of all the different websites that it goes out to get this information.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:50:15.501Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:50:16.853Z)

So it's it's it's probably it's probably fairly accurate, but

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:50:22.931Z)

I love it. You're not stepping on my toes at all. That's great.

### You (2025-04-28T15:50:23.723Z)

I'm more interested is it has an entire section on risks, but, you know, marketing plans, all these different sections that really it gets really deep into the weeds. I think it's, like, 56 pages. It's it's pretty pretty decent sized document, but again, I put it together more for road map

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:50:45.181Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:50:45.863Z)

and and planning purposes than for financing and and and and and all of that other stuff, but it does have a section on all of that information.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:50:51.911Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-04-28T15:50:56.363Z)

But I thought, you know, whatever you're working on, if you wanna kinda compare it and see, you know, is there anything missing? You know, do you wanna add some

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:03.211Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:04.173Z)

like that? So I'll email that to you. You can get a look at it.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:11.471Z)

Okay. And, Howard, if you just if you have some time and you're just sitting around and you're and you're like, while while we're in a slow spot between one person or another person, the one thing I would really like to research as well and and I realize I get laughed at a little bit when I say this, but could we, through our data that we're going to collect, create

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:29.633Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. We could. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:33.601Z)

a large language model, very specific

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:33.933Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:36.621Z)

to the hotel investment space. So

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:38.883Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:39.771Z)

right, And and what would that mean for the hotel investment space

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:40.923Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:44.161Z)

and the our ability to utilize AI? Right? And and our customers may wanna do it with their own data internally,

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:52.013Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:53.171Z)

if we were to do it with all the industries, and this is the hotel investment,

### You (2025-04-28T15:51:55.113Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:51:57.621Z)

which might be a little bit different than the hotel operations. Right? And you totally get that distinction. Right? But

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:02.503Z)

Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:04.301Z)

you know, our clients may wanna do that internally with their own data.

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:06.123Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:08.281Z)

But if we're doing it for the industry, then we might be able to help them do it for themselves

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:10.873Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:12.291Z)

to make comparisons right. And it could be a way to just add

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:13.173Z)

Yeah. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:16.571Z)

a layer of, desire and monetization to our platform. So, kind of using the AI tools that you've been using, just fiddle around

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:23.703Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm a very, very visual

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:24.951Z)

that and see if, you know, if you have time, what it would look like and how it might road map

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:28.373Z)

person, so I've been working on some

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:29.351Z)

out into a business plan.

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:30.353Z)

using a whiteboard to

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:31.461Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:32.833Z)

put in some workflows, and that's one of the things we can take a look at. I've started off at a very high level, and now I'm getting down into the persona So Howard, a broker, an investor, an asset manager, uses Yeah. Yeah. And a lender that I was actually, there's a couple things in this document that I generated that came from Aon. Like,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:52.231Z)

A lender,

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:53.673Z)

oh yeah, I forgot about the lenders. So it's like,

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:52:54.151Z)

Right.

### You (2025-04-28T15:52:58.553Z)

yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:02.121Z)

No. Totally. Because there's so much refinancing going on that to approach a debt shop and say,

### You (2025-04-28T15:53:06.173Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:09.931Z)

we you have to underwrite so quickly. Right? We could speed up your underwriting by

### You (2025-04-28T15:53:12.923Z)

Is it?

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:14.571Z)

you know, 50%. And then if you're willing, we could

### You (2025-04-28T15:53:15.483Z)

Right? Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:19.211Z)

do the loan monitoring for you. Right? The the information could come through Drew and, right, directly from the operators. And and I I swear to god, this exact same thing happened this week. So my part time job, we have our first mortgage with, Peachtree Group. And the, loan monitoring person Peachtree Group reached out to me about a week and a half ago and said, hey.

### You (2025-04-28T15:53:43.423Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:44.081Z)

I never got January, p and l in store. Can you send that to me? And I've been running on the road like crazy. Right? So I just couldn't find the time to sit down and go onto our network

### You (2025-04-28T15:53:51.993Z)

Mhmm. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-04-28T15:53:54.371Z)

and find it and send it to her. So I just did it this morning. But a real world example. Like, she could have just had that. Right? Because and then she wouldn't have chased me down, and I wouldn't have to spend my time sending it to her.

### You (2025-04-28T15:54:05.753Z)

Yep.
