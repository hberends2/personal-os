### Guest (2025-05-19T17:30:42.457Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I almost don't

### You (2025-05-19T17:30:43.579Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I don't feel like going back.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:30:45.687Z)

like going back. I never feel like going back. It's like, oh.

### You (2025-05-19T17:30:47.449Z)

I never feel like doing that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't blame you for that. Yeah. That's that's gotta suck.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:30:52.457Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:30:54.029Z)

Yeah. So I did mention something to Diane last week Mhmm. About

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:30:59.757Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:31:01.009Z)

because she was asking what alternatives when I was looking around at the, legal entity options,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:31:09.577Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:31:10.279Z)

would we have for helping you out I don't know what is required from an employer to be able to sponsor. But I did mention that you and I had also talked about the possibility of you locating to Canada, but I didn't know the details. So I suggested that we discuss that in this afternoon's meeting or we can set up a separate call with Diane if you don't wanna bring it up in front of everybody. But I I still wasn't quite clear on on either of those. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, probably, I'm just worried you are. I just

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:31:46.277Z)

Yeah. I mean, probably, I'm just where you are. I just

### You (2025-05-19T17:31:50.739Z)

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:31:50.857Z)

didn't get

### You (2025-05-19T17:31:51.559Z)

chance to look into that at all. The only best option

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:31:51.877Z)

chance to look into that at all. The only best option

### You (2025-05-19T17:31:55.109Z)

is to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:31:55.207Z)

And I am talking to somebody tomorrow. He's not an attorney, but

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:00.377Z)

I am talking to somebody tomorrow. He's not an attorney, but they help with all this stuff.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:06.159Z)

they have with all this stuff. And he's, like, giving me some consultation for free.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:08.157Z)

He's, like, giving me some consultation for free.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:12.119Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:12.257Z)

So

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:12.799Z)

let's see if something will come out.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:12.997Z)

let's see if something will come out.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:15.659Z)

But I know people

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:15.807Z)

I know people

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:16.949Z)

kind of

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:17.117Z)

kind of

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:18.449Z)

do

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:18.597Z)

do

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:19.759Z)

this type of thing. And I

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:20.097Z)

type of things and I

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:21.929Z)

have known that people have done that. I don't know personally, but I have heard that people

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:22.097Z)

have known that people have done that. I don't know personally, but I have heard that people

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:26.069Z)

do that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:26.207Z)

do that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:27.039Z)

So one is, you know, something will come out

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:28.087Z)

So one is, you know, something will come out from that consultation.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:30.059Z)

consultation. If not, I have to pay $200.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:31.377Z)

If not, I have to pay $200 to an attorney and then sit with him for an hour.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:33.259Z)

To an attorney and then sit with him for another option. Okay. And that's the next option.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:35.847Z)

That's the next option. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:37.299Z)

Yeah. I would imagine for a company to sponsor you that there's probably there's gotta be some type of legal or not legal, but there's gotta be some type of guideline out there that I

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:48.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:52.039Z)

can find. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:32:52.557Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:32:53.079Z)

you know, otherwise because I'm sure you have to have paper filed. My my question is, you know, like, do you have to have to be in business for a certain period of time? Because I I can see playing devil's advocate here that, you know, you wouldn't want somebody to set up a business

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:10.797Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:11.719Z)

to sponsor but not really have a business, right, to do it solely for the

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:15.957Z)

Yeah. That's what

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:16.439Z)

response. Yeah. That's what it is. So I know that I option is

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:18.167Z)

The other option is, like, we do it

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:19.629Z)

like, it will on my wife's name.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:21.117Z)

my wife's name.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:22.159Z)

That's the last option, I would say.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:22.347Z)

That's last option I would say.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:24.129Z)

Because she she has that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:24.207Z)

Because she she has that

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:26.919Z)

legal

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:27.177Z)

legal

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:28.219Z)

labor. She's an h four e a t. K. So she can do anything. She can open her own business and work running where

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:28.997Z)

an 4. So she can do anything. She can open her own business, can work for an employer,

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:35.629Z)

all that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:35.867Z)

all that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:37.099Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:37.377Z)

So that would be the last result.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:37.709Z)

So that would be the last result.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:41.997Z)

So

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:42.459Z)

So Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:43.197Z)

I'm sure, I mean, it's it's workable for sure.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:44.549Z)

I'm telling you, I mean, it's what people prefer. Just that it's people are not very

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:47.237Z)

Just that if people are not very finicky about

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:49.399Z)

finicky about these rules.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:51.007Z)

these rules. That's all. Some people are I don't know. I just don't do anything.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:52.289Z)

Yeah. Some people are are not just don't do anything. But people do everything on agenda feature.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:33:55.687Z)

But people do everything on I think the visa.

### You (2025-05-19T17:33:58.339Z)

Yeah. I mean, I I you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:00.857Z)

Mean, I I you know,

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:01.939Z)

I understand there's

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:02.197Z)

I understand there's this law, there are rules, and you have to follow.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:03.269Z)

there's law that rules any of the follow. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:05.637Z)

But

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:06.369Z)

you don't have to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:06.557Z)

you don't have to follow it too strictly.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:07.399Z)

follow it strictly. Even though it does not like that. He's he's going in Pakistan.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:08.957Z)

Even Donald Trump is not doing that. He's he's going in park

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:12.329Z)

So he already had to open businesses for his family.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:12.367Z)

Saudi Arabia to open businesses for his family.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:15.569Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:16.367Z)

So

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:17.569Z)

Alright. Well, we'll we'll figure it out.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:19.887Z)

yeah, we'll figure out. I'm sure we'll

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:20.649Z)

Yeah. We'll figure out. I'm sure we'll figure that part out. And, I mean, that's the last thing in your mind.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:23.087Z)

that part out. And, I mean, that's the last thing in my mind. I I'm just like,

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:25.619Z)

Think, like Yeah. To

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:27.227Z)

too deep

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:28.029Z)

think. Into what we think of, like, yeah, I want to get this

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:28.777Z)

work. I'm like, yeah. I wanna get this to a stage where

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:31.239Z)

to a state. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:32.337Z)

we can show it to people.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:33.599Z)

Yeah. Well, I hear you.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:35.827Z)

And how that works out will

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:36.519Z)

And how that works out, you know, probably have something, but

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:38.327Z)

we'll probably have something, but

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:39.839Z)

we'll

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:40.067Z)

we'll we'll we'll figure that out. Yep.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:45.719Z)

Well, I have been trying

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:48.117Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:48.539Z)

Yeah. To work on getting some of these pages built.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:34:53.977Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:34:57.389Z)

Or or at least getting the formulas built, and it's a little bit tougher than I thought it would be.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:35:05.437Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:35:06.169Z)

Yeah. It's just an awful lot of details. So I'm I'm really trying to dig down and get into the weeds and see if if do we really need to get at that particular level of detail, or is there no other alternative? Like, that food and beverage is what I'm working on right now. The room revenue is easy. That's just, you know, how many rooms do you have, what is your expected occupancy, what you're average rate, Multiply them, you're done. But food and beverage, I'm looking at that tab right now.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:35:41.947Z)

No.

### You (2025-05-19T17:35:41.999Z)

There are a ton of hidden rows that I just discovered. And they kinda roll up And, also, there are some macros in that page, which being on Apple, I can't access. So I may have to go and switch into my other laptop. But, think we can simplify this. We have to be able to simplify I think for at least the MVP

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:06.767Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:07.129Z)

we don't get down into the detail. They they've got two different calculations on One that you can just make a broad assumption, the other one where you can really get into the weeds. For the different types of services. I I just don't think we've got the time to get down into the weeds and the we can get it good enough for the POC and the MVP. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:29.057Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:30.969Z)

We'll go from there. But my my concern then also is and I think I mentioned last week that we we can't just go through 14 pages of modals to put in assumptions that you're gonna have to work on them as a group. So I'm just trying to decide, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:45.867Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:49.189Z)

layout and design. You know, I wanna

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:50.027Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:51.969Z)

come up with a couple of ideas, and then you and I can sit down and try to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:53.337Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:55.709Z)

hammer out Yeah. Where you think it's best.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:36:57.417Z)

Yeah. I I didn't make

### You (2025-05-19T17:36:58.709Z)

I I admit a little progress on that front, so I was trying to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:00.967Z)

little progress on that front. So I was trying to

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:03.749Z)

submit these forms to database IDs.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:04.087Z)

submit these forms to the database. Right? These tabs go

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:06.569Z)

That's good. Alright. And these phones are

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:08.757Z)

And these forms are what you had in the previous

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:10.059Z)

what you had in previous version. It is not even the updated version.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:11.777Z)

It is not even the updated version.

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:13.609Z)

K. And then I'll try to pull that metrics on the top and all that. K.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:13.987Z)

And then I was trying to show that metrics on the top and all that. So the way I thought

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:18.929Z)

So the way I thought is

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:21.357Z)

is

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:21.549Z)

the first property details. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:21.847Z)

the first property details. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:23.959Z)

I currently use a few stack.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:24.277Z)

As far as the user feels that,

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:27.619Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:27.837Z)

And

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:28.299Z)

so we have all the data coming in.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:28.757Z)

we have the data coming in from

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:30.609Z)

From some API or tool system. We

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:31.377Z)

some API or draw system. We create the deal at that point.

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:33.869Z)

create the data like that. Point. Just on the fastest screen itself. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:36.317Z)

Just on the fastest screen itself. And then we

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:38.989Z)

And then we to tell you, sir, that, you know, the date

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:40.457Z)

tell user that, you know, the deals has been created. Now next step is

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:41.879Z)

has been created on suspect. Is really

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:44.827Z)

filling these as mentioned details.

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:45.389Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Because even though they wanna have the attention details,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:48.447Z)

Even though they don't have these assumption details,

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:50.969Z)

we can still

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:51.307Z)

can still

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:51.979Z)

show them that it started on data. There are, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:52.377Z)

show them their historical data, their, you know, charts or other

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:55.119Z)

charts or other reports and all that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:56.567Z)

and all that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:57.289Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:37:57.637Z)

Only the model part would not be shown.

### You (2025-05-19T17:37:57.779Z)

Only the model part would not be shown. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:01.097Z)

The model part even the model part, you know, certain financial and all

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:01.249Z)

The model part even the model part, you know, certain, you know, can't allow that will be there. But whatever is based on

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:04.867Z)

that will be there. But whatever is based on

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:06.919Z)

these adoptions could not be created right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:07.257Z)

assumptions. Not be created. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:09.439Z)

I think that'd be neat, though. I think that'd be very helpful them. You know, if we upload the documents, and then they can see the historical trends, you know, where it is today, give them a starting point, I think that would be

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:18.837Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:20.539Z)

think that's a good way to go.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:20.937Z)

Yeah. That's how I built the navigation right now.

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:21.729Z)

Yeah. That's how I have been through that because I was like, no. I'm in

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:26.207Z)

I don't think the app is running there's some matter of

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:27.419Z)

the app is running. I think it's some better. Okay. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:30.857Z)

thrown up, but that's how it is gonna come up with maybe I'll

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:31.939Z)

that's what it is.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:35.527Z)

try like, I do both. I don't know whether you can see

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:38.249Z)

But then in the office world, it's blurry.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:38.647Z)

But this is my office work. It's blurry. And then this laptop, I'm

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:40.719Z)

And then this laptop, we have to currently done.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:42.627Z)

currently talking. That's, like,

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:43.189Z)

That's like

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:44.667Z)

so I work on both back to back, like,

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:44.789Z)

so I back to back, like, this is not what we're working here. So whatever I'm not able like, work here.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:47.477Z)

laptop is working here. So whenever, you know, I do little work here and then switch back here. And then I'm sitting throughout throughout the night. But that's when I'm working from home. When I go to office,

### You (2025-05-19T17:38:57.889Z)

Office, I'll

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:38:58.607Z)

I really hate it.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:00.539Z)

because

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:00.887Z)

Because

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:01.089Z)

my main

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:01.497Z)

my main productive hours

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:02.109Z)

product device are going into something that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:03.587Z)

are going into something that

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:04.789Z)

too. Kind of temporarily working on

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:05.617Z)

I'm temporarily working on.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:06.949Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:07.347Z)

And that's why I was

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:08.429Z)

And that's why I was hoping that we had some sort

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:10.617Z)

hoping that we had some sort of

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:12.249Z)

finding what now

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:12.617Z)

funding worked out

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:13.889Z)

and then we have to really

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:14.287Z)

And then, yeah, we could knock knock this thing out real quick.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:15.219Z)

help. You know, this thing out real quick. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:18.937Z)

But, I mean, yeah, when I go to office, then

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:19.529Z)

But, again, when I understand it, it's like it come

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:22.257Z)

like, yeah, come home and after dinner.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:25.099Z)

into whatever.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:26.207Z)

Do whatever can because then you have to go to office next day.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:29.089Z)

Yeah. So those

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:29.397Z)

So those three days when I go to office, Tuesdays, Wednesday, and Thursday, those are kind of

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:33.809Z)

We have been productive.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:33.867Z)

not very productive from invest

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:35.229Z)

From interest perspective,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:37.387Z)

perspective.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:37.979Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:38.417Z)

But, yeah, working from home, and then we can

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:41.879Z)

We can actually pass right now.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:42.907Z)

fully packed right now. I just want to

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:44.199Z)

I just want move this

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:45.567Z)

move this

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:46.369Z)

to a level where, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:46.757Z)

to a level where, you know, this kind of complete completion of MVP

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:48.039Z)

this kind of complete complete some of where we'd be

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:51.227Z)

I I'm gonna pause. Then, you know, we have the funding and the things, and then, you know, we

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:56.029Z)

covered.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:39:56.427Z)

resume the work.

### You (2025-05-19T17:39:57.059Z)

Yeah. I don't know what we can do I mean, it I I agree. Know, if we can get an POC set up for that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:06.167Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:06.329Z)

meeting with CBRE, see how that goes. And, yeah, I do not wanna start working into anything more detailed until we can start getting user feedback.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:18.137Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:20.799Z)

And So we gotta get somebody in there helping us test come up with some other ideas. I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:26.277Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:28.699Z)

I'm not saying that what Mark and Diane and Drew are asking for are

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:31.247Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:33.169Z)

Yeah. Are blind, but, you know, everybody's got their own opinion. And I you know, just think some of that stuff is gonna come out in that that we probably don't have to do certain things or we can

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:45.917Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:46.909Z)

lay it out differently. And I don't wanna start

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:48.617Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:49.759Z)

going back and forth and back and forth. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:53.577Z)

That's true. We should only build the functionality first, which is sellable or which

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:57.459Z)

which is

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:58.217Z)

get us funding.

### You (2025-05-19T17:40:58.829Z)

Yeah. That's all.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:40:59.217Z)

That's all. What we want to focus on. That can be anything, either asset management or

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:03.239Z)

Aware.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:04.077Z)

side.

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:04.479Z)

That's why I'm really kind of focusing on getting that summary operating cash flow, cash flow summary tabs. The first three are in

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:14.277Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:15.759Z)

blue on that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:16.127Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:16.799Z)

worksheet. But in order to get there, I have to have some of the penetration. I have to have some of the assumptions. We have to have the food and bev and the other op. Correct. Because that's the source of the data for those tabs.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:26.087Z)

Alright. Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:29.119Z)

So Okay. It so that's what I'm doing now. I'm focusing today. I wanna get the food and beverage. And and a the minimal amount of detail that we need to make it functional.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:42.357Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:42.749Z)

And go back. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:44.737Z)

Yeah. Yep. That's that's

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:46.159Z)

Yeah. That's that's the way to go.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:41:48.337Z)

the way to go. Let's see. I was planning to give you demo real quick, but I don't think this thing is running right now. But anyways, so I'm in in this week where I could

### You (2025-05-19T17:41:58.149Z)

Right. So I'm In this week, what I would be able to do is I corrected the thing

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:01.397Z)

able to do is I corrected the team based on our logo

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:03.779Z)

based on one. So then you

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:06.367Z)

that it looks like our

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:06.539Z)

try it out. I have no

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:07.787Z)

app now. I was able to create the account management system.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:09.539Z)

to create the account. And that form and

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:12.467Z)

And then that form and then editable version of that form.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:13.799Z)

I will take a portion of that form. Like, the details getting, like, added to that.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:15.977Z)

Like, the deal is created. Now you wanna add it to that add page with all the tabs.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:18.599Z)

Page with all the tabs. And then that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:21.527Z)

And then then metrics on the top. I don't remember exactly which metrics he sent, but

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:22.379Z)

prefunded account, which But I have

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:26.227Z)

I have cash on cash. I have average daily rate.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:28.769Z)

I have restricted

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:30.647Z)

I have cap rate.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:31.579Z)

and I want more.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:32.087Z)

And I have one more.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:32.769Z)

ROI ROI should be one.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:33.257Z)

Four on the top. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:36.199Z)

The return on investment. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:38.887Z)

R r o r r e r or something like that. That's there.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:40.409Z)

Or something like that. That's there. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:43.477Z)

So four are there and hopefully in next

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:45.109Z)

Sephora. Yeah. Sephora.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:47.817Z)

three, four hours, I'll have this thing sorted out and then I can probably demo.

### You (2025-05-19T17:42:51.649Z)

Okay. Cool.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:42:54.527Z)

Yeah. But, yeah, next major milestone is putting that all in the model.

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:02.319Z)

Right? That's

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:02.777Z)

Right? That's

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:03.649Z)

what the

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:04.087Z)

what the

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:04.449Z)

focus would be at you. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:04.907Z)

forecast would be, I believe. So assumption gets submitted to the database, and then we have this

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:08.199Z)

send get some of that data the day or day, and then we have this

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:11.897Z)

model where

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:12.139Z)

model. Web. So what the

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:13.847Z)

so what the model, right, they're gonna download. What else they're gonna do? Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:19.979Z)

I don't know. Right. You mean download it into Excel? Or

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:25.827Z)

Yeah. Alan,

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:27.929Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:32.177Z)

download index. Right? So they already hit

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:33.999Z)

They already fill it that in

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:35.437Z)

fill in their exemption. We have the historicals, and then we compile

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:37.119Z)

of and then we

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:39.277Z)

all that into the model. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:39.779Z)

that into the model. Right? Yeah. Or

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:41.887Z)

Or

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:44.159Z)

we also want to create

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:44.637Z)

we also want to create more pages

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:47.099Z)

pages. Which are simpler to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:49.077Z)

which are similar to model. We already have performance metrics. We have the other things.

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:53.399Z)

things.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:55.277Z)

As far as the application goes. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:55.879Z)

As far as the application goes. Right? Yeah. So, yes.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:43:57.917Z)

Oh, yes. Oh, I have something here. Let me share.

### You (2025-05-19T17:43:58.329Z)

I'll add something here. Let me share. Yeah. So I I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:02.247Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:02.379Z)

the best way to think about this is Yeah. We want to put together the Red IQ version for hospitality with a fully functioning first pass. Right? So if first pass worked the way it should,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:19.667Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:20.859Z)

Rede IQ users would not need Excel. They could do all of their work in the application, get all of their metrics and everything else, but first pass never worked the way it should.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:31.507Z)

Right. But

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:32.779Z)

So But the assumption that we are creating is on them first password

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:35.277Z)

the the assumption that we are creating isn't that fast pass version?

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:38.389Z)

What's that?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:38.857Z)

The assumption form that we are creating. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:39.699Z)

The ejection form that we are creating. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:43.067Z)

Isn't that similar to first pass because user is inputting their data

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:43.499Z)

Isn't that similar to fast pass the user is inputting their data through the assumptions, and then we have financial data from

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:47.497Z)

these assumptions, and then we have financial data from

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:50.209Z)

through

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:44:50.717Z)

true.

### You (2025-05-19T17:44:50.859Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So so what the users are putting in the model for what we're building are what they would typically do in their Excel model. Right? So since first pass, wasn't it doesn't work.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:09.997Z)

But

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:10.779Z)

Our users would upload the historical data and then go into Excel

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:15.027Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:15.089Z)

to do their evaluations. Right? So if we have if we have our version of FirstPass,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:21.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:21.889Z)

which is what I'm working on now,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:23.327Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:24.809Z)

We don't need them to go into Excel. And so I hope to get to a basic version

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:29.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:30.579Z)

of where we can input the data. You can create the you know, historical charts. But then just stay within Invest AI. Input their assumptions, some of the things I'm working on right now for the food and beverage.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:47.747Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:48.399Z)

And do everything within our tool. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:52.337Z)

Yeah. And that food and beverage is also part of the assumptions. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:52.609Z)

And the code and the is also part of the evolutions. Right? Yeah. Cool. Cool. Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:58.067Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-05-19T17:45:59.069Z)

Cool. So yeah. Okay. Let me show you that this right at all.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:45:59.467Z)

Okay. So here okay. Let me show you if this runs at all. So once the user logs in, right, so this is like

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:03.709Z)

So you. So much. Bye. This is, portfolio that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:07.077Z)

portfolio dashboard. Right? We had post portfolio dashboard. So

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:08.799Z)

we have. Portfolio dashboard. So know, how it

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:11.717Z)

you know, how many properties you have in total, what are the average returns of that. I

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:12.099Z)

property do you have in total? What are the applications of that? I have to be used right now.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:15.757Z)

deals right now is zero. What is the total investment? This is recent deal. This this is completely

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:19.629Z)

This is the same thing. This this is completely

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:23.417Z)

even few of the data here. This is I'm just

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:23.439Z)

fill the data yet. This is I'm just keeping it

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:26.147Z)

keeping it so so that, you know, it feels like

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:26.559Z)

so so then I feel like yeah, I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:28.617Z)

yeah, I think

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:29.299Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We can fill it with

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:29.837Z)

we can fill it with better data.

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:31.299Z)

better data. Yeah. And then we have this market

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:33.777Z)

And then we have this market performance here.

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:35.399Z)

performance here. I mean, I still need to look in

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:37.857Z)

Mean, I still need to look in

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:39.549Z)

look more into it.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:39.627Z)

look more into it. This is giving some

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:40.859Z)

Is giving some basic.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:42.287Z)

basic metrics here.

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:42.419Z)

Metrics here. Would this be coming from Drew's data?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:45.417Z)

Yeah. This is all from Bruce data for now.

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:46.379Z)

Or Yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:49.597Z)

And then

And then

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:51.657Z)

you have the portfolio breakdown

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:51.919Z)

before breakdown when you can break by time with the full service this.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:53.857Z)

you know, you can break by tie with the full service this.

### You (2025-05-19T17:46:57.529Z)

Break by time.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:46:57.997Z)

Break by brand, region,

### You (2025-05-19T17:47:00.159Z)

So, basically, there's some in there.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:00.737Z)

So basically, some filtration there.

### You (2025-05-19T17:47:02.749Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:03.257Z)

Yeah. So that is the

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:09.277Z)

So that is the first page when the user logs in.

### You (2025-05-19T17:47:10.239Z)

first page when it was a logs in. Right. And then we

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:14.017Z)

And then we go here, it is runs

And it's like, yeah, I'm

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:53.857Z)

And we yeah. I mean, whatever

### You (2025-05-19T17:47:56.129Z)

call you think about, let me know, and then we can think

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:56.937Z)

you think about, let me know and then we can think.

### You (2025-05-19T17:47:58.949Z)

you know, add the moments are not popping up or something. Yeah. So when I

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:47:59.397Z)

Know, add them rooms are not popping up for some reason here. So when I do add it, let's see.

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:03.139Z)

do add it, let's see.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:04.937Z)

This edit is working.

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:07.059Z)

Few things are working. You are not

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:07.547Z)

Things are working. Few are not. And let's go to the other flow. From that. Something like

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:30.439Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:31.077Z)

okay.

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:41.019Z)

I think all the accounts.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:41.587Z)

Working. Yeah. Anyway,

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:44.589Z)

Probably

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:45.117Z)

probably I'll have it in better state by the time.

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:45.599Z)

in better. State. Bye. The time. But then

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:49.007Z)

But then on the deal

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:49.309Z)

on the ticket what did you think it means?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:51.117Z)

what deal details basis. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:52.449Z)

To subscribed.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:53.907Z)

We'll probably

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:55.649Z)

Have that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:56.257Z)

have that

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:56.939Z)

more

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:57.757Z)

model thing.

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:58.449Z)

thing. Download.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:48:59.547Z)

Download the model or

### You (2025-05-19T17:48:59.909Z)

The model or alright.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:02.847Z)

right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:03.059Z)

Yep. I mean, what

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:03.867Z)

I mean, what the

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:06.629Z)

so

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:07.457Z)

so if

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:07.859Z)

if we don't

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:08.447Z)

we don't want to give the download model functionality, right,

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:08.589Z)

get the download model functionality, right,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:12.877Z)

I mean, if they download, they can just play around in Excel, but

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:12.999Z)

Okay. They don't, they can just play around in that. So for

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:17.207Z)

it's just for their their use.

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:17.279Z)

Yeah. Doing there. This is this is one thing that I definitely wanna hold off until we talk to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:24.447Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:24.689Z)

clients. It's like are they going to insist on continuing to use their model?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:32.497Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:33.959Z)

Or are they willing to switch to this if we can persuade them that you can do everything in our tool faster and more accurate. So we need to get a we, meaning, you know, myself and Diane, we can work on marketing materials that will emphasize the the benefit of a a web app versus Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:49:57.507Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:49:58.749Z)

But you know, one thing is, like, talked about last week is just you know, maybe having a data dump from if they really wanna get the data into Excel, maybe we just x the data in a tabular format, CSV or whatever, and they can copy and paste.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:11.937Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:16.009Z)

At least for now. That might be the minimum that we'd wanna do. So I really, really

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:22.517Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:24.219Z)

do not want to have anything that's like valuation IQ or quick sync.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:27.267Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:29.189Z)

I really want my goal is to get a % of the

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:32.877Z)

I'm thinking about

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:34.779Z)

valuation activity done within our tool.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:37.687Z)

Got it. Got it. So let let's think about this flow. Okay?

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:37.689Z)

Got it. Got it. So think about this flow. Okay? Yeah. So you will just create

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:42.607Z)

So user creates the deal. User puts all the assumptions.

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:43.669Z)

the deal. You just put all the assumptions. We have their

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:46.877Z)

We have their portfolio page. We have the

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:47.439Z)

portfolio being that they have paid paid.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:49.897Z)

deal page. We have the deal detail page. We have deal list page.

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:52.609Z)

Yeah. Now

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:53.487Z)

Now when we when it comes to the model that we have,

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:55.379Z)

the port that have,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:50:57.767Z)

that Excel model,

### You (2025-05-19T17:50:59.139Z)

How is that gonna be consumed?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:51:00.027Z)

How is that gonna be consumed within the application? We'll create the pages for the entire

### You (2025-05-19T17:51:06.639Z)

Entire model within that case itself? Yeah. Yeah. That that's what I'm working on now.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:51:07.567Z)

model in the application itself.

### You (2025-05-19T17:51:12.199Z)

So you know, the the model that I showed you before so you'll have the categories. Right? So you'll have the property details, food and beverage, whatever. Then when you click on it, it expands and has the details down there. What I'm leaning toward is, you know, like I said, you can't go through and do every input modal.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:51:35.377Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:51:37.219Z)

At one time. You have to go to those pages. So maybe I'm thinking is, you click on the food and beverage page. Or category, it can expand

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:51:46.717Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:51:48.499Z)

but then also you know, we have to think about well, I then I would like to open up the food and beverage section. Right? So the screen opens up. And you're you still have the left nav there, but now you're in the food and beverage category. And so of those subcategories, then that's where you're gonna have inputs. And what I'm afraid of is there's so many inputs, like, on the food and beverage that you're either gonna have a

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:52:14.077Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:52:15.959Z)

pretty long vertical scrolling or we can break it up into categories and and you know, so they can click on you know, the the restaurant or the bar or whatever the categories are in there.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:52:27.567Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T17:52:31.399Z)

And input the data there. And while they're inputting it at the top of the screen will be like a roll up. Of everything. Right? So you've got your metrics up there, then I would like to see know, the next steps that we're gonna do on the yearly under that. So they can input their, like, their growth assumptions and everything else. Whether no matter what category they're in, they can see the the total at the top. But I'm not sure if that's the best way of doing it, so I'm gonna start working in I'm gonna put together a whiteboard and try to mock up what it would look like, and I'm gonna put together use Lovable or something to put together a working page.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:14.137Z)

Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. That makes sense.

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:18.089Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:20.307Z)

And as we are talking, I'm still thinking would it be easier for the user to kind of write

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:25.199Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:26.407Z)

their assumptions somewhere in the Excel or Word or anywhere and we just ask them to upload their assumptions. And then

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:30.129Z)

Them to we just expect to report

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:33.747Z)

we just extract and put it in.

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:34.289Z)

again.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:37.297Z)

And once we have that

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:37.479Z)

That was do we have complete. Then.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:40.717Z)

then, you know, everything runs on the application.

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:41.059Z)

You know. Think that's on the application. If if it's Yep. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:45.047Z)

If it is easier for them, I don't know.

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:45.769Z)

No. I I don't know if it would be because when you input assumptions, you wanna see what that happens. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:54.047Z)

Oh, okay. Oh, Howard, is it?

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:55.779Z)

just inputting numbers on a on a

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:53:57.537Z)

Perfect.

### You (2025-05-19T17:53:58.939Z)

on a spreadsheet that we upload wouldn't help them. And they would effectively then just

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:02.197Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:05.099Z)

be doing all their work in Excel and then upload it. So yeah. So that

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:07.927Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:09.499Z)

I I like what you're saying about a template. Now we could do that for historical information.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:09.937Z)

Right. Makes sense. Makes sense.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:14.289Z)

Or something like that or an upload. Yeah. But but for for working in our model for forecasting, every time you change a number, it's gonna change what that property's worth.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:25.187Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:27.869Z)

It's gonna change something in the revenue or expenses. And Right.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:30.067Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:32.639Z)

Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:34.677Z)

And then eventually, we'll have to make some sort of tool

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:35.989Z)

to make some sort of

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:38.357Z)

AI tool which can auto fill all these fields.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:40.319Z)

all these queries. Yeah. And then we update this

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:42.877Z)

And then, you know, they just

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:43.899Z)

You write your data, say, okay. This is right. This is wrong. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:44.917Z)

evaluate. They just say, okay. This is right. This is wrong.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:47.279Z)

Yeah. I I what I yeah. It's I think exactly you know, when we were talking to what was his name? David earlier? Whatever his name. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:54:55.217Z)

David. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:54:56.639Z)

That's what I was thinking as well is that if we have access to other data sources or with whatever Drew has,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:04.757Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:06.029Z)

You know, what we wanna do is we wanna take that historical trend

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:07.257Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:09.809Z)

You know? And the last thing you wanna do is okay. So if I'm at this level,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:15.267Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:16.829Z)

whatever this is, at the time that I buy the property, I can't assume a sudden increase or decrease on the day I take it over. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:24.947Z)

Yeah. Exactly.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:26.379Z)

You can't have a starting point here.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:28.317Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:28.549Z)

And then you can trend it out. You know, is it gonna go up, or am I gonna reduce expenses? And by, you know, by using the historical,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:35.597Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:37.349Z)

You know, we could be you know, basically trending. Use use the trending to go forward.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:55:44.737Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:55:44.849Z)

Yeah. And that might work for somebody who's just go who just wants to buy a hotel and continue running it. But if I'm gonna buy a hotel and make major changes to it, then I would go and change the assumptions. But, yeah, I mean, to your point, if we could

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:56:04.077Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:56:04.179Z)

prepopulate that, that would take up, you know, 70 or 80% of the the the users' time

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:56:13.037Z)

Yeah. We'll find out how populate and then they just confirm it.

### You (2025-05-19T17:56:18.029Z)

Yeah. Exactly.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:56:19.137Z)

Like, you know, this modified whatever required.

### You (2025-05-19T17:56:20.889Z)

Yep. Okay. And that kinda goes into where I wanna I would like to have

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:56:24.227Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T17:56:26.869Z)

pre

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:56:26.957Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:56:27.409Z)

preset assumptions So, you know, they may have 10 other properties in a particular area in which case they can share labor. Right? So their labor their labor cost per property will be less than if they only have one property and they have to hire staff and up there. So in a situation like that, they would wanna adjust it. Like, okay. Well, yeah, but I'm going to my labor costs are only gonna be x percent as compared to the other y percent. And if they came in there and they put in preset assumptions, say, okay. In this market, this is my labor expense. They won't have to do anything. Whether we pre populate that, we would say, okay. For this line item, we wanna use this and not really necessarily extrapolate and and and trans or project forward

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:28.977Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:57:29.559Z)

Lot of ways we can get it. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:36.087Z)

Yep. Yep. And then as far as underwriting and evaluation goes, for portal, particularly. That is completion of it. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:57:51.199Z)

have different methods. We'll have different reports template.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:51.887Z)

Have different metrics. We'll have different reports generated. We'll have different dashboards.

### You (2025-05-19T17:57:54.219Z)

We'll have different dashboards and all that. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:56.857Z)

And all that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:57:57.749Z)

But this is

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:58.497Z)

But

### You (2025-05-19T17:57:58.899Z)

all of it. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:57:59.667Z)

this is the core of it. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:01.249Z)

Yeah. It is From

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:02.647Z)

It is. From underwriting evaluation

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:04.779Z)

there's nothing we have. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:06.257Z)

perspective, there's nothing left. Right?

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:06.879Z)

Right. Right. And then

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:08.267Z)

And then

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:09.409Z)

you know, yeah, parties I guess in my

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:11.067Z)

mhmm. The other part is, like I said, man management and all that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:12.439Z)

my name is Granola. Yeah. Yeah. So one lesson that I've learned with a lot of the organizations I've worked for is they try to build for a particular need at a particular point in time, and they don't take into other things. So, you know, I'm trying to make sure that we are

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:34.897Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:35.589Z)

future proofing we're doing as well, and we don't end up with the, you know, the bubble gum and barb and and and wire. What do you call it? Bubble gum and wire or whatever. You know? Hacking things together. And things crash.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:54.617Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:58:55.299Z)

Oh, I can tell you stories on that one from the utility management side. Boy, that was a disaster.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:58:56.837Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:00.269Z)

But Yeah. But, yeah, I think that's

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:00.657Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:03.009Z)

that's what we can do. If we can get this core functionality, in just historical documents,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:11.487Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:11.709Z)

populate our data, project forward with both internal and external data,

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:17.117Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:18.769Z)

And then let the user just say, go through and tweak. I mean, you could get to where you could I mean, literally, you could

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:21.417Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:25.079Z)

put out a a model in an hour. Know, by the time they go out there and do that is compared to how many weeks?

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:29.537Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:32.309Z)

So that's that that would be the ideal situation. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:38.297Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:38.979Z)

Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:44.797Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:46.139Z)

And I did see

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:47.367Z)

And I did see your new version of the

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:48.859Z)

of the form, so I think I don't have to

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:51.077Z)

so I think I'll have to

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:51.309Z)

access whatever else to do that for time.

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:52.847Z)

adjust whatever I was doing as per that.

### You (2025-05-19T17:59:55.009Z)

I need a lot of

### Guest (2025-05-19T17:59:55.767Z)

For the attention part.

### You (2025-05-19T18:00:01.139Z)

Food and beverage and other operating departments. So other operating, I think, is gonna be

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:00:06.347Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T18:00:08.629Z)

similar to food and beverage, but not as detailed because food and beverage, they have it broken out by breakfast, lunch, dinner.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:00:15.727Z)

filing and all, I think we'll hold back

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:14.359Z)

That's what Diane was asking about. So I think we really need

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:15.607Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:19.119Z)

try to keep that conversation going in today's call. Yeah. Because

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:25.227Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:26.339Z)

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:30.867Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:32.149Z)

You know? We gotta get some type of financing. Like, I, you know, I just

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:33.457Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:37.549Z)

bothers me that you know, we can't even go and get Jira. Right now. Because we can't you know, can't keep putting anything on Diane's credit card.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:45.287Z)

Yeah. Yeah. This is

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:48.409Z)

You know, we already everybody volunteered to reimburse her for the

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:49.557Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:52.359Z)

email. So that's why I figured, okay. Well, linear is free.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:03:57.297Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:03:57.389Z)

For up to five users. Who knows? Maybe we'll like linear enough to go with it.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:04.717Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:05.009Z)

I just cannot get my hands around confluence I just and we have Microsoft Teams, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:12.107Z)

Okay. What?

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:15.299Z)

Teams has everything that Confluence has, you know, maybe to Yeah. Format.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:16.997Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:19.129Z)

So I can do without Confluence. That's for sure. So Yeah. But

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:25.027Z)

Yeah. Yeah. But now, right, unless we have a big team and all that, so we'll

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:26.709Z)

team and all that. So it probably

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:30.537Z)

probably we don't need a lot of that. See,

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:30.639Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So I think

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:34.407Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:34.769Z)

think we're I think we'll be okay

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:37.337Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:37.399Z)

You know? Don't even know if we need linear. I mean, if it's just you and I, I mean, I mean, we do need I think it's a good idea. There is a Jira.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:46.587Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:04:47.869Z)

Integration linear linear. I don't know if it's two way or if it's just to migrate from Jira to linear. I I know. But there's a ton of integrations with them.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:04:58.927Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:05:00.579Z)

Zapier and a bunch of different things that knows? Maybe you just Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:05:04.587Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:05:06.969Z)

For for most time deciding whatever comes for it, we will just use it. Alright? You know?

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:05:08.267Z)

Yeah. For tools like this, I think whatever comes free, we'll just use it. Otherwise, we don't need anything. We'll just use documents for now and all that.

### You (2025-05-19T18:05:13.249Z)

Yeah. I mean, who who knows? Two, three months from now, if we deposit a million dollar check and we've got funds to do all this, then we can review it, re then. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:05:22.657Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:05:26.729Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:05:28.587Z)

### You (2025-05-19T18:06:47.259Z)

It's completed.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:06:49.967Z)

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:07.567Z)

checking the

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:08.869Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:11.637Z)

So probably let's talk about that

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:12.389Z)

So Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:15.107Z)

in the meeting too because I don't know whether Diane wanted that model. If she doesn't want it,

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:17.329Z)

K. You're talking about the Excel model? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:22.917Z)

Yeah. It's a model.

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:23.939Z)

That's I I don't know where she got that. I think she got that from somebody else anyway. One thing is I I do like the model that Mark sent out was was good. I kinda wish we had that to start off with.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:39.827Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:40.269Z)

But I noticed it's I don't think it really differs from this. It I think the layout differs.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:07:47.307Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-19T18:07:48.439Z)

But that is you know what? I didn't even think about that till just now. I might take a look at the food and beverage on that one. Maybe it does have a simpler process. But it does have the STR, the star report. Tabs. That's what we put right there. So that'll give us I mean, that's that's what I'm drooling over. I mean, that's where we're gonna make some that's where the money's gonna come in if we can replace star reports.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:08:13.017Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-19T18:08:14.929Z)

That'll be worth a ton of review. So

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:08:17.857Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Our that that will be used, though. We need

### You (2025-05-19T18:08:21.599Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:08:22.857Z)

### You (2025-05-19T18:08:24.819Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-19T18:08:27.397Z)

I mean, his star data, like, we get the data from SDR and we which here we are. SDR too.

### You (2025-05-19T18:08:34.119Z)

We wanna buy your data so that we can put you out of business. Alright. Well, cool. Anything else?
