# Transcript for: Carrie and Howard Berends - InnVestAI

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:27.995Z)

Hey, how are you?

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:46:29.514Z)

Can you hear me?

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:30.155Z)

Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:46:32.874Z)

Yeah. Oh, my God. So good to hear from you.

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:35.515Z)

Yeah, likewise. It's been a while.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:46:39.114Z)

Yeah. So how are things?

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:42.075Z)

What's that?

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:46:43.834Z)

How are things with you?

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:45.595Z)

Things are interesting. So, yeah, it's been a crazy, crazy year.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:46:49.194Z)

Yeah. Catch me up. I want to hear everything.

### You (2025-08-22T17:46:55.915Z)

Well, let me just keep it simple. So, yeah, back at the end of January, Radix practically shut down Red iq. Made some really bad decisions after they bought Red iq. They were in the midst of. Having some real issues with their main product. And so they basically pulled all of the engineers off of Red IQ to help with their product. And red IQ really did not do anything from new product standpoint. I mean, we were all excited because Radix has all of that data that we never had, and we had actually talked to them about partnering with our data, and we thought when they bought Red IQ, it was going to open up a lot of new opportunities. But they just made some bad decisions. And essentially at the end of the end of January, they let everybody from redIQ go, except for two junior engineers to basically keep the lights on.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:48:22.474Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T17:48:23.435Z)

JPP and his team except for one or let go and Ben Coleman and I think Tenzing. Were kept on, and they're primarily selling Radix products. So red IQ is still there. It still exists. But they haven't done anything other than they did have one very smart data scientist. That was starting to use AI to process rent rolls. And I think they made some progress on that. But that's about it.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:49:11.594Z)

Oh, my gosh. That's so shocking.

### You (2025-08-22T17:49:12.155Z)

Yeah. I knew.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:49:19.114Z)

Was the leadership team expecting this to happen? Because no.

### You (2025-08-22T17:49:22.315Z)

No. Nobody had a.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:49:25.674Z)

Turn for 360.

### You (2025-08-22T17:49:29.435Z)

Sudden it was a Friday, and all of a sudden, one at a time. Red iq. People were getting notification. They had a quick phone call with HR and they were gone. So I think when jpp was let go. I think that's kind of when everybody realized that this is pretty serious, and so I had no idea what they were doing.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:49:54.154Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T17:50:00.075Z)

When I first heard that. I know. JPP and Radix's vice president of client services didn't seem to be getting along all that well. So when I heard that he left, I. You know, it didn't really dawn on me that, you know, that myself or anybody else on our team were in danger. I just figured they were rearranging. But then I started hearing about more and more people. Then I don't remember. If you remember, Vinod.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:50:31.354Z)

Yeah. So, ben, the gym.

### You (2025-08-22T17:50:36.475Z)

Was one of the lead developers. I think he worked primarily with Stephen on the reset.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:50:44.874Z)

I don't think I've met her.

### You (2025-08-22T17:50:45.995Z)

Yeah, probably not. I don't think it would have been any calls that you would have been involved in. But anyway, when he got let go, then I realized that, yeah. They're shutting things down. And so I just kind of sat back and waited for my phone call. Yeah, got it. That's kind of what happened with red I.Q. yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:51:05.594Z)

So you want to start your own thing? Now.

### You (2025-08-22T17:51:12.395Z)

I, of course, started to send out resumes, but it's a brutal job market. I only got one response. Out of all the resumes I sent out. Had one interview scheduled, and 30 minutes before the interview, they reached out and said, we already offered the position to somebody else. Thanks anyway. So yeah. I was for quite a while wondering. What's going to happen. But at the same time. I don't know if you were involved in the conversations. But two years ago, and I think it was at the time that you may have just started, but I was having some conversations with the Berkadia Hotel group. There was a consultant named Diane Fox. That was working with the Brcadi Hotel team. She has been in the industry forever, knows everybody. And she thought that red IQ would be a perfect fit for the hotel space because she says, well, there's nobody out there like it. And so we were talking. But it became clear that Berkadia had no interest in. Using red IQ in the hotel group. That's when they started scaling back. So every once in a while she would ping me on LinkedIn and asking if there was any possibility that we could keep working with Berkadia And then after Radix bought us. I talked to Blairum, the CEO, and he had no interest whatsoever on anything outside of multifamily. That's all that Radix did. So next time shipping. That's like, sorry, not gonna be able to help you out. We are not doing anything. Outside of multifamily. For some reason, it was just pure coincidence. She did not hear anything through the grapevine. She didn't know. But, like, two weeks after that Red IQ got shut down, she reached out again, and I'm like, we should probably talk about this. So that's how we got started. So we are an official startup now. So there's Diane, myself. And then there's three other. People that are considered the co founders. And one of them is name is Mark, Mark Gordon. He was also, in fact, he was national head of sales for Cushman and Wakefield's hospitality group. And then he branched off and started his own company. And then he started a hotel development company in New York City. So he has also been around the industry for four hour. And has all sorts of knowledge. On hotel development. Hotel brokerage. And then the other guy is Drew, who has been involved in hotel asset management. And he has zone startup that's geared towards asset management, reporting and things like that. And he is a partner, and we're actually going to kind of merge his company into hours, so we now have access to his data. He'll have access to our clients. We'll keep going on building there and then Vinode, that was with me@red IQ, now here as he's basically engineering it and we have three. Offshore engineers. That are currently building it out. So I built a proof of concept using no code tools.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:55:35.674Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T17:55:42.955Z)

And now they're taking that proof of concept and making it an actual workable. Valuation model. So it's basically the red IQ for hotels. But what really amazed me is that when I first met Diane and she thought, yeah, there's nothing like this in the industry. I'm like, yeah. There's got to be something out there. Every real estate asset group has some type of evaluation model or something out there. So when she reached out to me, Right after the layoff. I started researching, and sure enough, there isn't anything like this. In hotels. Everybody is still using Excel. There's property management systems and there are other asset management type systems. But there is nothing out there for valuation.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:56:38.474Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T17:56:39.675Z)

So we are targeting, obviously, brokers and investors. Consultants. But then we're also going after appraisers, lenders and servicers, which is something that we had a lot of interest in, that Berkadia That they wanted to get their loan servicing team and the lending team to have something like redIQ for their valuations. So we have an incredible open opportunity. We're going to stick to hotels and hospitality, but we're going to go deep. We're going to hit every single one of those Personas. We have a lot of data. We've actually talked to other partner data providers and they're very interested. So it's the exact opposite of what we had at Run iq, where nobody wanted to share data or we couldn't because of the contract with Berkadia We've had multiple conversations with. Some industry experts as well as potential investors in every single one of them has been extremely positive. We haven't had pushback from any of them yet. And they're all like, yeah, we need this. Do we need this bad? So, long story short, that's my full time job now. Even though there's no income. There's no revenue. But I've always been a very conservative and guarded. Person. I would never say that. This is a guaranteed thing. But this is close to a guaranteed startup that I could think of. So that's where we are. So you catch me up where you are.

### Guest (2025-08-22T17:58:38.874Z)

Yeah. I mean, so after Red iq, I started doing a freelance gig. Like, I always want to learn about growth marketing. And I had a friend that was looking for just freelancing to do US acquisition, and I just hopped on and I just got converted like six months ago. So now I'm just doing growth marketing at inkit. And about inkit is think of a little mini Netflix. It's a startup as well. So there's three products. There's Ink it, there's Dalatea, and then There's Kenny Jar TV. So InKid is the free product. Where anyone think of it like TikTok, but for story writers or like authors where anyone can go on the platform and they can just write books. And there's like, anyone can read it. And once it does well, we will publish your story into Galatea. And then that's when you are in royalties and get paid out for your stories. And if that does well, we produce your story into a movie. Or show, and it's like a short form content as well. So you can kind of be a mini star, like anyone can write on our platform. Even me and you. We can write about property management or asset management on the platform and gain an audience in that form. But, yeah, that's kind of like what I've been doing. I don't know if I've ever told you this, but you really gave me my first shot in marketing, and I don't think I've ever thanked you enough. And I'm just super grateful being able to kick start right after graduating as well. It feels like full circle to be talking to you again because I'm still very interested in real estate, so I was very excited to speak with you.

### You (2025-08-22T18:00:55.755Z)

Good. Good. Yeah. You know how our entire team felt about the work you were doing. We were so disappointed that we couldn't just continue bringing you on. But, yeah, I'm glad. I mean, you were obviously the first person I thought of, because we are just now getting to the point where. We have to come up with some marketing. Marketing materials. The node and the team will have our mvp. Ready. Probably mid September. Early September. We were hoping to get it out right after Labor Day, but I think that's a little too aggressive. And so the only people who have seen my proof of concept are the people within our team, just the five of us and a couple of the developers. I showed them what we're doing. And then on a couple of the calls, we gave them a quick overview and showed them what we had in mind. The proof of concept that I put together, part of it works, and part of it is just static data that shows what it's going to look like, right? So the first thing is, because Diane, Mark and Drew are so well connected, We don't expect to bring on an actual sales team. Until we get to what we're going to call version one. So the MVP. Is basically going to be an invite only. Beta test. Cbre. The biggest commercial real estate. Company out there has already committed to giving us some business analysts. To help test it. I mean, if we just sign them and there are only customer. Right. Because at that point, when you've got the biggest commercial real estate. Group out there. You don't even have to sell it. You just say, look, this is what CPR is using. Here, sign here, send us a check. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:03:24.074Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T18:03:24.715Z)

So we're not going to go with a real sales team, but we do need marketing materials, and that's. Mark. Mark has been a broker. But he's always had a team, so Mark can't really personally put together. Any of these things. You know, he's. He's working with Diane on a pitch deck to go to the investors, but it's not a marketing deck. Or anything that we would send out. So the idea is they would go to some of the industry conventions and conferences. We would need something that we could probably, whether it be a handout or something there. We're probably going to need, like, a PowerPoint deck or a presentation of where they can sit down and actually give them. Obviously, they're going to have to do the sales, but they're going to be selling to people they know personally. So that's really kind of what we're looking for help with. So, given what you're doing right now, I don't know if you've got the bandwidth to take on anything extra over and above what you're doing now. So is your relationship. Are you like a full time employee of Ink it or are you like an agency or a contract?

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:04:51.994Z)

Yeah. I'm a full time employee at Ingot, but what are you guys looking to do? Because I am open to helping part time if that's something that are you guys just looking for to me to be more involved with the team on a day to day basis.

### You (2025-08-22T18:05:12.635Z)

Yes, but not yet.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:05:15.274Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-22T18:05:17.115Z)

Here's the funny thing. We don't exist yet. We are still working on forming the llc. And so Diane was supposed to get that set up and ready to go. For final review next week. Right, so we've got the website, we've got the name, we've got all this stuff, but we don't officially exist. So we don't even have a bank account right now. Everybody on the team is working for free. Except for Mark and Drew, have contributed some of their own money so that we can pay the offshore developers. Mark, Drew and Vinod have full time jobs outside of this, but Node was able to get a job. Remember Shoma Samya? From Berkadia one of the engineers. He probably would have been on calls with us about the deal accelerator and a couple other things. Anyway. Berkadia has laid off a lot of people. Aglaya's gone. There's quite a few people who have left. But Shoma had a job and he recruited Vinod to come over. So Diane and I are really the only ones who don't have any employment at all. The capability of paying yet. So hopefully in a couple of weeks, we do have, in fact, we have one official investor who's going to write us a check for $50,000 next week and another one behind that that has informally committed to 100 grand. So we'll have money. In a couple of weeks, we'll have the bank account so we can actually pay people and do things. So I think what we would want is probably just some hourly consulting or project based consulting at the very beginning just to help us get some of that. Marketing material. Ready to go. Consultation and recommendations on website. Everything else. We do have a lady that we've been speaking with, kind of a friend of a friend of Diane's, but she has. I forget. Four or five prop tech startups that she's sold. I mean, she's a, she's a pro at starting. Businesses. And she will probably be on our board. So she can give advice. On. What do we need to do to start up the company? But I don't think she would be the marketer, right? But I think she would be able to tell us, here's what you need to do first, here's what you need to do next. And so we would need somebody who could be that growth marketer role. But then again, we would have to have some revenue coming in in order to actually make somebody an employee, right? We're not at the point, other than the offshore team, who are technically contract employees, so we're not taking out taxes or anything like that, because we don't. We can't. We don't have a company.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:08:59.994Z)

Yeah, that makes sense.

### You (2025-08-22T18:09:02.235Z)

I can't really get into specifics because this is the first phone call. I brought it up in a meeting. Right before I pinged you on LinkedIn. It's like, hey, I know somebody who would be very helpful in this. So even internally, we haven't really nailed down exactly what we need because we got five people running the company who has never started a company, right? Blind leading the blind. Other than we've got a couple, we've got one other board member.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:09:30.474Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T18:09:34.635Z)

Who now? He's the one that's writing the 50,000 check. Is an attorney, a patent attorney, and is guiding us through the startup and everything. So we've got that type of. Consultants or advisors. But we HAVE n't sat down and put down on the paper exactly what we're looking for. So that's why I'm being very wide open and vague. But it sounds like what you were doing before with growth, marketing and everything else when you were working on your own is that's what we need.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:10:06.954Z)

Yeah, I mean, I think definitely help on weekends or so to stealth mode, so to speak. Still. And I'm happy to help. Hourly is great until some funds come in. Or also open to equity partnership, if that provides more flexibility. Flexibility? For now, I'm open to it. So very passionate about real estate. So we love to be able to help in any way I can. And if marketing is what you guys need, I can definitely do that. I can provide Craig, PowerPoint, Dex. I'm going to do handouts. I'm very savvy in that sense as well.

### You (2025-08-22T18:10:47.835Z)

Yeah, I know you are. Yeah, Well, I appreciate your flexibility because even though I haven't done my own startup, I know and have worked with others. And it's a pretty well known fact that typically the first employees, the salary is low, but the equity is part of the deal. It wouldn't just be an hourly or even just a straight salary. So I'm glad that that's an option. So let me.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:11:23.274Z)

Yeah, you can chat about it with your partner.

### You (2025-08-22T18:11:25.675Z)

Chat with Diane. Actually, I want Diane to talk to you. I don't want to. Make sure she's involved. I don't think Drew or Mark would really even want to be involved. They'll probably just say yeah. Go take care of it. So let me get with Diane, and I'll try to coordinate a call. And then send out a few options to see when you're available. And I'd like to have her talk to you next week, if that's okay.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:11:56.234Z)

Yeah, I think next week would be great. Next week is Labor Day weekend, so more grieving.

### You (2025-08-22T18:12:01.755Z)

Yeah. We can't wait until it's ready to go to start making these. We got to get everything ready in advance. So, yeah, I think you've got my InnVestAI email from the calendar invite. So if you want to check out the website investai. Com and you can start kind of taking a look at it. Nothing is official. Even the logo is just something that Vinod came up with when he was putting together the website. I mean, everybody thought, oh, that's nice, but it's not official. So we need basically from the ground up, Work on our marketing. And things like that.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:12:52.554Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-22T18:12:53.435Z)

Let me go ahead and get with Diane and give her the rundown of our conversation, and we will set something up for next week. Are there any days or times that you're absolutely not available?

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:13:05.914Z)

Sounds good. I need to double check, but what is the number?

### You (2025-08-22T18:13:13.435Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:13:17.994Z)

Sorry. What's the name of their real estate company called InnVestAI Is that.

### You (2025-08-22T18:13:23.195Z)

2 ends AI com.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:13:31.754Z)

Okay, I'll check it out. So.

### You (2025-08-22T18:13:33.275Z)

The name InnVestAI is very catchy with the two ends. Right. Hotel. They're not going to change. Yeah, not going to change the name, but the logo is up for grabs.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:13:37.674Z)

Yeah. Oh. Wow. Okay, okay. What about. Is the company opening to testing? With us. Like where they provide the business like business analysts.

### You (2025-08-22T18:13:59.995Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So that's one of the things that we absolutely have to do. And I, I kind of, I feel. That I've had a number of phone calls where I have to kind of temper expectations with. With these guys. I mean, none of them have a software background at all. Even the asset manager, who's now into reports. And that that. He's got his own company. But he's struggling to get clients and he has no software background. He's using Power bi. He's just getting data, building Power BI reports and sending it out. So Vanot and I kind of have to educate them. As we go along. And how do we build this? They're thinking that we can do all sorts of things with AI the very day we go insight. No, it's not like that. So we're dealing with some very non technical people there and so testing. If it comes down to just vinodenai, that'll take forever. We just don't have the bandwidth to do something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:15:18.074Z)

Also I meant to say earlier you mentioned there is a pilot real estate company that wanted to support and test this with us. Like you said, they would provide some business analysts to test the software. What was the name of that potential first client again? Is it see.

### You (2025-08-22T18:15:36.955Z)

Cbre.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:15:40.074Z)

Very gotcha.

### You (2025-08-22T18:15:41.755Z)

And they're just one. There are others that have said that they want to. Help out, but they're friends, small groups. But cbre did.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:15:53.354Z)

Are they also business analysts as well, those friends or.

### You (2025-08-22T18:15:56.315Z)

Yeah. Essentially, what we're going to do is just have them continue to use their Excel models, but then also put the data in our tool to make sure we come up with the same numbers. So just. It's more of. A fact checking. Testing. Because if you're using the same numbers, the formulas are the same throughout the industry. You got to come up with the same nut, data, right? So that's really what they're going to be helping with. Right now it's basically myself and Vinod working on the ux. I didn't know, but Vinod actually did to have a design background. So it's not like he's just an engineer. Just an engineer? Putting together a website or anything else. He is pretty good at it. So we've been doing pretty good so far, I think, but.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:17:00.314Z)

Are they full stack engineers or are they. Oh, kindness.

### You (2025-08-22T18:17:02.075Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:17:04.954Z)

Can you remind me Diane's background again? Is she. Also in comes from commercial real estate or.

### You (2025-08-22T18:17:11.995Z)

Yeah. Let me just send you a link to her profile. LinkedIn. I can go ahead and send that. That's. That's really about the only information I have. But, yeah, she. She's actually done one of these types of people who have done everything. In real estate. She was a broker. Worked at financial institutions. Independent consultant, asset management. I mean, she's very familiar with every facet of it. So that's where her value comes in, is she's got all these different areas that she's experienced in. Whereas Mark is a broker. Drew is asset manager, right? So I think, yeah, I'll send you her link and you can kind of take a look at that and get familiar with it prior to our next call. I'll do the same thing for her. I'll send her yours, and then we can.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:18:12.154Z)

You guys all face in the same time zone or the sound?

### You (2025-08-22T18:18:15.755Z)

No. Well, pretty much. Drew is in Inglewood, California, so he's west coast. The rest of us are East Coast. And of course, we've got the Offshore team as well. But it's not somebody you would have to be dealing with. The engineering team.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:18:35.194Z)

Okay? Sounds good. All right, well, I look forward to your speaking with Diane when she's available, but next week.

### You (2025-08-22T18:18:45.035Z)

All right. Well, reach out anytime you've got a question.

### Guest (2025-08-22T18:18:50.554Z)

Sounds good.

### You (2025-08-22T18:18:51.035Z)

Anything I can do to help out, I will certainly do that, but. Yeah. Keep an eye out. Like I said, if. You don't have to tell me right now, but if you want to shoot me an email, If there are times next week that you cannot meet, just let me know. And we'll set something up. Based on diane.

So if next week doesn't work and you want to wait till the week after, not a problem.
