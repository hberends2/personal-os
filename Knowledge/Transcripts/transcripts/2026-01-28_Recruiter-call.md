### Guest (2026-01-28T15:13:57.984Z)

They're also important. Hello.

### You (2026-01-28T15:14:06.707Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:14:08.464Z)

Morning, Howard. You can switch your camera off if you like. It's just a normal phone call. So, completely up to you.

### You (2026-01-28T15:14:11.747Z)

Okay? That's fine.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:14:15.104Z)

Perfect. Well, apologies for the bit of connection, the connection loss. But I'm glad that we can get on the phone now. Do appreciate you taking time to speak. Yeah. As you know from my message on LinkedIn, I am currently working on a product management role and it is in the commercial real estate space, specifically location intelligence. And geospatial data reached out to yourself as I see that your experience does lie within that sort of industry. So of course today just kind of want to understand your experience a bit better and how you could potentially be a good fit for the position. From the end of our conversation, more than happy to give you some detail. So what the company is what they do. See if it's something that you yourself would be interested in putting yourself forward for and to see if you'd be the right fit for as well. So, yeah, perfect. Howard, first things first is I reached out to you, but you still did get back to me. Just interested to know you actually looking for new roles or new positions, or you just kind of interested to see what's going on.

### You (2026-01-28T15:15:17.507Z)

No, I'm definitely looking for some new roles. I have been doing some consulting. I've got a couple of projects that I'm working on right now, but I'm always open to.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:15:34.624Z)

Perfect. Brilliant. Yeah. So just going on to your experience then, Howard, I see it from your resume. Thank you for sending that across. That you have had 15 years plus experience in commercial real estate. So interested to know where that kind of started. You can walk me through from the beginning. Just walk me through your career history within commercial real estate.

### You (2026-01-28T15:16:00.387Z)

I've actually been working real estate my entire career.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:16:03.744Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:16:04.707Z)

And started off in real estate operations and asset management.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:16:07.104Z)

Everybody.

### You (2026-01-28T15:16:11.187Z)

Was president of asset management and vh management services. Intelligence. With bell partners. For some of. The multifamily owners and operators. And. Around.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:16:33.984Z)

Experience with that.

### You (2026-01-28T15:16:35.107Z)

2007 is when I. Was working in Dallas. And real pages based there, and I had some connections. And files. Kind of a strong technical acumen. I was asked if I would like to join Real Page to help them. Create their first warehouse. And basically central reporting, which was. Data. If you're familiar with, and I'm sure you are, Business models growth through acquisition. So they do not build any of their own products from scratch. They always buy a company incorporated into their products. Each company actually after acquisition, is still pretty much an independent pnl. So they were all siloed. For. Data and central reporting product, but that's where I got Bitten by the TechBook. Side. And have been working in prop. Tech ever. Since.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:18:02.704Z)

Brilliant. Perfect. So, yeah, you mentioned that you've always had a bit of a strong. Is it technical background. So were you quite hands on with this developmental kind of overseeing the product roadmaps that have walked me through that a bit more.

### You (2026-01-28T15:18:16.867Z)

We have a very source. This is real page and it's actually one of the subject matter expert where I was working directly with the product team. But I don't code. I'm not going to call any punches.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:18:30.144Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2026-01-28T15:18:33.747Z)

But at that particular time, I had never worked as a product manager.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:18:34.144Z)

Around. 140.

### You (2026-01-28T15:18:39.747Z)

But essentially I was doing the job of a product manager by being the subject manager, expert. But I had other people on the team, product owners and other people who would help with the technical side.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:18:54.704Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:18:55.427Z)

But since then, yes, it's been. A product. Purely product management roles.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:19:04.944Z)

Perfect. Yeah. So I am working on two different positions. One's on the data platform side and one's on the platform services. So I have both of those roles posted up on my LinkedIn. I'm not too sure if you've had a brief look at them at all, but I mean, through your own experience. I believe that perhaps a platform services role could be a better fit, as the data services side is a bit more obviously technical. Right. They want someone who's got a bit more of an engineering background. Continue on with your career and your history. I'm interested to know how you being in CRE has developed so forth to where you are now.

### You (2026-01-28T15:19:49.587Z)

Can you repeat the question? I'm not quite sure I understand what you're asking for.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:19:54.784Z)

Just walk me through your other experience within commercial real estate are the positions that you've been in after RealPage.

### You (2026-01-28T15:20:04.067Z)

Okay? All right. Yeah. Well, actually real page. It was an interesting situation. So back when I actually made the transition into product management, I started off with a company called aum, American Utility Management. When I was afterwards, I was very heavily involved with ancillary revenue. And utility management.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:20:39.184Z)

Then you might be strong benefit.

### You (2026-01-28T15:20:42.947Z)

On the side. Again. I had some contacts. When I left, Bill Pardon was asked if I would be willing to join a UN to receive their business intelligent and. On the riverside. And I worked for them for about four years. Remote at the time. But they brought in Doo, who was not comfortable with remote employees until I was asked to relocate to.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:21:21.344Z)

That's very small.

### You (2026-01-28T15:21:21.347Z)

Chicago. Unfortunately, that wasn't an option. So I left Aum and then joined National Water and Power, which is a direct competitor. Of a UN, but was one of the companies I did business with as a client. And I joined nwp on february 1st and on february 10th they were required by realpage.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:21:50.544Z)

Oh, wow. Full circle moment.

### You (2026-01-28T15:21:55.107Z)

And that's something very common, because a year later, they bought a un.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:21:57.904Z)

Yeah. Sure.

### You (2026-01-28T15:22:03.907Z)

In one way or another. It seems like I've always worked for Real Page. And then they bought two more platforms, utility billing platforms after that. So my primary role with Real Page then was the senior product manager for inverse classes, bill pay and business intelligence. So I've always held my fingers in the analytics side. Primarily also then because the do work silos, but these were actually. Purchased real page to more or less increase their customer base and also to acquire specific.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:22:41.584Z)

The miracle.

### You (2026-01-28T15:22:49.587Z)

Strengths that each of these platforms had. So my job, also on the BI side, was to consolidate all of that data coming from four different billers. Into a single platform, so worked a lot there with integrating those platforms. And then, of course, the pandemic comes around, which was also the same time that Toma Bravo was doing their due diligence. On page. For an acquisition. And so they had stayoffs at a real page.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:23:29.424Z)

I hope.

### You (2026-01-28T15:23:30.227Z)

At the same time the pandemic hit, trying to get that balance sheet to look as good as possible for the acquisition.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:23:39.264Z)

I.

### You (2026-01-28T15:23:40.147Z)

So at that time, I was one of the many hundreds that were downsized in a real page. And then a year later, I joined Conservus. Actually, no. Page Utility Management. Biggest competitor. This is the largest in the industry.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:23:57.024Z)

Need. That.

### You (2026-01-28T15:24:01.347Z)

But when I joined that, it was a step backward.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:24:04.144Z)

Account.

### You (2026-01-28T15:24:08.707Z)

Just a. But it was just a role. And step back and pay, step backward in pretty much everything.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:24:14.544Z)

As I mentioned earlier.

### You (2026-01-28T15:24:19.267Z)

And so about six months later, I was recruited by rediq. Which is a multifamily commercial real estate valuation. Model. Real estate investors.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:24:36.464Z)

Directives.

### You (2026-01-28T15:24:37.427Z)

That turned out to be very. Brought together my education doing finance and economics. As an asset manager and control state. One of my roles was acquisitions and valuation, and so I had a series underwriting and working in that area.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:25:04.864Z)

Is that sort of way.

### You (2026-01-28T15:25:05.507Z)

And the company went on red iqrkadias companies have ever worked with. So it turned out to be really kind of a dream job. But there was no way up there. My title? Senior Director of Product Management. Every sense of the word. I was actually performing the duties of a vice president.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:25:31.984Z)

So much.

### You (2026-01-28T15:25:34.627Z)

Vice president that I reported to Project Management experience.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:25:37.184Z)

Positioning.

### You (2026-01-28T15:25:39.427Z)

She was project manager by background. Did a fantastic job of that.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:25:49.344Z)

Android.

### You (2026-01-28T15:25:49.587Z)

And in every sense of the word, except for the title of my resume, kind of convince we work together. I oversaw the entire product management side and continued as a project manager and also working with the other teams in the organization as well. Basically from that point on, I was basically in charge of the roadmap new products and features. One of the things that I realized as when I first joined rediq was that most of the data and the services providing for the underwriting and evaluation and the acquisition of multi also transition over to the operations. So the first thing I did was I created what we call the asset management suite, which. I encouraged to continue using the Right IQ product even after we acquired the property, so it was a full product. And so expanded into other real estate classes, such as family rentals, student housing. We were looking at a couple other asset classes. August of 2024. The previous multifamily.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:27:25.104Z)

Then.

### You (2026-01-28T15:27:25.107Z)

Data processor aggregator.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:27:35.104Z)

How long?

### You (2026-01-28T15:27:35.987Z)

For iq. Which I think details, but probably not necessary for this call. But the bottom line is that it was a perfect combination at the wrong time because rediq was exceedingly radical. It's caught up in the class action lawsuit against.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:27:58.624Z)

I said.

### You (2026-01-28T15:28:03.907Z)

Because of that, they had to do a complete pivot on their core product. And they took all of the IQ sources except for 1, 2, the Lariq, basically.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:28:17.104Z)

I will transcribe. They won't come. When I speak my clients, I recommend.

### You (2026-01-28T15:28:23.107Z)

They were doing Escaping the Wife and all of the other feature. D basically. The lights on, Keep it running. In january of last year. CEO of radix is from kosovo. And their engineering team for the red extra time. It's what they basically let all of the rediq employees go. They migrate to the coastal team.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:29:02.704Z)

What I want to do is actually.

### You (2026-01-28T15:29:07.267Z)

And I've been back doing consulting. Working with a couple of startups.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:29:12.624Z)

When I do go instead. Okay. All right. Well, brilliant. Thank you, Howard, for giving me that background. Definitely gives me some more insight into your experience. Of course. Interested to know the products that you have been a part of building and going to market with the numbers side of things. I see a few numbers on your resume and how they have generated revenue into the company. But just from your side, could you mention some products that you've been a part of or been a key player in that has positively influenced the company?

### You (2026-01-28T15:29:15.427Z)

Today. Absolutely. Going back to the page, utility management. In fact, the very first role at American Utility Management was they did not have any type of reporting. Consolidated Reporting. So the first create. The. Management dashboard. For the internal external user. S.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:30:17.744Z)

They look like on average.

### You (2026-01-28T15:30:20.707Z)

They had three analysts and it were creating individual Excel based reports for their clients. And they were putting together over 100 reports.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:30:31.984Z)

I don't know. The time is.

### You (2026-01-28T15:30:33.747Z)

So the first thing I did was we analyzed those reports. We were able to down to 20 reports because the vast majority of those reports were the exact same content, but the layout was different based on the client's request.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:30:50.864Z)

The third. No problem.

### You (2026-01-28T15:31:00.467Z)

I could see their real time. Data or their utility usage, their costs and expense. Once we released that sales increase substantially. I don't have those numbers from 15 years. So I would buy a percentage. One amount, right?

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:31:19.584Z)

Of course.

### You (2026-01-28T15:31:22.387Z)

But they did gain a lot of traction, which is one of the reasons why we're a page later acquired. And same thing, utility management. One of the things that they have, the Berends accord and they had sustainability.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:31:48.704Z)

I'd like to.

### You (2026-01-28T15:31:49.987Z)

Some specific requirements have been. Put together with the two earliest ESC sustainability platforms that we put.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:31:57.424Z)

Push off.

### You (2026-01-28T15:32:07.027Z)

We were able to sell other utility management clients. Type of platform. Work in conjunction with the team, agree with other clients that we're looking for that type of reporting. We're able to put it together. And then, of course, at RealIQ,

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:32:29.904Z)

Of the role.

### You (2026-01-28T15:32:30.947Z)

Life cycle management system is when I notice that the product could be used throughout the entire lifecycle. That opened up significant ancillary revenue. Or on the revenue streams that didn't exist before. So we were able to create that and things. That was what we call. The. Future. Which is basically demographics. That includes geostation. That's exactly what this was. I worked with the data science team and we were able to put together a tool that once you would go in the 1 through 5 mile radio, but also. What is the earthquake? What is the fire risk? All these different things. Underwriter would need to know why they're acquiring the properties, what is basic school system and things like that. So it doesn't say that. Sexy, should we say? What the product is, but it was new to that industry and a large number of clients that signed up. That's where some of those revenue features come from. And as I was going to say, very sad. But there's also on the other end, the cost savings, where I have a knack for identifying redundancies and inefficiencies and just as much time.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:34:12.704Z)

Perfect. Go ahead. Absolute. Ly. Seems to be.

### You (2026-01-28T15:34:34.947Z)

The expense side and making expenses. On the revenue side.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:34:44.864Z)

Okay? Yeah. What you were doing at rediq definitely seems like it's quite aligned to the role that I'm currently working on in the sense of geospatial and commercial real estate. So that is definitely a positive. Brilliant. And just going on to your management experience as well. I know that you're a Senior Director Rediq so interested to know how many people were directly reporting to yourself, how many indirect reports, what sort of job functions were they, and who you were reporting to directly to.

### You (2026-01-28T15:35:17.507Z)

So starting with Rediq as a senior director, Within the rediq division, I add three product owners.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:35:28.464Z)

Xic.

### You (2026-01-28T15:35:31.587Z)

Managers that are in the reports. Included both electrons and dancing vice president that I mentioned that we were kind of co workers. Within the Berkadia team itself, we were just one of 11 teams. That. Were part of the Berk team. I did not have any direct responsibility as other teams, but one of the things that I didn't post champion process. It was very comfortable. With heavy. And it worked well for some of the Acadia teams, But not for Rediq is working with all of the 11 teams to create called the Four Horsemen, which is basically product led.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:36:26.624Z)

Benefits.

### You (2026-01-28T15:36:38.707Z)

Product management system there. A lot of collaboration, but no direct. Overseeing of those people. But throughout my career. Team. Asset management side. Of experience in managing team. It spread between both the operations and asset management. As well as product management. Side.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:37:15.344Z)

Okay, Perfect. And were you ever kind of responsible for perhaps engineers and the technical side? I mean, does that come under the umbrella of product owners?

### You (2026-01-28T15:37:23.907Z)

Yes y. Es.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:37:24.464Z)

Okay. Perfect. Brilliant. So.

### You (2026-01-28T15:37:26.387Z)

So if you want to dig deeper into that, then, yeah. With each product owner. Each product owner worked with two to three different engineering teams and channels. Engineering teams had anywhere from eight to 15 members.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:37:33.504Z)

Rry. Okay, brilliant. Perfect. So, Howard, just going on to what a new role would look like to you. As you know that I am working on a VP position. But say this wasn't going to be the right fit. What else would you be looking for in a new role? What sort of job function are we looking for? A senior position? Talk to me.

### You (2026-01-28T15:38:06.707Z)

It would with the amount of experience that I have. First off, it would have to be in prop tech. I really don't have any interest in going into any other industry. It's what I know. It's what I love. I've got deep connections going out there. So client feedback and getting ideas is pretty easy. It would have to. Also, I would prefer to have some element of individual contributor. I'm very creative and I'm very. Good. At. Opportunities. And. I like to get. My hands dirty.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:38:51.424Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:38:53.667Z)

I would definitely. Appreciate some type of Even if it's a VP or SVP level, I would still want to have some type of. I see. Type of role responsibilities as well.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:39:13.904Z)

And would you be open to startups? I know you're consulting with startups right now, but you yourself working for one.

### You (2026-01-28T15:39:21.427Z)

I'm sorry. Can. You repeat.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:39:25.344Z)

Would you be open to working for a startup? I said, I know that you're consulting for startups, but would you in particular be open to working for one?

### You (2026-01-28T15:39:33.267Z)

Oh, absolutely.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:39:36.304Z)

Brilliant. And I know that you mentioned you need it to be a remote position, so would you be open to perhaps a hybrid role if it was near to where you're located?

### You (2026-01-28T15:39:48.227Z)

Not likely you're going to find a hybrid. Yeah. If there is something here. I would turn it down. But that would be the needle in the haystack.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:39:59.744Z)

Okay, understood. And relocation is an option for you. Is it? Brilliant. Okay, well, I was just going on to salary and your expectations as well, if you don't mind sharing what your most previous experience, let's say, @rediq, what your bass was looking like there, and your bonus structure, your bonus package, if you had one, and how that was allocated to yourself.

### You (2026-01-28T15:40:27.747Z)

Basis 190. The Berkadia had a very generous profit sharing program.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:40:34.624Z)

Sa. Ving.

### You (2026-01-28T15:40:37.027Z)

That was available to both the product team as well as their brokerage and mortgage servicing teams. They were very generous with 401k contributions. Everything else.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:40:53.424Z)

This.

### You (2026-01-28T15:40:53.507Z)

Reported.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:40:53.584Z)

Was really good. Yes, we have very question. I mean, we'd be interested and does that just include. Was that just a bonus?

### You (2026-01-28T15:40:53.747Z)

Income over the last couple years when that 2:25 to 2:30 range. Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:09.424Z)

Okay. So do you have. Did you have a percentage? Of what that bonus was.

### You (2026-01-28T15:41:14.627Z)

No, it's discretionary.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:16.144Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:41:17.267Z)

It was typical between 15 and 20.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:21.424Z)

Perfect. And was that based on your own individual performance or company performance?

### You (2026-01-28T15:41:26.307Z)

Both.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:27.024Z)

Okay? Was that sort of like a 50, 50 split between the two?

### You (2026-01-28T15:41:33.907Z)

You know, not actually. The. The company bonus was one that was between 15 and 18. The discretionary personal bonus was up to 10, so. Pretty much every single year. I was maxed out on both.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:49.424Z)

Okay, Perfect. And was that allocated to yourself every quarter or yearly?

### You (2026-01-28T15:41:56.307Z)

It was yearly.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:41:57.424Z)

Okay? Brilliant. 401k match. Do you remember the percentage that you were receiving at your previous company?

### You (2026-01-28T15:42:09.267Z)

House. I was driving a total of 19%. But their match, I think, was capped at six.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:42:18.464Z)

Okay? Okay? And sort of other additional benefits that you'd be wanting to receive, I'm sure, perhaps equity. Ltis medical insurance, I'm sure is up there. Too.

### You (2026-01-28T15:42:33.107Z)

Well. You know, that depends. I know. If it's, you know, a larger firm, technically equity is off the table, but with a startup, absolutely. In fact, both of the startups. May present an opportunity for me to Parker as well. That's not off the table either at this time. Understand how many startup. You decrease in the salary in exchange for equity. So, yes, I'm absolutely open to that.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:43:09.504Z)

Okay? Perfect. So do you have an expectation of what a base package would a base salary would look like in another position and also what the ote as well?

### You (2026-01-28T15:43:24.227Z)

No. You know, I haven't really put down anything. Any minimums on paper.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:43:28.464Z)

Actually. Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:43:32.387Z)

There's one movie startups that I'm working with right now, it's sweat equity. And I'm okay with, you know, just depends on the opportunity. If I feel that, if we're talking about startup, I feel that. There's potential. Market. And I'm confident in the leadership. Exchange. We're paying for more equity. I'm kind of at the long run at this point.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:44:02.784Z)

Yeah, understood. And travel. You said that you were open to Travel and our LinkedIn exchange. So do you have a percentage in mind of how much you're willing to travel or how often?

### You (2026-01-28T15:44:16.227Z)

No. I don't really have any issues there with Real Page. Like I mentioned, their business models growth through acquisition. So I was actually working out of my home, but we had an office in Minneapolis, Costa Mesa, Dallas and Atlanta. And. I was traveling to all of those offices.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:44:40.144Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:44:40.707Z)

Usually about three weeks out of a month, anywhere from 15 to 75% and, you know, that's fine.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:44:53.264Z)

Perfect. And just a few more questions for myself. How I would more than happy to then if you have any questions answer. But I know that you are currently consulting, so would you have to stop consulting and would you have to put in a notice period for any of these companies? I'm not too sure how your agreements are right now.

### You (2026-01-28T15:45:14.787Z)

They're very flexible.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:45:16.624Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-28T15:45:17.667Z)

Neither one of them. Are. It's basically.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:45:22.544Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-28T15:45:23.187Z)

As needed.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:45:23.424Z)

So.

### You (2026-01-28T15:45:25.347Z)

One of them. We had a very quick. Startup. And now my involvement has been very little while they go out and attempt to raise some funds. And the other one's kind of the opposite there at the very beginning. They have yet to put together their proof of concept and MVP yet, but that's been mostly consulting. And I've done some client outreach and client feedback to validate the product, but that set the stage that they're at right now.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:46:01.424Z)

Okay, Brilliant. And do you have any non compete or NDAs at all? Perfect. And I know that you are actively looking around to see what other positions are out there full time. So if you don't mind giving me some names perhaps of companies that you have been applying for in the interview process with, especially if they are obviously prop tech space, which I'm sure they are. Yeah. I just don't want to present you any opportunities you've kind of been in the works with already.

### You (2026-01-28T15:46:30.467Z)

I don't have anything in the works already. And what I say I'm actively working, it's just I'm semi actively looking.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:46:33.664Z)

Okay? Okay. Okay. That's totally fine.

### You (2026-01-28T15:46:40.307Z)

Been a while since I submitted a resume, so I can't imagine that there's anybody out there that you know if they're looking for a currently open room that I. I've had contact with.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:46:53.184Z)

Okay? All right, well, that's everything from my side. Howard, I do really appreciate, you know, going into that extra detail really helps me out. I do believe that you could potentially be a good fit for the Platform Services position. I do have both of those jobs posted on my LinkedIn, so if you want to have a look at them, you're more than happy to. But I do think that it would be a good opportunity to put yourself forward for this position. So I will give you a bit of background about the company, what they do and what's going on there and why they are looking for a new vp. So you may have heard of the company already. It's a company called Lightbox.

### You (2026-01-28T15:47:36.867Z)

It sounds familiar, but I can't say that. I'm well familiar with what they do.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:47:40.944Z)

Okay? Yeah, no, not a problem at all. So it is a commercial real estate platform for data analytics and location intelligence. They delivered geospatial intelligence and property data solutions. So kind of from a recent experience, I think that could really intertwine quite well. They have just acquired 11 different companies. So when you were talking about acquisitions, and that's kind of been your experience. I thought that would be a great thing to put you forward for the platform services, because they are looking for someone to kind of integrate these platforms into one interface. So, I mean, that kind of aligns to when you said you're a real page and you had integrating of two platforms, right?

### You (2026-01-28T15:48:22.307Z)

Yes. Absolutely.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:48:26.064Z)

The compensation we're looking at right now is a bit. Is higher than what you were at when you were at rediq. So that is also a big benefit as well. But, yeah, they're looking for a VP of product on the data platform side, and then, like I said, a VP of product for the platform. Services side. So yeah, I'm really interested to put you forward for the platform services side. Like I said, I have that job description posted on my LinkedIn. You can have a look. But what I'm going to do after I'll call Howard is send you an email for your resume consent. Just so I get the thumbs up of sending your resume across to Lightbox once they have a review of it and they're interested in having conversation with you or get back in touch with yourself, let you know what times if they are happy to move forward, and then we'll set up those initial conversations.

### You (2026-01-28T15:48:54.387Z)

Okay? All right, that sounds good. I appreciate it.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:49:18.224Z)

Perfect. And of course, the name will be in the resume consent too. So if you want to do a bit of extra research about the company, see what you think, let me know. But I'll send that email across right away. But, yeah, hopefully we can get something sorted quite quickly.

### You (2026-01-28T15:49:34.067Z)

All. Right. So I'm still appreciate that.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:49:35.424Z)

Perfect. Appreciate your time, Howard. Like I said, I'll send that across. And I will send you the job description, too, so you can have a look at that. But, yeah, appreciate it.

### You (2026-01-28T15:49:45.827Z)

Great. Thank you.

### Guest (2026-01-28T15:49:46.784Z)

Thank you, Howard. Speak soon. Bye. Bye.
