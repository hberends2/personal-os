# Transcript for: User Agreement/TOS review

### You (2025-08-12T17:00:48.043Z)

Hey. Good morning. Or good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:00:50.203Z)

Good morning.

### You (2025-08-12T17:00:52.843Z)

As you're digging so far.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:00:55.083Z)

That's good. How is yours?

### You (2025-08-12T17:00:56.683Z)

Not bad. Not bad. Working on visualization of the roadmap. So getting everything in Jira and. Learning how to use Jira again. It's something that I used years ago. And then I've taken a couple of quick online update classes. But they've made a lot of changes. Obviously, with everything going on. I was never a big fan of it. To begin with, but really it's a tool that's primarily for engineers. But it does have a good roadmap. And it's connected to what I've been saying that we need to start or I need to start scheduling a call with us. To prioritize a lot of future projects.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:01:59.083Z)

Roadmapping.

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:01.163Z)

And then that there's multiple views, just like everything. You can look at it. As a Kanban. Or you can look at it. On a timeline basis. And it's very. It is actually pretty easy to use once you get it set up.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:02:18.123Z)

How are we thinking about in the AI roadmap? Things like we've talked about. The API integrations or the agentic connections.

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:18.363Z)

How are we thinking about AI things like talked about the API and information learning agentic connections with the pro cores and the different communication like how we're able to potentially send things out to investors or broker like the communication piece of it.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:02:27.723Z)

With the pro cores and the different communication, like how we're able to potentially send things out to. Investors or broker, like the communication piece of it.

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:41.963Z)

How are those two things baked into the AI roadmap?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:02:42.043Z)

How are those two things? Baked into the AI roadmap.

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:46.603Z)

Well, first off, let's just distinguish. API has nothing to do with AI totally.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:02:51.803Z)

Oh, okay.

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:52.683Z)

Different age. Totally separate.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:02:53.083Z)

Totally separate. Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:02:53.563Z)

Okay? Yeah. API is something that's been around for many, many years. It's just a way you can think of it. That we have a database. And that database is full of tables. That are nothing but rows and copps. Like excel. And so an API is saying this particular data is located in this table. And it connects to. Your table. That has the same data. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:03:28.683Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:03:29.323Z)

They could be totally different names. Totally different. Everything but it's really a mapping tool.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:03:34.763Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:03:35.723Z)

So that way you don't have to copy paste all this other stuff like you used to do.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:03:38.843Z)

I see.

### You (2025-08-12T17:03:40.123Z)

So I'm going to take this value from your table and put it in this column. And row in my table.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:03:49.803Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:03:50.363Z)

That's how it works. As far as the others APIs, honestly, I really think that's going to be user driven. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:04:01.163Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:04:03.243Z)

At least in terms of prioritization. We need to find out exactly what data they want. We may have users that say, this is awesome. But I'm not going to do me any good until you have this.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:04:13.803Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-12T17:04:17.163Z)

And that'll help us decide our roadmap. Right now we know or we have a list of potential. Partners from an API standpoint. But we have no idea yet. What the cost is, whether they're even willing to have an API.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:04:38.523Z)

Clients, right?

### You (2025-08-12T17:04:43.963Z)

Everybody has a different point of view. Some of them want to share the data. And use it as their own sales pipeline. Others, like I've said before, will fight tooth and nail to that group. They'll make it as difficult as possible. So just using Procore as an example. Do we know that they want to. Share. An API. Right. Conversations with them. Or done anything else to make sure. I did send out that screenshot. Of the roadmap. You're putting together the pitch deck, and that's probably. From a visual standpoint, the easiest way to present it in a PowerPoint.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:05:29.803Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:05:30.523Z)

Yeah. If you do a Gantt chart, type or timeline, by the time you compress it. Into an 8 1/2 inch wide power point. It's almost unreadable. Yeah. I mean, you can format it any way you want. But that really is kind of a high level. And it does break down the AI in phases. And you'll see, just like we've been talking about document processing AI summary early. And then there's the fourth slide on. There's basically version 1.1 and later.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:06:13.483Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:06:13.963Z)

So it's just saying that it may not be out the day that version one goes out. But since we just continuously develop and release and process, it could be two weeks, it could be two years. Depending on that. And it is broken out by high value. Basically, anything that's high value and low development work are the first things that we're doing. So they're already on there. Then there's high value medium that are on there. Those would be like version 1.1 and earlier. And then there's some that are high value, high development effort. Those will be the long term ones. Some of them, they're a stretch that we could do. But I did my best to put it in there in a way that makes sense. That you can just touch on really quickly. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:11.963Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:14.123Z)

Drew your off camera today.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:14.283Z)

Drew your off camera today.

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:16.843Z)

Well, I'm driving.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:17.083Z)

While I'm driving. But I was looking at that thing that Howard just talking about sending. But I'm driving.

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:23.003Z)

That thing with Howard. Just talking about something. But I'm driving. So for me. I don't want to be right now, but I got canceled.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:27.963Z)

So the meeting. I was. I had another meeting with that right now, but it got canceled.

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:32.043Z)

So I'm able to join.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:32.363Z)

So I'm able to join.

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:33.243Z)

Good. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:07:33.723Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-12T17:07:37.003Z)

So, Drew, really the bottom line very quickly. Could be a short meeting. Is Diane and I met yesterday. I did a little AI analysis of your agreement versus the one that I had put together earlier to see if there are any gaps. And what might be missing. And if you looked at the tilde on there, really, your agreement had almost everything that we needed. The one that I had put together earlier had a few gaps. But the one thing that was missing from both is the AI Terminology.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:13.083Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-12T17:08:13.163Z)

That we need to add in, so. I know Diane pinged you yesterday. Asking if it would help for her to take over, and so I told her that I'll schedule this call and we can talk about it. And Diane, I'll let you go ahead and discuss through what you had in mind.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:32.203Z)

Yeah. So wait, are we talking about two to seven things, though? This is the user agreement versus the operating agreement.

### You (2025-08-12T17:08:32.523Z)

Absolutely. We have a concern versus the outbreak agreement, right?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:37.083Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-12T17:08:37.883Z)

Yes. This is the agreement that our clients will sign in on.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:43.003Z)

So, yeah, I'm happy to jump in on either.

### You (2025-08-12T17:08:44.443Z)

Either.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:44.843Z)

But, Drew, I thought it might help on the operating agreement. If you want to pass that off to me. Because I know it was just a matter of choosing A or B. Choose A or B. Right is what you said. And you just needed someone with common sense to go through it.

### You (2025-08-12T17:08:45.243Z)

But. I know. Just a matter of. A or b, right? Just needs common sense to go through it. And think about it.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:08:57.483Z)

And think about it. And I have time this week, so I can do that.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:00.363Z)

Times week, so I can do that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:02.283Z)

Yeah. That'd be great. I'm very swamped this week, so that would be great if you can.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:03.963Z)

Very small this week, so that would be great. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:06.283Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:06.523Z)

My apologies. I got them. Flip flop there.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:09.243Z)

No problem. And then on the user agreement, it sounds like we just need to.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:11.163Z)

And then it sounds like we just need to. I mean, is there a way we could pirate it someone else?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:14.203Z)

I mean, is there a way we could hire it from someone else? Like Elise. AI or someone that might have. I'm just trying to think who might have. Good AI Language.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:19.803Z)

Like Elise AI or someone that might have. I'm just trying to think who might have. Good. AI.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:27.083Z)

I can ask my attorney to add it.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:27.163Z)

Can ask my attorney to add it. He probably do it in 15 minutes.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:30.923Z)

He probably do it 15 minutes.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:32.603Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:32.843Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:33.803Z)

You might even have some template language.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:33.883Z)

You might even have some template language.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:35.403Z)

That's what my train does a lot is he's got templates.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:36.523Z)

My attorney does a lot. He's like, he's got templates.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:38.683Z)

Like this operating agreement template.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:38.843Z)

Like this operating agreement. That template.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:40.923Z)

There's no cost for that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:41.003Z)

There's no cost for that.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:42.283Z)

He just provided it.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:42.443Z)

He just provided it as, like, part of being his customer, his client.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:43.243Z)

As part of being customers, right?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:46.603Z)

So if he has some staple AI language, he can just provide it to us, and we can just stick it in wherever we think it belongs.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:46.763Z)

So if he has provided to us. And we can just stick it in if you can review it.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:52.763Z)

And he can review it.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:54.363Z)

Take it 10 minutes.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:54.523Z)

Taking ten minutes.

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:55.483Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:09:55.643Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:09:56.043Z)

So the version that I had put together was based on existing SaaS agreements. But what I overlooked was like the AI and I didn't have two way indemnification. We had it where the users indemnified us, but we didn't have any language in there of us indemnifying the users. Those are the big things, but, yeah. Essential. Essentially, the bulk of what I had in is a standard SAS agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:10:28.123Z)

And it does allow us to aggregate and autonomize data.

### You (2025-08-12T17:10:29.963Z)

To aggregate an autonomy.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:10:32.523Z)

Right. Unless they elect out, okay.

### You (2025-08-12T17:10:34.443Z)

Elect ric. That is specifically mentioned in there. Now@red IQ. Initially we had a checkbox in the agreement where they either opt in or opt out and. It caused a lot of confusion. And so we changed it. About a year ago, and I modeled this one. After that change, where by default they're opted in and then if they don't want to share, we'll have a user. The account admin will be able to log in. Check the box, confirm that they don't want to share their data. And that worked out really well. Because we actually had some users who opted out at the very beginning. And once we showed them what we were doing with the data, they opted back in. As of the end of last year. We had, like, 79.8% of all clients were opted in, and it was growing, actually, quite a bit.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:11:49.883Z)

It's a lot.

### You (2025-08-12T17:11:54.283Z)

First off because it was by default. But then we started actually showing users what we were putting together, and a lot of them flip flopped.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:06.363Z)

Okay? Good. So, Drew, you'll talk with your attorney about template language?

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:09.003Z)

Off with your attorney about template language. On that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:11.163Z)

On that.

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:13.643Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:13.723Z)

Okay? And then just off the topic.

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:15.963Z)

Off the topic.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:16.923Z)

That what you sent over, Howard, was so interesting.

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:17.003Z)

That what you sent overhead was so interesting. It was Julius. Is that the name of the platform?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:19.563Z)

Is Julius. Is that the name of the platform? That's the yep. How does that impact? Like, could one of our potential clients.

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:24.283Z)

How does that impact one of our potential clients?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:27.643Z)

Just use Julius and not use us? Like. Is that, like, a threat? An existential threat to us?

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:27.803Z)

Just use Julius. And now he discussed. Threat to us. No.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:34.523Z)

I'm just curious.

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:36.043Z)

I don't view it as a threat at all. I did respond to the chat. But basically what it was is that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:12:40.443Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:12:44.283Z)

Pretty much everything we offer, a user could go out and do themselves. Using multiple tools. So our business values that we're consolidating it. And Julius does have individual plans, but they also have an enterprise plan. And that's where I was thinking is that we would be the client of Julius and use their back end tool, something like that internally would take us forever to develop, right?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:13:07.163Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-12T17:13:14.203Z)

We don't want to waste our time. That would be the perfect example of us. Using a third party tool to do that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:13:26.203Z)

What is Julius again?

### You (2025-08-12T17:13:27.803Z)

Julius is the one that I sent out. I sent it to.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:13:34.203Z)

I have not checked the last batch. I'm sure.

### You (2025-08-12T17:13:37.003Z)

Yeah. No. It's the financial analysis AI that incorporates predictive analytics. I mean, it actually does have a modal where they basically, it is a data science. Tool. So it doesn't have to be financials. It could be other things, but they kind of focus on the financial side. And because Diane and I, this kind of started yesterday. Diane and I were talking about, do we ever need a data scientist on the team? Right. My thought was no, because. Back in 2021, 2022. I think time magazine called data science the sexiest job, right? Because it was everywhere. Paying amazing salaries. And AI is just catching up. With the data scientists did is they essentially wrote themselves out of a job by creating all these different algorithms. And now AI can just use those same algorithms and there's really no use for it. So why hire a data scientist when you can use something like that? There could be something very specialized where we could. I've got a lot of data scientists that I've worked with in these different companies. We could always consult if we had to. But I just. I just don't see a need for it when we can use a tool like that. Yeah. Yeah. Check it out if you get a chance. I mean. Someone who compiles reports and financial reports. I think. I think you'll find it really very interesting.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:15:29.643Z)

One of the biggest pain points our customers have that I had. I know. Diane, you're familiar with this.

### You (2025-08-12T17:15:32.923Z)

Our customers have. I know that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:15:36.923Z)

Is writing commentary. Is like some people are really good at it. Do it really fast.

### You (2025-08-12T17:15:40.443Z)

Some people don't do that.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:15:42.043Z)

I'm horrible at it, really. Slow. So it took me a really long time. But I imagine if you organize the data.

### You (2025-08-12T17:15:49.563Z)

Organize the data.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:15:53.723Z)

In a tabular, structured format with all the hierarchy of revenue is expenses.

### You (2025-08-12T17:15:56.043Z)

Structure. Format.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:15:59.883Z)

Cost of goods, sold all this stuff. There'd be a system out there that could say, okay. Here's how. Here's your commentary. Here's a paragraph or two of commentary. On? What's going on? Pretty easily. It's almost like a. Creates a bridge analysis.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:17.323Z)

Analysis.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:17.883Z)

And if that bridge analysis has comments on individual expense items.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:18.043Z)

And it's that group analysis has comments on individual s. Right. Now go in and write the paragraph for you.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:21.883Z)

Right. Then the AI could go in and write the paragraph for you. As to what were the major drivers of the change.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:26.603Z)

As to what major drivers of the change.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:29.643Z)

Is that what you're talking about, Drew?

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:29.643Z)

Is that what we're talking about?

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:31.243Z)

Well, even if you took, like, a trial balance.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:32.123Z)

It took. Pretty much.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:34.043Z)

Or even just a pnl. You got the data in the phenotype structured in the right way. You put it through a model and say, give me two paragraphs of what's going on here.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:42.283Z)

What's going on? Here.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:43.483Z)

Months at eight and year to date or forecast or whatever. And it would say revenues are up by this much because of X, Y and Z details. And expenses are down this much or up this much because of X. Talk about margin.

### You (2025-08-12T17:16:54.843Z)

Expensive. Margin.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:16:58.203Z)

I mean, you probably could teach it. What is adr? What is revpar? What is power? Occupied room or whatever. But maybe it would already intuit those things.

### You (2025-08-12T17:17:07.643Z)

But then if you just write your commentary for you.

### You (2025-08-12T17:17:08.683Z)

Commentary. For you.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:17:11.163Z)

It would be awesome. Yeah, you could probably charge $500.

### You (2025-08-12T17:17:16.363Z)

Know.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:17:18.283Z)

I know wild companies pay $500. Every time they paid this outside guy to do it.

### You (2025-08-12T17:17:20.603Z)

Every time.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:17:22.523Z)

Paying $500. So you'd probably charge at least that for somebody to write commentary once a month.

### You (2025-08-12T17:17:23.803Z)

We charge at least that. For some reason, commentary. With a tool like Julius or anything similar to that. You could also then have access to external data. I mean, we'll have our own aggregated data. If we have enough data in a particular market, you can compare the results to our aggregated data. It could go out to different third party sources online. Scrape, do whatever you need to do. And not only compare to just within the deal year over year or trending. You could just really put together very thorough report doing that. That's worse.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:18:06.763Z)

Is that what you're thinking of using? Yeah. Is that what you were thinking of using for the deal write up?

### You (2025-08-12T17:18:13.403Z)

A lot of them can do that, but, yeah. It will do that. Like I said, I put the link in the chat. I can send it to you just to be sure. But take a look at. And. And it's not a new tool. It's not something that just popped up. They've been around for a while. But now they've kind of gone out to using more AI, so they've got a reputation huge. Companies use them. They've got quite the clientele lists.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:18:47.723Z)

And I just wanted to mention this is more like longer term. If we need source documents.

### You (2025-08-12T17:18:52.043Z)

Source documents.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:18:53.483Z)

I uploaded a handful of documents, although I think I uploaded them to my private files and I need to make them shared files.

### You (2025-08-12T17:18:55.563Z)

Although I think I upload them to my private files and I need to make them shared files. But when I upload a very good template.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:01.243Z)

But what I uploaded was a very good template. For forecast accuracy from an operator that's very, very good. It just needs a couple of things added. Drew. I actually found a Trinity acquisition model for when I was a Portman. They underwrote the Orlando Hyatt.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:05.163Z)

For forecast accuracy from an operator. It's very good. It just needs a couple things added. Actually has a Trinity acquisition model before. Orlando hired, and their template is pretty good.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:22.843Z)

And their template's pretty good.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:24.043Z)

So I put it up there.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:24.363Z)

So I put it up there.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:26.283Z)

We ever needed to see another template.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:26.443Z)

If we ever need to see another template. It includes in it because it's a big group hotel.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:29.963Z)

It includes it because it's a big group hotel. Paints group pace report, which is something we haven't really gone to or talked about yet.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:33.723Z)

Pace group, pace report, which is something we haven't really gotten to or talked about yet.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:37.803Z)

Because.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:38.123Z)

Because this is the scooter.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:40.283Z)

The scooter. I also found a really good marketing plan that I think we were to look at tremendous opportunity that people don't dive deep enough into those marketing plans to find data.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:19:42.443Z)

I also found a really good marketing plan that I think if, like, if we were to look at it, There's tremendous opportunity that people don't dive deep enough into those marketing plans. To find data. And there were a few other things that I put the usali not the most recent addition, but the addition before it because it was free and I don't have and I had to pay for the most recent new Sally but those definitions are all up there as well.

### You (2025-08-12T17:19:55.083Z)

And there were a few other things that Sally. Most recent before because it was free. And I don't have. And I had to pay for lush recipe, sally. But those definitions are all up there as well.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:20:12.203Z)

In case anyone needs them.

### You (2025-08-12T17:20:13.163Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:20:13.643Z)

Yeah. But anyway, you might get a kick out of the Trinity acquisition model because it is pretty. It's a pretty good model.

### You (2025-08-12T17:20:18.603Z)

You might get a kick out of the Trinity Acquisition auto because it is a pretty good model. And it's all said and done.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:20:23.643Z)

And it's all said and done.

### You (2025-08-12T17:20:24.843Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:20:25.243Z)

Yeah. I have a Trinity Davidson and a bunch of others that I've kind of put to use to put together my own model. But, yeah, Theirs was very. I mean, they do big boxes. They said that it was very detailed. It has, like, food and beverage. Like the Berkadia between catering and banquet and all. So when we get to that point,

### You (2025-08-12T17:20:45.963Z)

Catering. And so when we get to that point, There are some good templates that are high up level detailed enough that you're getting granular with high that it's not going to blow an acquisition person's brain apart.

### Guest (2025-08-12T17:20:49.563Z)

There are some good templates that are high enough level, well, detailed enough that you're getting into granular, but high enough that it's not gonna blow an acquisition person's brain apart.

### You (2025-08-12T17:21:04.203Z)
