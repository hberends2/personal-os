### Guest (2025-06-11T22:00:36.776Z)

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:42.027Z)

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:44.887Z)

Yeah. They have certain policy of two month payment.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:00:46.546Z)

Yeah. I think they have certain policy of two month payment or something like that.

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:49.407Z)

K. So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:00:52.036Z)

So

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:52.457Z)

to take company that won't be done, they won't be paid.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:00:54.666Z)

the company that hold my visa, they are not getting paid.

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:55.647Z)

Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:00:57.926Z)

So I don't know, they won't pay from their own pocket. So that makes sense.

### You (2025-06-11T22:00:59.367Z)

market. So Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. I guess. I mean, that's risk you take, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:01:07.836Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:01:09.127Z)

You've been you've been a lot of work, which is great.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:01:12.036Z)

You've been doing a lot of work, which is great.

### You (2025-06-11T22:01:12.927Z)

Yeah. It's it's been going pretty well. And, you know, I I think the issue with that Diane put down in the chat and or excuse me, in the email.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:01:24.366Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-11T22:01:25.657Z)

I have the calculation correct. I just used the wrong abbreviation. But Yeah. I need to have a conversation

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:01:31.176Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-06-11T22:01:33.857Z)

with Diane and Drew because Drew told me the ADR and POR are nearly identical

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:01:43.246Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-11T22:01:44.237Z)

They're they're both occupied rooms. But I think I think the POR does not include comped rooms. So if you have somebody that is staying for free, like if they use their points

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:02:01.006Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-11T22:02:02.997Z)

or something like that, it's excluded. But we don't get we don't have that information. We only know how many rooms are there and how many rooms are rented. So I just wanna make sure that we're all on the same page with the terms because I don't think I think Drew is more knowledgeable about that than Diane, honestly, because he's working in the data side.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:02:25.236Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:02:27.097Z)

Yep. Right. But as soon as we get that cleared up, we should be good. And she did mention a couple other items that go before the NOI. So I can slip those in The only thing I have, and I I forgot to mention, is I'm wondering what I did is I built that drop down box where they can choose either ADR or of revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:02:52.906Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-06-11T22:02:53.197Z)

Okay. That applies to everything. Down below in the expenses. I I don't know if there would ever be a situation where you might wanna use one or the other at the line item level. I hope not. Yes. That's gonna make

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:09.466Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:09.797Z)

a whole lot of drop down boxes. In that. But we'll we'll see. And, you know, maybe that's something

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:14.676Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:17.657Z)

we also have to get the user feedback on. So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:20.976Z)

Yep. It it makes sense.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:21.047Z)

Yep. It it makes sense. It makes sense. So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:24.416Z)

Makes sense. So

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:25.817Z)

time is to get some push to store that to

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:27.176Z)

whatever analyst we are supposed to show that to

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:28.447Z)

shouldn't show up. Doing some push for it. Don't think it shows

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:30.406Z)

Should we show are we supposed to show it on the actual platform or the one you've already built is good enough?

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:36.937Z)

think I think it's good enough. I wouldn't we don't don't need to have an invest. Or investai.com. URL when we're showing it. Yeah. We can just show it as a

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:47.236Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:49.147Z)

mean, and be upfront about it. We don't have to make it look like it is.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:49.316Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:53.577Z)

Mean, we just have to say this is our development environment and

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:54.416Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:03:56.877Z)

you know, this is what we plan to push to production and

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:03:57.116Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:00.797Z)

this is what it is. Yeah. I mean, that that makes sense. And then we'll have to

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:03.516Z)

Yeah. I mean, that that makes sense. And then we'll have to

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:06.307Z)

probably see. Where to

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:08.506Z)

probably see

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:08.807Z)

stay then. Kind of Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:09.616Z)

where to host it and then kind of

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:11.227Z)

Spend some money and all that.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:12.146Z)

spend some money and all that.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:12.767Z)

I mean, honestly, I think what we could do is on the front end that you're building, Yeah. That's kinda like the landing page. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:18.996Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:21.927Z)

And then and then

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:22.076Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:23.657Z)

you were also working on, like, the deal details page.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:24.966Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:26.807Z)

Deal. The pipeline, whatever we end up calling it. Right. So you could have a pipeline

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:30.466Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:32.867Z)

that's populated with a bunch of fake names. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:37.266Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-11T22:04:37.347Z)

But one of them you know, you could have one like the very top one. Actually, the prop or have a link there where don't know what we wanna do. If we wanna just click on the property name or if there's a link, but then you could just put the URL in that link, then it could just open up what I have. Right? Make it look like it's all in one system. We don't have to have a hand off or anything like that.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:04:58.296Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:01.637Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:04.796Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We can definitely do that.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:07.427Z)

And I did send you those screenshots just as an FYI. Yeah. Yeah. Those are the ones that

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:13.866Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:15.037Z)

Diane also she sent me that information.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:20.266Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:21.817Z)

It it it's just an idea. You know? Okay. It's not the only idea and probably not the best

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:26.986Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:28.657Z)

idea. So

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:28.756Z)

Is it clear?

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:29.957Z)

if you have a a different way that you have already started to set up the pipeline or deal details that that's fine.

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:05:41.626Z)

Okay. I'm back.

### You (2025-06-11T22:05:41.687Z)

### You (2025-06-11T22:06:14.707Z)

Okay. I haven't seen email. Look for that. It is a nice modern design, but if it doesn't fit with what you've already put together, then

### Guest (2025-06-11T22:06:19.156Z)

look for that. Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-11T22:06:23.147Z)
