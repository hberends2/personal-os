# Transcript for: InnVest All Team Working Call

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:31:10.384Z)

Right. Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-08-21T21:31:13.062Z)

How are you doing?

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:31:14.464Z)

Good. How are you?

### You (2025-08-21T21:31:15.382Z)

Good. So, Drew, what's happening in your world?

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:31:40.144Z)

Hello? Hello? We have this big demo with this customer in Australia that I'm just getting ready for yesterday. Then it was with me today. Now it's going to be next week. I'll be focusing on. What time is the demo for you, Drew? It's 3:30 on Tuesday, so 8:30aM Wednesday, their time. Hopefully. Hopefully it goes well. We have not had any customers. Over a year. On, mark. Hello again. Hello. Hello. Hey guys. I've talked to most of you today except for Vinod. So I will share the news. Vinod, we have our first investor for $50,000. It's a friend of mine. So it is a friend and family. But he's going to invest via Safe Note, and that's exciting news. Our first investor. Amazing. Amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. All right, so where do we want to start today? Should we go through the technical side first, or. I'm still working on the llc, so I don't have any updates other than it's just taking me longer to slug through it than I thought it would. So I'm not sure. What are the most important updates we cover today? I can demo you guys. Okay, Something that is a little exciting. Not 100% there, but still some good progress. Okay, let me share my screen. Yeah. Please let me know and you can see it. I think this one I already showed you last time, so I'll just create a deal here. Say. I don't think this is direct one. Anyway, let's go with this document for now. Okay, I'm dropping Excel file there. Okay, so the deal is created here. Let's see what all I see. Yeah. Irr ni's are not getting calculated. And hopefully that will be there soon. Before we actually go there. Let me close that. You can actually see what's in the deal detail page and there is still few quiz missing here. I think we got something here. Yet to be validated, whether that is correct, but it's getting from the extraction, which is good. We're going to remove all these values. And from the Deal detail page we can go to view Performa and I believe to see some values here in the performer page. And I also see some values here. Again, the validations are yet to be done. Let's say we have some something coming up in the OpenC. We do have some data in occupancy as well. Same here. So this is something we need to work on. Expenses. All4. 2024. So I believe that she just has 2024 data. Occupancy. Year on year growth. Okay? Atr. So it's actually starting to populate. Right. There was the Excel file you dropped in just for 2024. Or did it have prior year info? I'll open that access sheet as well. But, yeah, there's some data that we still need to test the excel sheet I just uploaded. Okay? I don't think it shows the correct here right now. But this is it. I uploaded. So, yeah, I think that year is correct. So that's it. I still need to validate that data. But. You know what? I think I can upload on average, one that will actually. Let's see. What better result? And then I would also upload a PDF and see, because we are actively working on that today. And Let me get 1amp reach 1. Let's see. This one and let me open the Excel sheet first. That would have a summary tab. It does. Let's try that. Looks a complicated one. Okay, so we have added here it Ambridge. And let's see. ADR is 9. 9. Let's correct. Yellow close. Roll that average. Is. Working. That actually reminds me that the way we calculate ADR and revar as like a weighted average so all the rooms available for the different months. All the rooms sold for the month, and then you calculate. As opposed to doing a straight line averaging all the ADRs and RevPars for the month. Yeah. Okay, so we did extract the formulas from the prds. I think that's what we'll double check. I'll double check. I haven't done any of that testing yet. And then if I go in the forma, So I see similar matrix here. One second. I have this little guy here. Send him downstairs. One more, please. While the note is away, Mark and Diane, one thing that I talk with Howard about. The other day was about FF and E, specifically. Contribution. To the reserves. And building in some kind of. Some way. That if a user puts in capex assumptions, right, like how much they want to spend on capex, that it will consider how much you have in your FNE reserve. And if you're going to spend more than that, Then it'll factor that in as it would have to be a capital call. Typically, those are different things. Right? Like, if you're buying a hotel, major capital improvement. That wouldn't be covered in revenue rate. That would be a separate line item. Well, yeah. I think what I wanted to. I think there are a couple of different scenarios we need to consider and I need to graph the email to you guys where I was going to copy hard on as well. To just lay out the scenarios, make sure that we're covering the possible options, whether it's is the renovation. Or contributing capital upfront. Or they get a pay for it over time or whatever, however is going to be done. Right? Yeah. Because just for, I guess primarily for Howard and Benod's benefit. The FF&E balance is almost never a sufficient to cover these capital improvements. It's just sort of something that makes everyone feel good about reserving money, but it's very rarely enough, especially for full service, luxury or resort properties. Yeah, I think. Or huge. Said that usually vsF and E reserve. Is like when you sell the hotel, you take that money back, and then when you're the buyer, You get start from zero, right? Yes, for sure. Okay, cool. It's always a fun thing to fight about, but that's generally how it ends. All right. Sorry, vinod. Go ahead. No. Nice. So, let's see. Occupancy shows 56.7. And what do we have here? Yeah, I don't think that's correct either. Is it looking at the further to the right? Or let's see. Oh, it's taking January is what it's doing. I think 56. Oh, yeah, I took this one. Okay, so probably that's where it is. Taking from, which is wrong, okay? Good will. Kind of. Work on that. But, yeah, basically we are getting some extraction done. We just need to continue refining it further. And the UI was already here. We are kind of working on binding everything together now. Extraction, database and the application. And how we can work on UX part together. Whatever improvement we need, like key metrics, right? We wanted to always show it up there. We can work on that or whatever. Navigation, anything. Changes we need.

### You (2025-08-21T21:42:52.582Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:42:54.144Z)

Even though it's in the wrong, even though it's capturing the wrong column, I think it's still, again, still great progress, right? Because you're capturing something. Definitely. We need to kind of sit and test each values. But yeah. Bigger functionality is working, service is working, some of the formulas working. We just need to sit on each and every formulas and kind of test them. That's great.

### You (2025-08-21T21:43:26.982Z)

Yeah. We can either set up a time, or maybe I can just record videos, since it might be helpful to the Offshore team.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:43:39.504Z)

Tomorrow is good time. Howard. I am home. I work home tomorrow. So let's connect to Mohan.

### You (2025-08-21T21:43:41.062Z)

Okay? Fine. Yeah, just minor corrections that we need to make to. Adding or creating a deal modal, few other minor things, but this is looking really good.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:43:59.024Z)

Well, thank you. And then we are kind of able to process the pdfs as well. It is still need to sit on formulas and all that. And the next part would be more towards AI centric creating the summaries and all that. So you're kind of heading in the interaction. Now.

### You (2025-08-21T21:44:21.382Z)

All right. So, Vinod, to your point earlier about getting those cards on top, we can get placeholders for them. Similar to what you have right now, but we have to have all of the data populating and populating correctly before we can calculate those numbers.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:44:41.104Z)

Makes sense.

### You (2025-08-21T21:44:41.142Z)

So yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:44:42.784Z)

Yeah. These matrices you're talking about.

### You (2025-08-21T21:44:45.142Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:44:50.624Z)

It still is super encouraging, though. You're pulling something, right? So we're making progress. And it's just a matter of spending the time to go through and look at the formulas and try to find the right way to get the annual information or identify the annual information. Yeah, there's a lot that goes behind bringing it till this progress. But, yeah, now we'll kind of do the basic math and all that, so should be. That's great. Thank you, Vinod. Thank you very much. I have a question while we're all on the line because we had some email exchange today. What is an LLM? And what do you actually call the database that will be accumulating with all the deal information and the property information and all that? I know, I just wasn't completely false. Howard, I think you said it wasn't an LLM. Technically, right? And then Benodi, you responded with something, but what? Like, how do we describe this to people?

### You (2025-08-21T21:46:01.622Z)

Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:46:05.424Z)

So in simple terms, if possible. Yeah. So it's. How do I say it? It's basically program, which has been trained on lot of data. And then user can basically interact with it, or your application can interact with it in a way that it makes more sense. So it's just in our example, suppose a user upload a PNL and since our program is already trained on lot of pnl, it already knows where exactly what formulas to apply, where exactly to kind of pull the information from. So basically a software. Which has been trained in a space peak where based on the data it has been fed on and then it kind of reacts. Or takes decision based on how it is been trained on the data.

### You (2025-08-21T21:47:18.662Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:47:18.944Z)

And just imagine, hypothetically, five years from now in the future. We're underwrite, like our software is being used to underwrite 50% of the deals in America. And we're pulling up cap rates and age of asset and renovation and all of this information that we're capturing in a data lake. What do we call that? Data lake. Because I thought that was the LLM. That's not an LLM, okay?

### You (2025-08-21T21:47:42.582Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:47:45.264Z)

So even the data lake is different than a database and data warehouse. The different terms. So Data lake is a little raw form of the data warehouse or the final data you have. And so when you initially have rough data, you'll basically keep that in a data lake. But when you refine that data lake further, That becomes your warehouse. And that becomes your single source of truth, which you can use either in your application or BI reporting or training. Your model. Right now, we are neither using data lake or data warehouse, we are simply using a database. And we are using a relational database. Wherein we have all the data in tabular formats.

### You (2025-08-21T21:48:40.902Z)

Yeah. So let me. Diane, let me. Let me explain it this way. Think of our data as being in Excel. So a database is an Excel worksheet. All of the data is neatly compiled. It rows in columns. A data warehouse would be in Excel workbook that has multiple sheets. And you can think of it that if the five of us were different departments of a business, we would each have our own worksheet that has the data. But if we wanted to create reports on the business as a whole, we have to take that data and combine it. And we may have certain columns in those worksheets that are the same. So we would merge them together, right? So that's the data warehouse. Taking individual databases. Putting them all together. Visually, it's a warehouse. Even though you got everything going in there. A data lake. Is data that is not in columns. And tables. Text. You can't put text in a cell. In Excel. I mean, you can type it, right? But text is not something you can do in rows and columns. And so when you're using text in that way, You have to have a data lake. But then there are ways. Then where? In a database. It's very simple. I need this column and this row. And I can navigate it. In a data lake. It's not that thing. I mean, you can imagine that all of your data is in a bucket. And you just toss it in the lake. How do you know where that water that was in your bucket is mixed in with the water in the lake? Right? So it's very specialized, and it's kind of a totally different item than a database in a data warehouse. So we will insert have a data lake like when we are collecting feedback from clients. Because that's data that will go into a database. You can create word clouds. But at the same time. Just like we would in Excel. We could have a data table. It says this user on this date said this comment. Right? So then we can go back and we know who said it. We're going to set it by the data lake. It makes it more difficult. So I think the easiest way to answer is this. We will never have an LLM. That's not what we do. OpenAI google. Anthropic perplexity. They have the LLMs. And an LLM can literally take billions of dollars to create, test, and go out and do that. What we will be doing is we will be using their LLMs to provide the AI power that we need to take our data. And do what we need to do.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:51:58.704Z)

Right. So pause there. Is that all right? Because let this pot right there for a moment. About a year and a half ago, I sat in a presentation about AI and they described it like this. The chatgpt and OpenAI, they're very large LLMs. And so if you have a very niche subject matter, That data is not commonly available for your AI will go out and it will look for that data, but it's not really there. And so they might pull a data bit or two, whatever they can find, but it's not complete. And therefore you like the LLM isn't really capturing that specific bespoke data for that unique industry or niche. And so I swear to God, they said that, well, you'd have to do is create LLMs for the specific little niches so that you could compile enough information that you could go get accurate. This is making sense. Like accurate information about that very bespoke subject.

### You (2025-08-21T21:53:00.342Z)

Yeah. But I would say that they made a mistake in referring to it as an LLM. Because that's what a REG does say. So REG is retrieval, right?

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:53:08.704Z)

Yeah. Okay, that's great.

### You (2025-08-21T21:53:13.382Z)

So we will have all of our data. In our database. And so what we would be doing when we have an AI offering, our users could go in there and say, what is the. You know, how does my property compare to other properties in the market? Or what is the forecast for travel in this particular area? It's going to go out to the LLM and get some of that generic information. But for the precise information related to what we have, it would go and use that Retrieval Augmented system with the reg. And so it combines them. It's not just one or the other. So I think what the people were trying to describe. Is a rag system where basically, I mean, for all intents and purposes, we never really need to say the word LLM or rag to any of our prospects.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:54:13.984Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-21T21:54:15.862Z)

We just let them know that we have a specialized work that we are going to provide AI which will use their data along with third party data, publicly available data. To perform the services that we're going to provide.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:54:35.184Z)

And if you want to see how a database looks, I can show that to you right now.

### You (2025-08-21T21:54:39.702Z)

Yeah, that would be good.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:54:41.584Z)

No. Okay. Diane, just for the sake. When I talk to customers. I say data model.

### You (2025-08-21T21:54:48.902Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:54:49.744Z)

You say, data? What? Data model. Data model, okay? It's sort of a more generic, all encompassing term for whatever it is. But it's really talking about how the data is organized. The really hard part, but the B is also the really important. Part, right?

### You (2025-08-21T21:55:10.182Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I think that's the best way to do it.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:55:12.464Z)

I do think that. I do think that Diane's points are good. I think there's a lot of buzzwords out in the world today that people just hear all over in L M is just something that I hear personally probably 20 times a day.

### You (2025-08-21T21:55:19.862Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:55:27.104Z)

I wonder in our deck if we should just have a little graphic. That just kind of explains in a very 30,000 foot level. Like how it works, because I think people are going to be curious. And everyone knows these buzzwords. And maybe if we just develop, like, a simple graphic, it may help people understand. A diagram how this will flow in our use case. And can I ask a question, though, what I sent around earlier from the web, where they had the leaf and then they had an LLM and then they had a rag and they had something else and something else. Was that accurate to think about it that way? Because they were trying to make the case that this is a very good visual for how to think about AI.

### You (2025-08-21T21:56:10.742Z)

I don't remember it off the top of my head, but from what you described, yes, because the databases and where this data resides is going to be in multiple places all around the world.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:56:11.664Z)

I didn't really say that. Picture.

### You (2025-08-21T21:56:24.102Z)

And so that, to me, probably sounds like the leaves. And then the branches and the trunk would be. The trunk would probably be. Be an LLM that goes out and gets the data from these different branches and brings it back. If that's what it was trying to convey it, then I think, yeah, it's probably a good one.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:56:41.904Z)

Kind of, but not quite. And I'm sorry to be so such a pain in the ass about this, but I just want to make sure that we 've got it down, because as Mark says, there's just a lot of buzzwords around. And hold on. I just want to see. Because it was that. There wasn't a trunk in the picture. There was just giant. One giant leaf that got distributed out. Where did I send this? Maybe I sent it yesterday. Email, and I think I opened it as well, but I didn't go into detail.

### You (2025-08-21T21:57:24.102Z)

I don't remember getting an email with any of that.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:57:29.184Z)

I think I saw that. Did I sign up from my Gmail? Was that a problem? Well, is it all right if I send it back around? And on Tuesday, can we all just look at it? And then on Tuesday, could we use that to walk through the definitions?

### You (2025-08-21T21:57:50.342Z)

That'd be fun.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:57:53.584Z)

No, I actually do have a sense of what a data warehouse and a data lake. And you guys described it even better than how I know it. And, Drew, your comment of a data model is very good. But especially for the non techies that are going to be talking to potential investors and customers, we really should get our language down correctly. And so I will resend it to everyone and I'll leave. Yeah, I got it here. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-21T21:58:35.062Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:58:38.144Z)

Alam versus Sorry. It's small, I know, but I thought it was good.

### You (2025-08-21T21:58:42.342Z)

Yeah, I was going to say I saw it, but I kind of deleted it because I couldn't read a thing that was on there. Sorry.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:58:52.064Z)

Everything in the world. Yeah, it is. Not a lot of things there. I can go back and get a bigger picture of it, I'm sure if I try to pull it back off of. But this is like. I just thought it was good because the green part they call is the LLM, right? And then they have I can see AI agent. I can see agentic AI. And then. The purples, the rag.

### You (2025-08-21T21:59:14.902Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:59:17.744Z)

And maybe to Mark's point, we should put together a visual, something along these lines that fits for us, but just helps to quickly explain how it works and how we're using it. Thank you.

### You (2025-08-21T21:59:32.662Z)

The node. Did you say you had something put together or that you would put something together?

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:59:38.624Z)

Mark was saying that if we could have some image, I can send it across some sort of diagram which will show how it will work in our application.

### You (2025-08-21T21:59:47.942Z)

Well, that's what I meant. I don't know if you already had that or if you're going to put something together.

### Guest (2025-08-21T21:59:52.384Z)

No, I don't have. But I'll send it. Yeah, I mean the urgency we obviously more important things to do right now. But I think it is something that we should have at some point.

### You (2025-08-21T22:00:00.982Z)

Yeah. I think, Diane, this is good because it shows overlap and what's included in each, But I would not want to sit down in front of a client with all of that. On there. We wouldn't need it. Much simpler than that.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:00:17.424Z)

Totally understand. That's good. When I saw it this morning and I saw LLM, and then I saw. Because now the other word is rag, right? That just keeps coming up and up. And an agent keeps coming up and up and up and up.

### You (2025-08-21T22:00:27.782Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:00:30.384Z)

It is a bit hard to understand if you're not technical.

### You (2025-08-21T22:00:34.822Z)

But at the end of the day, we will be in that intersection of all four, because we will have agents that go out and get data from the tax records and other agents that go out and get the sales. And records. Like I did with that Gen Spark. And then we'll have others that go out into our own database. The reg. We're gonna. We're gonna be eventually touching on pretty much all of those areas.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:01:05.664Z)

Thank you. And as Mark says, we have more important things to do right now. I know there's a big push to get vinodin his team through the data, and I'm working on the llc, and Mark is working on the pitch deck, and Howard working on the protocol s, and Drew is helping. On everything. Plus running his own business, so thank you. Okay, Is any. Anything else that we. I mean, because I know we're just kind of all heads down on this. Is there anything else we need to coordinate on? I know I owe Howard. I need to review these PDRs, so I apologize for the delay on that. Please try to do the formula formulas tomorrow.

### You (2025-08-21T22:01:55.542Z)

Yeah. If you can just do the bottom half of that sheet, we should be good to go.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:01:58.224Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-21T22:02:00.022Z)

I think we made the changes as we talked for the first half. So we should be good. On that. I do need to go back and double check like we just were talking for the KPI cards that are on top. I thought we had all of that in there, so let me just double check. And we will need the account end user. Reviewed as well. That one should be very simple.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:02:32.144Z)

And then how do you. And, Howard, you're chatting with your friend tomorrow from Red iq, right? The young woman that you mentioned.

### You (2025-08-21T22:02:40.982Z)

Oh, yeah. Carrie.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:02:44.384Z)

We were. Mark and Drew and I spent a couple of hours together earlier thinking about the presentation into customers and things like that. And I will say that we're really trying to get our heads around it. But when it comes to the graphics, I mean, Drew's doing a really good job of working with AI. But if we know someone who's very good at graphics could probably really help speed up, speed it up for us, right? Because we may have some diagrams that take some real work that can't be done in a simple AI program, and yet other parts can be done in an AI power point. Does it make sense?

### You (2025-08-21T22:03:25.702Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:03:26.304Z)

Some of the slides are just too complex to try to get done in an AI PowerPoint environment. Could she help with something like that, or is that not her?

### You (2025-08-21T22:03:36.342Z)

Let me talk to her tomorrow and find out exactly if she even has the time or. We haven't really confirmed whether or not she's going to be able to help her that. So let me talk to her and I'll update everybody after that conversation.

### Guest (2025-08-21T22:03:38.384Z)

Okay? Thank you. It just piqued my interest as Drew was, like, figuring, trying to figure it out on an AI and it's like, oh, this would be a really great resource for Mark. It could get his ideas down on paper. All right, everyone, well then, half hour back tonight for the group and we will talk Tuesday at 5:30.
