pad. Just write something short like Granola AI. Example. So the way to think about the notepad is that Granola is transcribing in the background

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:26:12.274Z)

Just write something short like Granola AI. For example. So the way to think about the notepad is that Granola is transcribing in the background anyway.

### You (2025-04-20T21:26:20.445Z)

anyway. So you can relax about writing every little detail.

Or things that are in your head that wouldn't have made it into the transcript.

### You (2025-04-20T21:26:27.945Z)

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:03.265Z)

my somewhat similar to yours.

somewhat similar to yours on the right side of your screen.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:06.495Z)

You can see that I

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:07.104Z)

Can see that I took some notes here about kind of specific things that were mentioned in the video that I thought were interesting. This is a great way to use Granola, just writing

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:12.145Z)

This is a great way to use for now, which is writing short, graphing notes around this

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:14.104Z)

short scrappy notes about the stuff that stands out to you.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:15.695Z)

that stands out to you. Okay.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:16.584Z)

Scrappy

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:17.565Z)

One extra thing I wanna tell you

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:17.674Z)

extra thing I wanna show you that you could do in this notepad is

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:19.025Z)

you do in this step, Adam, is as well as Redding

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:20.654Z)

as well as writing

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:21.805Z)

specific one off things like the

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:21.884Z)

specific one off things like this, I can also instruct Granola to

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:24.285Z)

can also instruct one or two. Capture notes on kind of broader

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:25.754Z)

capture notes on kind of broader topics.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:27.355Z)

mix small headings.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:28.504Z)

Or headings. And you can do that with this notation here. So if I do a little hashtag

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:29.395Z)

And you can do that with notation here. So if I do a little hashtag,

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:33.474Z)

and then a space, and I'm gonna say feature

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:34.365Z)

and we're gonna say features from the color.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:36.524Z)

of Granola. I'll do another one that's like

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:38.525Z)

I don't know what. Like.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:41.104Z)

steps to use Granola.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:43.355Z)

This note will be better. It's

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:43.904Z)

This notation will be familiar if you use Markdown,

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:45.975Z)

you need to call back.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:47.024Z)

It's the same notation as the heading in Markdown.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:47.055Z)

It's the same

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:49.654Z)

And the idea is you're instructing Granola to turn this into a heading and collect notes underneath that.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:51.975Z)

to this into a heading. Which you'll see now.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:27:54.544Z)

Which you'll see now. Gonna hit the enhanced notes button, and we'll see Granola do its thing.

### You (2025-04-20T21:27:56.525Z)

Gonna hit and we'll see what I'll do with things.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:28:03.784Z)

Great. And you can see

### You (2025-04-20T21:28:04.925Z)

Great. And you can see So now

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:28:05.934Z)

now Granola has written some notes for me.

### You (2025-04-20T21:28:06.615Z)

it's going. This is a mix of the specific things

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:28:08.364Z)

This is a mix of the specific things that I wrote

### You (2025-04-20T21:28:09.995Z)

for Dagger.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:28:10.614Z)

stuff that I didn't write, but that Granola thought was was worth putting in.

### You (2025-04-20T21:28:10.885Z)

Stuff that I didn't write for the account was was worth the And this

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:28:13.554Z)

And it's used those headings that I wrote earlier.

### You (2025-04-20T21:28:16.695Z)

But they crossed it. Second only merchandise and, you know, to he's invented AMP, He's invented guitars. He's invented guitar rest. He's invented trunnolos. All of which are widely used If you just stick to that, it'd be a revered figure. Despite the immense commercial success, relationships within the band were once again beginning. To strain. Not for the first time. The lead singer became very any don't smoking. Biker outlaw type of guy. And he was not interested his wild ways. With the recording of a soundtrack for film twist I'd be rewrote the lyrics to a track. That Sam Hagar pen called Human's Being And Sami apparently didn't like said the lyric previous were too cheesy.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:22.854Z)

To group stuff underneath.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:23.215Z)

Two

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:25.394Z)

As well as a few extras that I thought would be useful. If you go back, you can see the specific stuff I wrote the headings I wrote,

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:31.625Z)

and then

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:31.714Z)

and then

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:32.705Z)

fine.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:33.264Z)

the output from Granola. Awesome.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:35.145Z)

Causing? Okay. Final thing.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:36.754Z)

Okay. The final thing.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:38.215Z)

This

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:38.404Z)

This is like our automatic template that gets applied after every meeting.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:38.975Z)

is like, a that gets a bite out every day. But

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:42.574Z)

But

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:43.205Z)

Yes. If

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:43.294Z)

if you want something more specific out of your notes, we have a bunch of other templates here.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:43.885Z)

want something more specific, out of your house, we have a bunch of other templates here.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:48.814Z)

You can see like these are the these are the default ones, we also have a bunch more.

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:49.285Z)

Can see, like, you do the you do an performance of yours. How in this menu here.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:52.464Z)

In this menu here. The idea here is you predefine a

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:55.715Z)

By structure built

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:56.924Z)

structure for the notes that you want. So

### You (2025-04-20T21:32:57.945Z)

So I have this user that you want.

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:32:58.864Z)

have this user interview one, which

### You (2025-04-20T21:33:00.075Z)

Which breaks down notes and say,

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:33:00.534Z)

breaks down notes into, like, the user's goal and their pain points and current solutions, blah blah blah.

### You (2025-04-20T21:33:01.835Z)

you just go make what's in

### Guest (2025-04-20T21:33:05.694Z)

I'll apply this and let's see what happens.
