# Transcript for: Howard + Mike Intro

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:31:47.720Z)

I'm good. How are you? Good to see you. Happy post Thanksgiving week. Hope you're recovering well. Yes. Yes. I am so excited to introduce you guys. Howard is just about my favorite person in the entire world right now. I think he walks on water. And what he's done and building out InnVestAI in our underwriting platform has been amazing. He comes from the multifamily space. And Howard, Mike and I connected. I don't know what, about a year. Ago, Mike probably. I think. Yeah, We've known each other through rabbit before, but then, yeah, finally got to really chop it up. Formally like that a year ago or so. Right. And Mike is a great networker. I was really impressed. We reconnected because he reached out to me on LinkedIn and then we chatted and we've been chatting ever since. But he's a unique person because he has technical skills and he has real life project management skills, and he has incredible networking skills, and you don't often find that all in one person. And he has a vision about what he wants to do with his life going forward. So I appreciate the opportunity to introduce you guys. And the main goal here is just like a get to know each other. So that we can so that Mike, you can get to know us and so that Howard, you can get to know Mike and then potentially talk about ways we might work together, which we can save that for the end, but could include one or a combination of Mike helping us be a fractional CFO because he's starting a business like that. And we need a fractional cfo, Mike, potentially helping us brainstorm and think about how we might build out a renovation product. That ties into our underwriting product, given what he's done with Rabbit and with Taylor Byrd and what he knows about the space and the fact that his dad is a project manager and hospitality. And then third, Mike has some really interesting ideas about the future of a very small, bespoke consulting practice. And I'll let Mike explain it better, but really targeted at helping certain core groups of investors with their tech stacks. Which are complicated. Right. And hard to do. And not something everyone wants to have a skill set everyone wants to have in house. So with that, why don't I just start? Howard, do you mind going first, just a quick like who you are, your background, Rediq, and then we'll turn it over to Mike and he can go.

### You (2025-12-02T15:34:34.984Z)

Yeah, sure. Good morning, Mike. Pleasure to meet you.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:34:37.880Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-12-02T15:34:40.344Z)

I've been in commercial real estate for a little over 30 years, and it's pretty much been exclusive to the multifamily. Started off in operations, moved into asset management. Was involved with a lot of acquisitions, renovations, et cetera. But also had a very strong analytics background and skills there. So back about 15 years ago, I worked with RealPage on creating their first consolidated data warehouse. I don't know if you're familiar. We're real page or not. But they are growth through acquisition. They don't invent anything, right? They just take it all and try to mush it together. So had a lot of different products that were completely siloed. And so we put together a data warehouse. And this was really at the beginning of a lot of data warehouse analytics type things. But that's where I got bit by the tech bug and hadn't really looked back much since. So for the last 15 years, it's all been in the prop tech space and again, primarily geared towards multifamily, so. It was primarily BI and analytics and working with energy management, sustainability. And then in 2021, I had an opportunity to join a company called rediq, which is, or was, I'm not going to say it is any longer, but was the leading automated valuation model. For multifamily acquisitions. And I say was because they basically got leapfrogged by a lot of other companies that were really investing heavy in AI. So rediq had a great process for extracting data from roles and financial statements. But at that point, everything kind of went into Excel. But at that time, Rediq was owned by Berkadia, and Berkadia had just opened their first. Hospitality office. And so that's how I met Diane. She had approached some context there that she knew and thought there would be a great opportunity for rediq to expand into the hospitality space. But long story short, Berkadia sold rediq to another company. The other company. It could have been a great match, but it was bad timing. They were caught up in the midst of the Real Page class action lawsuit. So, yeah, it all kind of. My life just kind of orbits around real page, right?

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:37:43.480Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-12-02T15:37:48.264Z)

But long story short, they basically, I'm not going to say shuttered Rediq, but. They moved all of their engineering resources and everybody over to work on their core product. So Reddit. Yeah. Yeah. So rediq still exists.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:38:01.960Z)

This is radix, right? Howard? Yeah. Yeah, okay.

### You (2025-12-02T15:38:08.104Z)

But they're not really moving it forward. And still there are companies like Archer and quite a few other ones that are really using AI not only for the data extraction, but also for the underwriting. So when they shut down rediq, a large number of us were looking for other opportunities. And, you know, I've been in touch with Diane off and on over the couple years that transpired. But that's kind of what brought us together here is because, you know, underwriting is underwriting. It's all math, and, you know, it's. It's basically the same. There's our unique situations to each asset class. But, you know, that's what we are working on right now is to put together a valuation model that is way more automated than what we had at rediq. But, you know, it's also very unique. There is no type of valuation model in the hotel space, which, you know, when Diane told me that I was like, yeah, right. Can't be. But then I've come to learn that it's true. A lot of asset management, a lot of revenue management, a lot of operational type of tools, but I have yet to find anything in the hotel space that is valuation based. So I think we've got ourselves a wide open market here. And hopefully we'll be able to fill that niche.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:39:39.560Z)

That's great. Yeah. I'll make so much sense. And I actually know Coleman here in Charlotte. Who? VP of Sales. Or his exact title. So no Rediq? A little bit. And I'm sure. I don't know if you're pleased or not, but data warehouses are having their return to vogue, so to speak, with how organizations are thinking about AI, whereas everything has gotten so specialized. But now the data lake, the data warehouse, is very much like how a lot of orgs are thinking about it.

### You (2025-12-02T15:39:46.904Z)

Oh, yeah. Okay. Y. Eah. Yeah. Yeah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:40:13.320Z)

So it's all very cool.

### You (2025-12-02T15:40:13.384Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:40:16.440Z)

And so Howard our chief product manager. And I'll just say this before Mike, I turn it over to you. When I first envisioned this, I didn't understand what a product manager was. But now, a year later, there's no way we could have done what we did without having a product manager. I see the value in it every day. What Howard does, he literally writes a description for the software engineers of what they need to build, right? And he, in his mind, he envisions it and he creates it, a no code environment. And then he writes basically technical instructions for the software engineering team to follow. And if it weren't for that. It could be a giant mess. Right? The software. And I have a huge respect for the software engineers, too. Right. Like, that is something. I'm a business person. I could never have done that. But it's proven to me just the product management piece is a critical piece to solving these kind of technical solutions for a sector. And so as we think about the sector, we feel good about where we're going with the underwriting. But AI is good at math as well. Right. And so even something so well intended as our core underwriting model. I mean, AI can do the math as well. So now we're starting to think, okay, what other modules do we build to make the AI the underwriting piece stickier? Right, to make our platform stickier and more helpful to our customers. Very customer centric. And run hotel renovations. Is just a massive sore point. Right? It's manual. It's been manual forever. It's complicated. It's part of every single deal. It needs to be tracked among so many different Personas. Just like the underwriting, the owners, the lenders. Right. The appraisers, like the Berends the management companies. And so this is where just your experience, and I know you didn't have a great experience with Rabbit and Taylor Bird, but you still had experiences and learned a lot from those platforms. And so part of why keeping you and our friend's sphere and chatting with you is important to us. Kind of the details that Diane's given you, but, yeah, just quick and dirty on my background. So construction pm. So was on the other side. Of the industry for close to a decade and working in hospitality. So, as Diane mentioned, with my dad, he ran an owner's rep PM shop. So predominantly Oxford was a big client of ours. So a lot of very large class A institutional grade assets throughout Chicago, in the Midwest. And that was where I was doing a lot of the draw and financial work. And so all this very manual, highly Excel based financial workflows, so eventually was discovered by Rabbit. And so this is. I don't know how much you know about Rabbit, but a tool that was built specifically for all of those budget workflows. Asset agnostic. So yeah, ended up then joining them on the sales team and was basically tasked with finding people who had the same problems as me with handling all of those workflows, change orders. We worked on both the lender and the developer side of that. So that was my introduction into VC backed, purpose built SaaS and technology. And so, yeah, so that was definitely a crash course. And then being on from a practitioner to the purveyor of technology side of things. So that shift occurred and then tailored is the group I worked with after Rabbit and so multifamily focused. And they are a capex and like acquisitions facilitator. So very interesting technology that can model entire buildings. With just a rent roll and an address. And so this the CEO there, Tim, basically kind of went down the NMHC top 50 and was like, hey, if you have this many units on your portfolio, this is a tool that is potentially going to accelerate your acquisitions, save you money and the capex side, prepare you for dispositions. Et cetera. So very interesting tool. They've had a little bit of trouble. For sure narrative of they are helping. I don't want to say moatless or it's one of those molded products that requires storytelling and some just a little bit of work in terms of generating value. But yeah, that has certainly informed the renovation side of the equation for me and too. So I'm sure I dealt with a lot of the same folks sold into or talked to different sides of deals with a lot of.

### You (2025-12-02T15:45:39.144Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:45:43.960Z)

What, about eight months ago? Nine. Something like that. Right around the start of the summer and now started my own outsourced accounting fractional CFO shop. So specifically all of us that I mentioned at Rabbit, there would be groups that, hey, we love this platform, but we don't have the manpower to do an accounting side, corporate accounting side, the project accounting side. Like, okay. Installed itself as, like, a core piece of everyone's workflow. This is an opportunity for me to function as an expert or a consultant across the entire lifecycle or the movement of money through a real estate business. So I've been now started, I've got to kind of serious bookkeeping gigs and then. I'm doing some tech consulting for some of these old clients that I had talked to in days, working directly with them in a Rabbit, for example. And so you also, if you still have it. I'm not sure. I mean, I know you kind of got burned on the whole SaaS sales, right? And felt like that was not something you necessarily wanted to do, and you felt like having something that was, like, stickier to clients was important, I. E. The consulting idea. That you've had around, like, tech stacks and things. Am I getting that correct on. Yeah, I think it's probably a good question for Howard, too, like, knowing, like, how you know, you. How much you've seen technology evolve in the space and prop tech in particular. I just feel like, yeah, the transformation that's occurred kind of underneath everybody's feet over the past two years is something that's, like, disruptive enough where, you know, the older models are. I don't know how well suited they are, you know, for this moment. And so traditional SaaS products, you know. Rabbit, Taylor. Bert's a little bit different because it is pretty unique. I mean, if like, a Google wanted to come in and, you know, do something, a similar mapping, like, yeah, like, Taylor would be blown out of the water. But like a rabbit, where it's just like. It is a relational database. It has, you know. Automations and workflows that were very neat to have created when the technology that was available to create them was in place. So my personal like philosophy has been business owners, particularly in real estate, are still concerned with outcomes. They need experts to be guiding them to those outcomes and the technology that is used to get them there. They're less, you know, concerned with. They know there could be tools like AI that they're using themselves. But ultimately, it's like, as a concierge, as a liaison, as. I just feel like, just like the resurgence of data warehousing, the resurgence of bespoke consulting. Is kind of. That's a personal, you know, guess or bet of mine. In its return and at the detriment of traditional hockey stick, VC backed, you know, SaaS, sales, et cetera. And one of the things is that I know you're. Cause you cross now you're kind of moved into multifamily. Right. And multifamily is a much bigger sector than hospitality. But just to kind of close the loop is hospitality is interesting because it's a smaller. It's still a very big sector, but it's smaller. Everyone knows each other. And so the. I mean, this is my take on it. The potential to build a client stable of, call it 10 to 20 investment companies and hospitality that need bespoke advisory work on tech stacks. It could be an easier infiltration, if that's the right word, or an easier sale, because everyone knows each other. And, I mean, I can literally look at Juniper Square and the distribution podcast that they do. Right? And in the past 90 days, you've had Mitch off from Noble, you have had Greg Freeman from Peachtree. You have had. Eric's last name is totally escaping me. Which you shouldn't. But from ksl you have had the Trinity guys on there. So you already have like four or five. True. And Carlos reduce junior from Driftwood. Right. Who is our anchor safe node investor and we have customer, investor advisor relationship with. Them. So right there you have five hotel investors that use Juniper Square. Right. And yet they're probably struggling with Yard mri Real Page. If you look at peer review, there's no hotel equivalent to Pair View. Right. And Peer View is having some success in that investment management space. And so I just think it could be. A unique, small relational industry that you could have. This is my take again on it. Great success in trying to play out that advisory vision of yours. Yeah, absolutely. And then just, yeah. What the appetite is for buying software. With both Taylor Bird more hands on and more white glove than Rabbit is or was. But the idea of just like, hey, here's a set it and forget it tool that we're going to hand off to you and your team and that you're going to be the ones that use it and that you're going to be the ones who pay us anywhere from 20 to $100,000 a year or whatever that contract is set up. I just don't know how much of an appetite there's going to be for that, particularly when groups are large enough. It's like, hey, do you have an analyst? That knows N8N is this something that we can be either building or buy it? I feel like SaaS was always positioned really well. It's like groups are going to try to build it and they'll come back to buy it. And now the build it potential is just. Yeah, the power at everyone's fingertips is just unlike anything we've had before. And just how that bust up some of these traditional models. We're so good to see that shake out.

### You (2025-12-02T15:52:14.424Z)

I agree. That there's definitely an opportunity there. You know, there's always been. Real page. Mri, Yardy. All of the companies who try to be everything to their buddy, right? But it really boils down. Jack of all trades, master of none. Their products are mediocre. So I have seen a lot of new startups over the last few years in the multifamily competing against Real Page and Yardy. A couple, you know, some of them are more open source. They are focused more on AI. I think real estate in general. Hospitality definitely there, and even multifamily. Are behind pretty much every other industry, you know, when it comes to technology. Multifamily is getting better. Right. You know, if there's ever a silver lining to Covid, you know, that was one of them. It just really forced them to take a look at some of the other alternatives out there. But there's still pushback. But, you know, one thing that I have seen is, especially when it comes to, you know, like, smart technology. Thermostats, lighting, keyless entry, you know, all of those things. There's a lot of different companies out there. That are offering those types of products, and a lot of. The management companies and owners, you know, they just don't know where to start. So I think, you know, the, the idea of having some type of an advisory. And then also being able to tie them together. Right. If you talk Nate into somebody, they're going to just like, what? And what seems relatively simple and straightforward. You know, a tool like. Like that and others would just, you know, blow most of those people away. They just wouldn't understand it. So, yeah, I think if you could put things together in very simple terms and come up with a way to still tie a lot of those together because. It's still very fragmented, right? There's a lot.

### Guest (2025-12-02T15:54:37.480Z)

And when we say hotel has no technology, in fairness, the hotel operation space has tons of technology. And someday, maybe in the next week or two, I'd love to walk you guys through what profit sort is doing and how it's built, because it's $83 million in ARR and it's just very interesting. It's called. It's actually called actable now. But they're core product is called Profit Sword. But they are at 83 million in ARR. I know that for sure. Right. And they're probably close to what would be described as unicorn status. But that's on the operation side. What doesn't exist at all is anything for hotel real estate investment. Right. And Mike and Howard, I mean, we've all been on the real estate side. So renovations is a real estate thing that gets done, right? I mean, yes, it impacts operations considerably because you have to plan around. There's a lot involved with it, but. There are just zero solutions right now out there. And I describe it like this, and I may be naive. But it's the biggest blue ocean opportunity I've ever seen in my entire career. And there are people going at it, but they're all going at it from the very same narrow perspective of enter through hotel investment, asset management. And I think that these companies, the leaders are deal guys. They're deal junkies. And so they're happy to have an analyst. They could care less. But when it comes to winning deals and moving faster on deals, and if capital and capital projects is part of that. Right, because it's such a manual process. Then it would get their interest. Which is why, again, we're really focused at coming at the deal side in. Right from the moment the deal happened, from the moment a seller thinks I'm going to sell an asset. Follow that workflow stream and just it's incredible that the same data, which is Financial Star Report offer ending memorandum and then the capex workflow that's created from that. Right. The brand says, okay, change of ownership. Here's our chance to do a product improvement plan, a pip, right? They pip it and the manual God awful process that's involved with that. If that can get automated, then the deal guys who run the companies I think would be interested in the product and that differentiates us from the groups that are going at it from I'm just going to go and try to serve the asset management community because I've spent 15 years in asset management, and I'm sorry to say, but it's like a B player inside of these companies. The A players are the deal guys that run the shops. And so that's kind of in our vision and our orientation of the product. That's how we're differentiating ourselves right now. But, Mike, I know what we're doing might not necessarily be what you want to do, but again, I just feel like they're like, if you put the three of us in, like, even on a call today, like, we could be your third opportunity for our fractional CFO role. Right. That would potentially generate some revenue for you. I don't want to say immediately, because I don't think we could do it like this month or in January, but pretty quickly could probably generate some revenue for you. I wanted to bring up this idea that I've been working on. Mike, like you, you're a fantastic networker there. Is a woman in the hotel industry named Andrea Foster. And Andrea Foster is probably the best networker I've ever met in the hotel industry. She's currently at a company called Mind Click, a huge role like departure for her. The Mind Click is a company owned by a woman. Her first name is Joanna. I'M forgetting Abrams is her last name. And they are in the business of sustainability, so they're tracking sustainable product that goes into hotel renovations. They have spent the last. Or Joanna, who's a tech investor herself, she and her husband are tech investors, has spent the last 15 years creating very strong and sticky relationships with the brand ANC departments. Right. So the groups that issue the pips, and that again, is because they're tracking sustainable renovation products. Right. And trying to kind of create a narrative or a monetizable product and technology around that. But why they could be a really interesting partner is they already have the relationships with the Berends right? And they're already tracking renovations. So you start to marry that with a skill set like Mike, what you can bring to the table. Maybe. I mean, maybe it's an advisory, you know, role to. To bring you some income. Maybe it's something you would want to do long term as part of, like, you know, your vision of how. Of how your career unfolds. But you now have two things that combine together could leapfrog us. You know, take literally, you know, two years off the development of creating a product that helps track hotel renovations. And then the third piece is. I love and I know Howard hearing it for the first time, the idea of an advisory practice that is separate but kind of linked. Right. Because the advisory practice would be using the. Data warehouse that we're creating through our SaaS platform, but would really be focused on, you know, those hotel investors that. There's one hotel, there's maybe two hotel investors, Host and Driftwood, that have committed substantial internal resources towards technology, but most can't really. I mean, it's a. It's a lot of investment and then who's leading it and where is it going and how do you like? I think it's a complicated thing for many hotel investors that just are out there wanting to do good hotel investments. Right. But AI has created this almost like demand that you have to figure this out at this moment in time. So I. It could be a really great way to build that advisory practice you have in your. In your mind, but potentially focused on hospitality. And then I'll go back to my gosh, your dad is almost like a perfect. Just to pull him into this because he's a practitioner like you. Are. Right. And so, like, even just having access to both of you to talk about. All right, this is the work. This is the workflow of a hotel renovation would be invaluable to us as we start to think about the second module to invest. So, I'm sorry I rambled there, but I want to really like. Like, I mean, like, there's so much, like so many great irons in the fire at the moment, and. And that's where I think from, like. Yeah. Not knowing how. How much of you know, this is occupying on each of your guys day to day. How you would kind of Berkadia, like the priorities for the business, you know, at the moment, then of obviously we have the first safe note, which is fantastic, like pitching investors and like, okay, hey, we have this mvp, you know, come, we'll. We'll show you what we need to so far. But, like, come along. This journey, you know, with us, and then to the actual use cases on, you know, the underwriting side, the valuation side, knowing that the renovation side is. Is something that's in development. That. Yeah. That may couple or you know, how the business model, whether it's just strictly selling the platform itself, whether there is like a, you know, consulting piece, you know, alongside of it, just. I guess. Yeah. How you're thinking about like here, here are the, the dominoes that we, that we want. So let me jump in there because it was something that Howard and I are spending a lot of time on right now. And quite frankly, we're. We're kind of taking a step back because two of our partners are departing. We started with five partners, and it was just too too many, and. And we could not reach agreement on. Certain things that. That slowed us down. So this is a very good thing. It's giving us the opportunity to take a step back and rethink what we want to do. But Domino's right. Step one, we have our first anchor safe node investor for $75,000. That it is a safe note. There is a pre money valuation. So it's. It's a bit smoke and mirrors, to be honest, because I'm spending some time consulting with them as well, but I'm consulting on their technology. Initiatives. Right. So why that helps us is, I mean, literally, after this call, I. I hope to find some time with Howard this week that I can show him what they're building internally, because there's a giant gaping hole around the valuation piece and their technology stack that they're building internally. Right. And they also do tons of new build and renovations. And I think they said I might be so stupid and saying this, but that they use North Spree. Mike, is that a platform that is used in construction or spree? Nor spire. Nor spire. Yes. More splur. We have one direct competitor, Rabbit. So if they're doing that for, like, draws and budgets. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Okay, so Now Domino's is that 75, 000. That doesn't really cover a whole lot. Right. And we need to go out and. Raise another three to five safe notes. Probably in. In Q1. Told in. Maybe this rolls into Q2. Total amount. I'll call it around. For $500,000. That gives us the ability to pay Howard, pay our chief Technology officer. Bring someone like you in, right. To help us, and then we put our heads down. And we go find the. And maybe the safe node investors are actually other. Other CIA's, like driftwood, right? Other companies. Because this is. When you look at a company. Howard gets tired of me talking about Elise AI. But I just follow because it's not really along what we're doing, right? It's. A very different type of company. But in multifamily, what they did is they went after their MVPs. They went after customers. Right. And the customers were their early investors. And so that's what I would see us trying to do. In addition, with some friends and family capital, Then we just put our heads down and we quietly finish out the underwriting module, which is getting a rebrand, because the term AVM is. Is conjuring up thoughts of ARGUS for people. Right. It's not a good brand, and so we need to rebrand it something more along the lines of, like, augmented underwriting or something like that. And Howard is very I mean, he has really firm ideas on on this. It tells me all the time I need to stop using the word AVM because it's not good for us. But then we sit down and see if Mind Click would consider a partnership with us on the capex side. And just like I started with Howard, we just lay the groundwork, right? And that will take us 12 months. But in the interim, we're going to need, like, a fractional CFO because we've been running a little too loose with the way we've been doing things, and we need to button it up. Dot eyes and cross tees and do some things. That, again, that's just as a really, you know, lean startup, we haven't been doing. So we have that need for sure. I don't know that that's a full time position. Right. But if you'd be willing to spend some time on the Capex piece as well, you know that that could really lead to something long term for us and then we'd love to talk to you about how to marry then like that. Advisory idea into it, but we do have work to do on raising the three to five additional safe notes or investors that are customers or friends and family. I really believe I can do this because there's. Well, for a few reasons. One, I've done hotel investing my entire career, so I know a lot of people the women's network is incredibly strong within the hotel industry. And so that alone I think I can leverage into investments, plus strategic relationships, like something with Joanna Abrams. Right. I think I can leverage into fundraising opportunities for us. And we have another woman, her name is Jessica Kramer. That we're talking to you that she's really been on the tech side, on the, like, more of the hotel revenue, like the operations revenue side. But she has tremendous relationships as well. So I. I mean, I have to go do it. But I believe that if I can get driftwood, I can get the others. Right. And then proof in the pudding. Yeah, absolutely. And. I guess. Yeah. Knowing then with like customer centric investors like that. These are your safe, no targets. We need, you know, this kind of funding to build what we want to build. In those, like, five to 10 meetings that the women's network might help set you set up. Like, you know, however you're going to get in front of those people. I guess what has you most sure that like, like they're going to be potentially cutting a check, you know, within a few rounds of meetings. And then what has you feeling like, okay, hey, I would be worried that we're not ready. They're not ready because of X. So it's just the lack of solutions. And I realize that people, everyone right now thinks that they can use AI in house, and they can. And they can to a certain degree. And this is why our core underwriting product, while I felt, like, so good about it two years ago, what AI does really, really well is math, right? The simplicity of math. But the data, the data extraction and organizing the data is something that we need to deliver on. Well, like, almost like perfect, you know? Like right now, our work on data extraction from hotel PNLs and PDF and Excel format were over 90% accuracy on annual PNLs from data extraction perspective, and we want to be above 95%. But we're also confidentially talking to Mark Woodworth about trying to revive Benchmarker and see if there's an opportunity there. So why do I think is that everyone feels the pain of these manual processes and understands that there's there has to be a solution going forward, right? So if I could get ksl, if I could get Noble, I do believe I can get Peachtree, for what it's worth, because I'VE had conversations with Brian Waldman specifically about this. He's their chief investment officer. And so I like their next target for us. Now, the second question is what could go wrong is we have been shaken up by these two partners leaving. It's the very best thing for us because I learned a lot through this. And that is 20. 20. 2020. Splits five ways doesn't really work, and it doesn't present well. So we need to reorganize ourselves and we need to. I think, get past a little bit of the shakeup that has happened for us with these two partners leaving and kind of get back to building the product and feeling really good about the product instead of the infighting that we've had about, do we bootstrap, do we raise money right, like that core thing? We could not get past. And so once we get past that, and I think the excitement and the feeling good about it resumes for the people on our team, I think that will really help us move this forward as well. So did I answer that question, Mike? Yeah, well, exactly. I'm just trying to picture that meeting. Diane of just like. Yeah, you've got these five to ten meetings lined up. And then, because I have no doubt your ability to go in and speak to the pain, speak to the vision of what InnVestAI is going to solve for these groups, and then just not knowing yet what the specific objections would be. So if they were really scrutinizing the company's composition, for example, so if it's just like, okay, hey, this is too many co founders for us. Or if it's like, we don't have a product that we can see yet, that we can walk with you on that vision so far. Or if it's because I'm just imagining like, okay, so yes, the co founder piece of it, definitely, and that's getting cleaned up. But the underwriting product, we actually do have an mvp like our real MVP that is shippable within weeks. Our problem wise. And this was part of the founder issue. Is two of our founders wanted the perfect mvp, right? And their view was you only have one time to make a first impression, and this needs to be perfect. Whereas I think we believe that the better solution is try to get in with, like, again, this customer investor advisor relationship, and let's send them the very imperfect mvp. Right? And we're just going to start to iterate ruthlessly on it, right. With their real feedback. And so I can even look at Driftwood and say when I look at what they've built from a technology perspective, internally, what they're missing is the underwriting piece of it, which we could bring. Right. And we could test it throughout. They have a debt and structured finance team, so they're lending. They're an investor, they're a management company. They have to do internal valuations like. Like the testing ground is just huge for us within their company, so. And we have the MVP that we can literally send, plus really good accuracy on data extraction. We think we can iterate more on that with a. In a partnership. With Mark Woodworth, but we're an early exploration on that idea and trying. And trying to figure that out. Does it. Does that help? I mean, I don't know. Yeah. Because to me, in my mind, I'm picturing, like, yourself and Howard and Pitch Deck, you know, of just like, hey, this is this. Is this problem space. This is, you know, where we think we can go. This is what we've already built, like, come along, you know, with us at the tune to the tune of a 75k to 100k, you know, safe. Note that I'm just trying to imagine, like, yeah, what would be someone's. Hesitation or reservation. It's just like, oh, we might be able to build this in house. Oh, we might. You know, like, where that is because. Or just if you feel, like, internally like we're not ready for that pitch in school or. Yeah. Well, I think part of it is these. I'll call them informational interviews, but it's real client feedback. I have a friend. You may know her because, again, we all know each other. Stacy. Now. Done. She ran the HVS practice in Chicago for many, many years. She's an appraiser, and she's now Western Alliance Bank. And so one of the things we believe is that this product is better launched in the lending space because lending is a very high level underwriting and it has to go very, very quickly. Right. And so this idea, we automatically populate the data with all the historicals and, you know, full year reforcast and the Star Report. We've just saved you a ton of time. So Stacy loved that idea. We sat with her and talked with her at length about two weeks ago about it. She said, our pain point is the data, the data manipulation, the data transfer. But where we were potentially going down the wrong path on our as we were thinking about it, and this might not be true of every lender, but I guess it's true of Western Alliance. And this is something we really needed to understand before. We just launched with the perfect MVP is they use a Moody's platform already. Firm wide. Right. And they're not getting rid of that Moody's platform. That Moody's platform is what tracks the LTVs, the covenants, the debt service coverage ratios, like all of that. Right. So while we were thinking we should build out that functionality, and honestly, we still will, they are already have a product. That serves that for them, right. What they don't have is the data extraction piece, and that's where the pain is. If we were to do something with that, just because they're so big, they're a bank. I mean, we might have to go in and white label or do something along those lines for them, but it would still give us the opportunity to build the product and iterate. Right? And iterate and iterate and. Iterate. Now that's just Western Alliance Bank. They are very big bank. Let me talk about a group like Peachtree Group. They're a private lender, right? So it's a very. It's different. They don't have the same regulations that they're working with. They may already be using the Moody's tool that Western alliance is using, but I think because they're a management company, they're a developer, they're an investor, they're a lender. Like, if we were to go in and if I could convince Brian to say, hey, Brian, look, we need $150,000 to get us from where we are to, like, you know, I don't know, like, an actual. From the MVP to a version one. Right. And we think it's going to take us. Six months. Work with us, come be an investor and InnVestAI just like Driftwood and help us iterate the product, build the product you need. Right. So it's just like the Elise AI thing so we work with them. Brian's feedback was probably what initiated our thoughts on the Devonstructure finance because when I first talked to him, he said the best place for us to talk about this is in our debt platform because it's a high level underwriting and it moves really fast. Right. And it's all so manual, even once they lend. Right. And they actually issue the proceeds. And then you know this because of all the work you've done with Rabbit Rabbit. But the tracking, right, That's a very manual process. Even just something as simple as sending the financial statements. It is. The steps that are happening is so ridiculous at this point in. In. In our industries existence that it can be streamlined. Pretty immediately. So if we could get Peachtree, if we could get one or two other CIA type investors, plus a couple of friends and family, I think we have enough to get us to the point where we're iterating and creating a product with real customer feedback. Not and this is what the challenge we had with the two investors that we parted with. They felt like they knew what the customers needed. Right. But the reality is, yes, we've all been around investments, but I haven't been a lender working at Western Alliance Bank. Right. I'm an investment person myself, so I don't exactly understand what exact product Is this making sense? So we need that real time customer feedback, just like Mina Song got when she built Elise AI. She was constant customer feedback loops. And if we do that and then, and I believe if we then start to build this renovation vertical that just ties with it, that the pain points and renovation are so severe in. Hospitality, and they cross so many different Persona profiles that we could then have a stickier product. And, you know, then what I hope is we become less like a commoditized SaaS platform. And we, we essentially have a technology solution and we are technically SaaS, right? But we're building it in this bespoke industry, this industry that's so relationship driven, Right. And then we marry the consulting idea to it and have something that can scale, could potentially scale to the size of where actable is. Right now, it's just really focused on investment. So I'm sorry I rambled, but I'm trying to explain. Like the dominoes. Right, Domino. The next thing is call Brian Waldman or reach out to Brian Waldman, you know, after the first of the year, because at this point, we're almost at Christmas and people are gonna shut down. Say, let us do a demo for you for your debt group, right? And let us talk about this. Would you be interested in 100, 150k safe now, where we come in and we try to create the solutions for you, right? And then we start to build out at the same time we start to lay the groundwork on the Capex piece, which is what I did on the underwriting piece just years ago. Right. It took me years to get to the point where Howard and I are working together and have built this underwriting tool. So I need to lay the groundwork on the Capex tool. And it will take. It'll take time. Yeah. Howard, any thoughts from you or. Yeah, no, George, obviously the internal perspective is going to be varied and we know some co founders had some different views as well. Because I can just say from where my advantage is of the one, the first domino to be flicking of like, if you want customer feedback to sell to like, we have a solution for underwriting. It's like, in the product. Might not be ready for that, but like, to say, hey, pay us $150,000 in this particular pain point, we will solve for you. And that, like, well, you're solving it or not solving it. Like, there will be feedback, you know, inevitably. In that. So I'm just wondering if there is cause, knowing that renovations sounds less built out than underwriting and the valuation side right now, if there is something on either the lending side, on the investment side that you can say, hey, we can sell to this right now. And here is the money we're asking for. Here's the partnership expectations we have with this because, yeah, I guess fishing around for it, that Domino does exist. Or not.

### You (2025-12-02T16:21:37.544Z)

Not yet. In all honesty, we. We do have the majority of the lender module built out. There were still some things that we need to add. And, and this is kind of more from the servicing side. So the, the initial idea was for the lender to be able to input, you know, what is the debt coverage ratio? What is the, you know, the, the yield. Along with some other things. So from the valuation standpoint, you know, they don't typically use, you know, a going in cap rate. So, you know, we will input the discount rate, which, you know, we've already got the math, everything's there. We just need to put it together so that we can get it. In front. Of an actual tester. And go from there. Like I said, we're very close. So it's the. The proof of concept that I put together. I think Diane mentioned it earlier. I just used some off the shelf, no code, like lovable. Few other things. And it is a functioning poc, but it's not geared towards any one specific user. Right. So, you know, it's got a lot of the equity side, so you can input your partnerships and, you know, the percentage of who's putting in what. All of your acquisition assumptions. What? You're going in, cap rate, et cetera. And then even on the lending side, right, we've, we, we can add those metrics. There's not a lot of difference in how it works, the differences on what metrics they're looking at, right? A lender is not going to be concerned with cash on cash, iir, et cetera. So it's. We're. We're not as far as. As what it sounds like we are. We. We were.

### Guest (2025-12-02T16:23:37.080Z)

But one thing to go back to is that we took a hotel underwriting model in Excel, right? And we wanted the SaaS to feel like almost exactly like Excel. And so, Howard, I mean, that part we've created, right?

### You (2025-12-02T16:23:50.984Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-12-02T16:23:53.480Z)

So the way that hotels are underwritten, which is you do a penetration analysis on occupancy, ADR and RevPAR, that's all built just like it looks in Excel in an actual SaaS format. We have built out all of the pors and pars and the drivers that you do to create hotel pro forma. That's all been built out so it exists. It feels like an Excel model, albeit in SaaS platform. A lot of pushback, which I don't think is surprising. It's like I can't let go of my Excel model. I can't let go of my Excel model. Like my Excel model is the end all be all right. So that feedback we're getting that from people. But it was our intent to create a product that they didn't have to learn. A new way of underwriting. It's the exact same way we've underwritten for 40 years. And the hotel space, it's just what it does is it automatically can load all of those historicals, the star report, the annual forecast, so you don't have to do that. And as updates come out, it can update those as well. So no more a new month is this a financial is issued. You've got to copy and paste and recalc the trailing 12. That all gets done in the model, but it's a generic model at this point. We kind of build it more thinking up along the lines of acquisitions. And what it doesn't do is have the UI that a lender would require. That said, we really do need to work with some lenders to understand what the UI that they require really looks like. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I guess, yeah, there's just the classic chicken or egg, you know, dilemma of, like, if you have those partnerships to build alongside of you or, you know, people paying, you know, whether it's like, okay, hey, you have this investment component as part of our deal, but also you're paying for these results. Or outcomes in the form of, you know, this many deals underwritten, you know, this many valuations, like whatever that metric is, and you're that deliverable at a highly discounted rate relative to where that is. So say, like, eventually InnVestAI is charging, you know, $100,000, you know, for access to the platform for a group like, you know. Driftwood. Yeah. Peachtree for the year. You're getting that for 20,000 and, you know, and whether there's that investment side that's coming along with it. That like, yes, you also have a safe note here to actually be paying for the product itself. And even though the product isn't, you know, up to snuff, Yet. It's like that you're co creating it for your tightening the loop of the chicken or the egg, you know, so there's ways to be thinking about that because, yeah, the idea that someone is just going to just come alongside and like, hey, we'll, we'll just offer really thoughtful comments. Without, like the. The work earned in the trenches of having used it. Because, like that, that's just where the most honest criticism is going to come from. The most honest blockages. Like the true definition of those dominoes. It exists, but then it's just like. Then you're. Then it's. It's. You. It's. It's your gusto in a pitch deck that's going to, you know, get you to that. You know, I mean, maybe there's some MVP that they'd want to see, but it's just like, hey, we trust Diane, we trust Howard, that they will get, you know. To this point to delivering this. Versus like, hey, we have something that we're actually touching, feeling, playing with, and it's contributing to our business, you know, day one. Like a great outcome would be with your I'll just use your food since they are current safe note investor right is is over the next three months we start testing the underwriting platform in their debt platform with their internal valuations with their investment team and then ultimately with the management company. But the management company is the most detailed underwriting. Right. It. It is the most, you know, it gets into the most granular level. But if by. I mean, I know March 31st is perhaps too optimistic. So let's just say by June 30th, we could say we have tested InnVestAI on, you know, 2,000 hotel deals. Right? And that is X amount of debt deals, X amount that they have. They own 50 hotels and they're doing quarterly valuations, right? So that we've tested it on, you know, now twice on quarterly valuations. We've taught and we can actually show that we've run. What did you call it? But we've like, we've actually like, test, like, we've done that kind of real world testing with the product through this customer investor advisor relationship. That would be a huge win for us because the feedback we would be getting would be phenomenal and we would start to be able to show, look at how much. We've already used it. Right. Right. For someone and be able to state stats versus just vision. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and. And there's. It's just like, yeah, that cost. Right. And there's a cost to acquiring the ability to do that. So it's either, like, your time to persuade, you know, somebody that, like, hey, give us, you know, your data. We'll work alongside you in a way. That isn't going to guarantee any results or, hey, well, this would normally be priced at, you know, we will be working, you know, for these three months to make sure that you do have those results, like, come hell or high water, you know, at a rate of, you know, 80%, you know, discount, you know, whatever that. Is like of buying those, you know, initial clients and that that ability to have put the sausage through the sausage, you know, maker know them, that that is what is actually needed to deliver on that, you know, that next pitch to that next group. But I guess my impression though is like before, like over committing to the product side. Is like. Like, if there has there been struggles on the vision pitch, like, is it just because of the distractibility, you know, of some of these groups, the potential of AI? Because to me, it's just like the problem space that you're speaking to of, like, we're strictly talking about an investment level there. Is no guarantee on, you know, this coming back like this is exactly how we intend on going to do this, you know, to build this product in this way. Is there just apprehension on that? Because I imagine, like, with, you know, your expertise with the team, you know, that has been assembled around this, that, like, to keep a really. Tight, compelling pitch on that. Like, even if it's getting to a few no's fast that I don't see, you know, 75 to $100,000 for this, this pain ecosystem that is existing for some of these groups being something that they would, you know, necessarily be really reluctant about, it's. It's, it's, it seems like that, that might, you know, with the right meetings and the right, and the right pitch, it's just like, yeah, that's, well, I can't. That's what I believe. Me. DIANE Fox. That's what I believe. But where we ran into challenges is one of our. The co founder that laughed. He did not want to raise capital. He was very, very focused on dilution. Right. And partly because we only each had 20% share, because it was split five ways. He really wanted to bootstrap this as far as he possibly could. But what that did was it create burnout. Because everyone's working for free, and we can't all work for free indefinitely, right? And this particular investor is an affluent former broker. The reason I even reached out to him was because he was a former broker. And so he lives in these Haber worlds, right, that we're trying to penetrate. But he wanted the perfect MVP and he essentially didn't want to raise any capital. And so while we never had a. I would say we should have. And this is on my failure as a leader, I should have addressed that head on sooner because I just let it go and I let it go and I let it go to the point where it exhausted us, Right. And then it ended up blowing up. And so when I say we haven't really been out in front of any of those groups because of that reluctance from him, like, he was almost gatekeeping some of that from us. And I have those relationships as well, but I was trying to work in collaboration, right? So I didn't really. I was trying to work in collaboration with him, and now that he's not involved with it, I feel like I'm now free to be able to go have some of those conversations that I couldn't with him in the. With him and the. Role. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. And different. Yeah. Different perspectives on, on how to pursue, you know, how to build the business and then how to pursue the business that will keep the business sustained. Yeah. Because I guess if, if you had the data points to say no, like, I've gone in with, like, my tightest My best, like, you know, to some of these groups, and they're just like, we need an mvp. Like, we, we. We're not trusting this until we see exactly how our data is going to be presented to us. Because, I mean, just from a sales perspective, Like, the amount of. It's like demoing Rabbit. It's like there's going to be some. You know, the accountants are going to want to know every click, but that's. That's not what wins the day. Like, it's like being in the product itself and. And clicking around to give. Them as much visual reassurance as that's not a good place for a deal. It's just like either a group is going to come in and trust that you're able to deliver on those outcomes. And the problem is that if certain groups can't yet, like, that's the chicken or egg dilemma. It's like, well, we don't know how we would do 2,000 deals, you know, in that way, the platform as built could eventually, you know, deliver on that, but. Yeah. As far as, like, a domino that is just, like, most winnable, most available to you, you, your expertise, the team you've assembled. Howard, like, coming in and saying, hey, this is exactly where a background is. This is exactly what we're building. We need an investment of this amount in order to do this. Are you on board with us, you know, or not? And it's like. And to have, you know, the MVP in the background, to be able to show, here's what we built so far like that, to me, that conversation seems like the least amount of friction and, like, the data that you'll get to know, like, groups saying, no, hey, we're not willing to commit that way, or we need to see the product. This, like, you know, have this feature, you know, the, the testability will come in a lot of those pitches, you know, too, of like, why a group is or isn't ready to commit to a dollar amount, like, that.

### You (2025-12-02T16:34:22.504Z)

Yeah. Agree.

### Guest (2025-12-02T16:34:27.560Z)

So just to close on that, we do have an mvp, but again, it's not the perfect mvp. Right, Right. More of a generic underwriting where we essentially recreated hotel underwriting in excel in a SaaS platform. But it's not really specific to an investor or a lender or an appraiser, because like the metric cards and kind of the way each would look at the underwriting isn't quite built out, but the core function of it, which is we're having success extracting the data. We could be entering into a really interesting partnership with Mark Woodward that helps us accelerate, like the data transfer idea. And we've built the actual formula. And this is what Howard is painstakingly done over the past year, Right? He has painstakingly gone into an Excel model, followed every single underwriting formula, written it. Out in instructions and worked with the software engineering team to convert that into a SaaS platform. That's a lot of work that he's done. Like, that amount of work is like. I just. I can't think of anyone else who would have done that amount of work on a hotel underwriting model. So not perfect. Right. And that's where the disagreement came with our former partners is it's not the perfect mvp, but the, you know, the, the core piece of the pors and the pars. And mathematically, the calculations are working. It's just the key metric cards and some of the things that a Lender might need to see. Aren't quite fully developed yet. Does it, does that make sense? Yeah, I mean, it does from, like, the strict usage of, like, set it and forget it software of, like, okay, hey, if we were to walk away from this, and how would they be able to use it? But in these, like, initial early deals, like, you're not just selling the software. You know, you're selling the team that is going to be using that software, helping them understand and communicate the benefits of that software, build that software alongside them. So whether it's like, okay, hey, these 10 deals, like, you're buying this ability for us to underwrite this whatever. That number is to sell that, then knowing that that data is going to come back in to what Howard has built and refine it. And it's like, oh, okay, this lender would really want to see this. It's like, great. We have these three deals to show exactly why, you know, it broke in this. Capacity when we tried to, you know, take it here. Like, that's why we built this new, you know, feature component or polished up the UI in that way. Because. Yeah. Like, if there's, if the software isn't ready to be sold, like, you know, I would have sold. Like, it's just like, hey, it's not yet. It's not running solely, then it's like, yeah, then you're at that, like, investment level conversation that you're not selling. The product, yet you're selling the vision you're selling the outcomes you're selling. And that, like, that can be perfectly. That playbook that's done to do that, you know, could eventually fade away because of how all the work and the people and the relationships and the data and everything brought through from the successful, that successful playbook into then the like we have. Our sausage maker is dialed and we're going in. We're selling the sausage maker itself rather than. Yeah. What? What is going in to build it, so to speak? Yeah, the sausage maker. I get going back to what Stacy now Done. He said it's like the date, like the data process, right? The data processing kind of is some of the sausage making, right. It's. It's taking that pain away from. From someone who's done it my whole life, right? I'M so tired of copy paste. You know, macros, vlookups, hlookups. And ultimately there's always a mistake. I pick up a model that's something got hard coded and I don't remember it. And then there's mistake, and you look foolish in front of whoever you're. Presenting the deal to. So our vision has been like, take that pain away from someone, literally. They get a model that's pre populated with all the historicals. The forecast, right? The star, Right? And then they can start then to speed up. So if it takes them two days to underwrite a hotel investment, could it take it down to one hour? That's, that's what we've been working. And can you do that for them, Diane? Initially, like, can it, can you say, hey, on these 10 deals, you're going to have this pre populated. It's just like, so part of like your initial investment is choose, you know, the 10 projects, the 20 projects, whatever that number is like, we will have all that for you. And then in the background, you are, you know, yes, you're putting it through the product that Howard and company have built so far, but you're using that to polish and refine it. And that, yes, it might eventually get from two days to one hour based on how good that product is. But at that time, it's zero hours for them because they're just handing over the data for you. But it's 10 hours of your time. Like, you know, you're continuing to. You're doing that. We're very close on that. Given the data extraction work that Howard and his team has done paints it. And this has been months and months. Right. Of testing data extract, hotel financial Data extraction from PDFs in Excel files at the annual level. We're not quite at the monthly level yet, but we're at the annual level above a 90% success. Rate below a 95% success rate. And so there's these, like. There are things that pop up. I mean, in generally, I swear to God, it's usually below the GOP line, right? It's usually real estate taxes, insurance. It's. It's those fixed expenses, which is so ironic because part of where our industry falls is those fixed expenses often live in yardy real page mri. Right? And so the property manager can get it down to the GOP line. But they often unless they're sophisticated, some of those fixed expenses are living in a different software platform. Right. And more of an owner investor platform. But it's often those things that are what? And this is my experience and under a trip you up. You got to go back and check. What is this fixed expense in here? I don't understand what it is. What was it for? Was it Cam? Was it. Annually or doing really good. And so. Demonstrate. It's a trial. To get to the point. They would be trial themselves. Know where this is. And you already, I mean. Because I don't want to get in. Worms, integrations, et cetera. Going to always have. Well, it could do this. This is how we solve it. That we can. Software. I just don't know if that's too cumbersome. But Howard talked all day today like I usually do on these calls. I'm so sorry.

We've been going over an awful lot of different things here. I think you know. To summarize what we were talking about earlier. You know, I agree that we need to focus on. Maybe consider it more of a sales or a partnership process than sales process. Right. So we have to get involved in. Current or working side by side with some of these, these products. But honestly, in terms of most of the other things that we've been discussing, you know, I don't really have an opinion yet. You know, I would just kind of want to. See how this all plays out, right? You know, in terms of how we could potentially work together, how. How there's a potential partnership. Is. The product complementary is a. Is it not? I mean, I. I just don't know enough at this time to even know what questions to ask, so. Primarily the Capex, the underwriting, I'm fine with. I, you know, and. And I've been involved with Capex on the multifamily side as an asset manager, renovations, etc. I, I, I have a full understanding of the capex. I just not quite sure, you know, from, from the PIP standpoint, you know, how does this work into with the lender model? I mean, there's a lot of different things that need to be going on and you know, one of the, one of the concerns I have is. Focus. Right. So, you know, I think we've heard a lot of great ideas discussed. I just want to make sure we're not going down a bunch of rabbit holes. Right. So, you know, I. I think the capex is great. The question is, when do we need that? You know, we don't even have the underwriting model out yet, so I think it sits premature to even start thinking about the capex or. Excuse me, Start working on it. I mean, thinking about it. Yeah, exactly. But then again, it comes down to resources. I mean, You know, if we're just talking about a potential partnership and maybe having two separate roadmaps of who's going to do what. That that might make me feel a little bit better, but I'm just. I just am kind of cautious about where we are with. With resources and making sure that we stay focused on what our core is. Before we start going off in a lot of different tangential products. Not today. But. But, yeah, I mean, we. We'd have to work with the team and, and make sure that we've got all the things in place that are prepared so that we can do that. So from a data extraction standpoint, yeah, I feel more comfortable. Very comfortable with that. It's not a hundred percent. It never will be. There's always going to be something that pops up that that's going to throw off an error. But in terms of the actual workflow, I think we're good on that. But we still have to complete, like, the. Setup modal, where they input all of the requirements and everything else that still has a few things that needs to be completed there. In addition, I need to go through and validate all of the formulas and make sure that the. That the team understood exactly what needs to be done. We haven't gotten to that point yet. And don't get me wrong, you know, I think it's a great idea. I mean, it's something that's going to have to be done. I. I don't think. Just the valuation model on its own is sufficient because capex is such a huge part. Whether you're an investor, a broker, lender, I mean, that's. It's like. Incomplete. If we don't have that, it's. It's just a matter of resources and timing, so. Yeah. Appreciate it. Yeah, likewise. Thank you. Good. All right. See ya.
