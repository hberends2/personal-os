### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:10.602Z)

What so what I wanted to

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:10.669Z)

What I wanted to know over because my

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:14.372Z)

go over

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:15.379Z)

saying, I'm saying, hold on.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:16.382Z)

because when Diane started saying all that and then your follow-up, was just like, okay. There's a lot here and it was I would you know, some of it, I think,

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:23.119Z)

I think, like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:25.712Z)

like, generally, it was all correct, but it was it was, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:25.969Z)

generally, safe with like, not I don't think

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:30.292Z)

I think not

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:31.309Z)

what

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:31.422Z)

don't think it was it wasn't clear to me that we are moving in quite the right direction.

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:31.889Z)

quite the right direction. Yeah. It's been quite the center.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:35.222Z)

We're we're, like, maybe slightly off center.

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:36.919Z)

So let me go back.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:39.092Z)

So

### You (2025-06-02T21:02:39.609Z)

To

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:02:40.572Z)

let me go back to the where's the I wanna where's the chat that we were looking at earlier? K.

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:05.399Z)

Alright. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:07.672Z)

Alright. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:12.819Z)

so I guess

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:15.372Z)

I'll start with, I guess, this.

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:16.219Z)

this.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:30.262Z)

Basically, what she's like, outlining here are

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:33.509Z)

Revenue

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:34.212Z)

each of the main revenue and expense areas, rooms,

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:34.869Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:37.802Z)

food, beverage, art. Right? And and she's giving

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:37.809Z)

You know, some of them. Are usual

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:40.072Z)

you know, some of them are

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:41.259Z)

projected on the direct amount basis.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:42.362Z)

usually projected on either an amount basis. A POR, PAR, whatever it is. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:46.219Z)

I'm from a

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:48.582Z)

I'm from a

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:49.679Z)

and I'm seeing from a development standpoint,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:50.802Z)

consistency and I'm assuming from a development standpoint,

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:53.249Z)

I think if you develop a mechanism by which a user can select

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:03:55.422Z)

I think if you develop a mechanism by which a user can select

### You (2025-06-02T21:03:57.819Z)

I wanna project

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:00.052Z)

I wanna project

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:00.139Z)

an account p o r,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:01.792Z)

on an amount POR,

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:03.589Z)

percent of revenue,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:04.792Z)

PAR, percent of revenue,

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:05.979Z)

and you may even have two revenue

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:08.332Z)

and you maybe even have a two revenues. One's percent of total revenue and one's percent of departmental revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:08.359Z)

once percent of total revenue. Like, 1% of departmental revenue. In the case of food and beverage expenses,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:14.732Z)

In the case of, like, food and beverage expenses,

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:15.769Z)

percent of revenue, was really percent

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:17.452Z)

percent of revenue would really be percent of departmental revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:17.819Z)

to cartonnel revenue. But in the case of, like, Admin and Joe, where's the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:21.152Z)

But in the case of, like, admin in general where there is no revenue in that department,

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:21.759Z)

BSL revenue in that department, then comes percent of revenue in the department

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:25.552Z)

then it becomes percent of

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:26.169Z)

percent of total revenue. Got it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:27.092Z)

revenues percent of total revenue. And users are gonna say that

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:27.989Z)

User say now.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:31.492Z)

interchangeably. They're gonna say, food and beverage percent of revenue and they're just gonna expect you to know that they need departmental revenue

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:35.729Z)

The functional revenue versus the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:39.142Z)

versus if they say, a and g or sales marketing. When they say percent of revenue, they mean total revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:41.149Z)

So I don't know whether it's sensitive

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:43.832Z)

So I don't know whether it makes sense to set that as a

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:45.109Z)

set that as a don't I don't know whether that's

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:48.672Z)

I don't know whether that's one thing or two things.

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:48.699Z)

one thing or two things. But that make sense?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:04:52.332Z)

But you know, does that make sense?

### You (2025-06-02T21:04:52.849Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It it makes sense. So you're saying that if I can paraphrase here, that certain items would be a percentage of the total rooms revenue Right? And then so it could be a percentage of the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:13.242Z)

And the total hotel

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:14.179Z)

department revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:15.092Z)

yeah. Like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:15.519Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:19.762Z)

we might go back to the sample data here.

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:25.739Z)

Right. And I would just

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:30.772Z)

Right? This I put this together to kinda show, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:31.599Z)

yes.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:33.862Z)

here's sort of a very condensed

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:34.919Z)

Sort of a You know? Format. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:39.052Z)

you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:40.439Z)

Key

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:40.872Z)

format. Right? This being the key

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:40.959Z)

part of this in your

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:43.222Z)

part, this being your rooms available,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:43.279Z)

rooms sold.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:45.552Z)

rooms sold, Right? So if a user is projecting so what I've the first thing I'm getting at I think it makes sense, like, all of the stuff Diane was saying when she was saying,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:56.739Z)

All these things here.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:57.522Z)

you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:58.429Z)

I mean, there are

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:05:59.142Z)

all these things here,

### You (2025-06-02T21:05:59.339Z)

car bound exceptions as you think.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:00.912Z)

mean, there are some carve outs and exceptions, and and she's saying that, like, this department is usually done on

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:01.599Z)

Like, this department is usually going to be PR this one a POM. It's a

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:05.462Z)

a PAR basis, this one on a POR basis, all that. I I I think don't worry about that. I think just create a mechanism by which a user can select

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:11.329Z)

You know? Are they projecting on an amount?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:14.222Z)

you know, are they projecting on an amount? POR, EAR, basis, and then the last one being

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:22.449Z)

Percent of revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:24.092Z)

you know, percent of revenue. And what I'm getting at is that that means a slightly different thing depending on what you're looking at. These departments departments here are called operating departments. So they have a corresponding revenue and expense. And these ones down here, undistributed, do not have a corresponding

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:43.579Z)

Pay on the expenses.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:45.022Z)

revenue. They are only expenses. So when when somebody says, Diane said they're, like, a and g is projected on a percent of revenue basis, she means percent of total revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:57.009Z)

Just talking about

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:06:58.712Z)

But when she's talking about food and beverage, percent of revenue means

### You (2025-06-02T21:06:59.059Z)

revenue. Percent of the course

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:02.242Z)

percent of the corresponding departmental revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:02.579Z)

Got it. So create negative

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:05.132Z)

So creating mechanism

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:06.649Z)

what's getting there is, like, I think that's

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:07.442Z)

maybe it's

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:08.159Z)

one.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:08.602Z)

what I'm getting at is, like, if that's one or more things, maybe it's

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:08.849Z)

Or six. Maybe it's

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:12.702Z)

one thing. I don't know if it you created one thing that's, like, percent of revenue, and then you just

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:17.629Z)

means.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:17.642Z)

the system has to know what that means. Or if you create one more things like this, percent

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:19.939Z)

Like this. Perspective. Oh,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:23.292Z)

of room.

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:27.799Z)

over.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:32.612Z)

Maybe this is of operated I mean, technically, there was this is almost never gonna happen, so it's really new. But

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:44.239Z)

That degree.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:45.022Z)

maybe it makes sense to create something more like this. So percent of revenue is not actually just one thing. It's actually

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:52.039Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:52.922Z)

three or four different things.

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:53.169Z)

It's case

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:55.072Z)

And

### You (2025-06-02T21:07:55.359Z)

select

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:07:55.832Z)

in the case where a user selects if they wanna make their projections for other operated on a percent of revenue basis, In that case, from an expense perspective, it's always gonna be the corresponding departmental revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:08:10.659Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:08:11.322Z)

Favorite food and beverage,

### You (2025-06-02T21:08:11.979Z)

First,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:08:13.152Z)

right, versus if they're down here, percent of revenue means you know, percent of total revenue. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:08:18.259Z)

k. If you're clicking the option

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:08:20.742Z)

if you're creating these options,

### You (2025-06-02T21:08:21.329Z)

I just want to If

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:08:23.652Z)

I just wanted it to be extra clear that what they are, and I think you can you can use the same options. You don't have to, like, tailor it to each by each department. I think you can say, like, if I'm projecting utilities, I project it on a

### You (2025-06-02T21:08:37.859Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:08:40.592Z)

amount POR, PAR percent of revenue. Right? Like, it's it's the same thing in each case. That that's even if even if in some cases, maybe, like, some of them never get used, I think that's fine. You're just you wanna make sure you have, you know, have a consistent that that mechanism to to choose the way in which you project input your assumptions. I think that that is just one mechanism you create apply to all the different

### You (2025-06-02T21:09:07.329Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So Vinod and I were talking, and I think this ties

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:09:07.832Z)

input areas. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-06-02T21:09:11.479Z)

directly into this. So what we're doing is we are setting up a process for the user to input a deal. Right? So whether I'm a broker, investor, whatever, I log in to Invest AI. Click on create a deal, And that's where I input the name, address, etcetera. As part of that initial process, we thought, that we would have like a checklist of all the different departments. That's why I put in that chat that here's all the other departments that I could find in Mark spreadsheet. And basically, they can check whatever they have. Right? And and then that will then control when they go and do the the revenue and expenses If they don't have any other departments, I mean, if it's just your, you know, your motel six and all of their revenue is rooms revenue, they don't have anything else. We don't even want that to show in in the tool. Right? But if it's you know, something that does have a restaurant and a bar or whatever, when they set that up, they check those boxes, then they will have the corresponding revenue and expense section. In which case then, they could go ahead and put in their projections based on any of those selections put in there. Right? So Yeah. You know, that way, they would say, okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:10:44.222Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-02T21:10:44.679Z)

Here's my food and beverage. I don't want spa. Or anything else. To show up in this page if it doesn't have a spa. Right? Yeah. You know, of course,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:10:55.112Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-06-02T21:10:56.929Z)

we will have to account for, you know, those situations where maybe they wanna add a spa. Right? You never know. But at that point they could simply click on spa when they set it up. It just won't have any historical data associated with it. And then they can then go ahead and project, you know, maybe starting year three or year four or whatever. So it's it's a it's an easy thing to do. Not not difficult at all. So this is very helpful. So I'm thinking it so what I'm hearing then so you've got operating departments so so it looks like to me, like, if it's an undistributed istributed expense, that's when you go percent of rooms revenue. If it's an operating department, the or full full revenue. Yeah. And then and then if it's a

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:11:55.002Z)

Instead of total revenue. So and I'm just yeah,

### You (2025-06-02T21:11:58.779Z)

operating department, it's just a percentage of that particular department. Yeah. Okay. So so that's really the the trigger to me

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:12:05.392Z)

Yeah. So it's really

### You (2025-06-02T21:12:08.409Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:12:09.362Z)

it's really just yeah. I don't actually like weird.

### You (2025-06-02T21:12:09.489Z)

Good. K.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:12:12.482Z)

It's really just these three would be, you know, Really, just these three departments that where it means, you know, depart percent of department revenue. These ones if they use it right. Sometimes you you do your ARC ADR RevPAR calculations and you say the property is gonna generate however much millions of rooms revenue

### You (2025-06-02T21:12:48.129Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:12:50.762Z)

Right? And then you might and then for food and beverage or other operator, other operator or miscellaneous, a a user might just say, it's gonna be, you know, p o this much on a POR basis, a p r PAR basis, or or or, like, food food and beverage revenue is gonna be an additional 2%. Right? They might just, like, so I I don't I guess, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:14.219Z)

Perspective.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:14.572Z)

don't know how you do that from a calculations perspective because

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:14.879Z)

Because

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:20.002Z)

for expenses, it's for these expenses, it's I mean, it's pretty straightforward. It's like, you've calculated your revenue

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:25.399Z)

Your total So you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:28.072Z)

total revenue, So if they say, you know, per tenth of revenue means total. Revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:37.279Z)

so you when you say that, that means rooms so yeah. Everything. Everything that's in revenue. You're not segregating out your food and beverage Right. Rooms from your spa. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:47.092Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:47.799Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:48.772Z)

Yeah. That's why these are called undistributed departments. Because their expenses are undistributed, so they apply to everything.

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:53.539Z)

Okay. Yeah. And without getting

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:56.422Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:13:57.539Z)

back here, Room

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:13:59.132Z)

What I was getting at up here is rooms revenue is

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:03.919Z)

Not

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:05.162Z)

not gonna be

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:06.599Z)

don't be ever projecting on paper.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:07.572Z)

I think, ever projected on a percent of revenue basis. Because it's always calculated on a using occupancy and ADR. Like, that's fundamentally how you do it.

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:16.179Z)

The v it's

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:18.882Z)

The these three

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:19.759Z)

bit of a cluster

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:21.462Z)

in the case of a select service hotel, right, they might say it's a couple of dollars per occupied room. Per occupied room. Yeah. Or they might say, you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:32.249Z)

percent.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:32.382Z)

food and beverage is gonna be an additional 1%.

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:32.729Z)

You know, Other 2%.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:35.492Z)

You know, other operators, another

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:36.739Z)

Say.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:38.012Z)

2%. Right? Like, you might say that you what you the with the conclusion you might wanna come to is that Rooms revenue is 95% of revenue. And the the three of these comprise the remaining 5%. So whatever room revenue grows, however rooms revenue grows over the next five years, just you know, these are gonna grow at the same rate. At a you know, so that they collectively make up 5% of

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:57.139Z)

The rate. Okay. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:14:59.382Z)

the the remaining 5% of revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:14:59.599Z)

So whether

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:01.202Z)

Right? So

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:01.279Z)

calculate that that's probably a ton of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:02.632Z)

whether you calculate that

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:05.129Z)

But

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:05.182Z)

that's probably a less common

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:06.159Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:07.212Z)

way to do it, but it is

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:07.449Z)

something think.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:08.992Z)

you know, something that I think

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:10.409Z)

Some cases.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:11.072Z)

users might do in some cases.

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:14.699Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:14.752Z)

Did did that make sense?

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:15.229Z)

So we can

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:16.022Z)

Like, what I'm getting at?

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:16.289Z)

do it. Still

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:17.352Z)

So, again, it's still it's still percent of total revenue. That you're doing here? Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:28.489Z)

So Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:31.172Z)

So yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:32.049Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:33.902Z)

That was what I wanted to get at there. And then with the other part you mentioned here, you're talking about these departments. So wanted to be really so, like, Mark being you know, Mark's

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:47.889Z)

Higher perspective. Right? And

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:50.672Z)

looking at things from a higher perspective. Right? And and

### You (2025-06-02T21:15:50.979Z)

looking up in a few keep that particular number.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:15:53.762Z)

he's not gonna be as particular about, like, what is the department versus what is an expense. Right? Or, like, what is an account versus a department? And I've kinda mentioned that before. Right? We have this sort of two dimensional

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:05.699Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:06.462Z)

hierarchy Right? You have, like, on the accounts, you have revenues.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:10.209Z)

Cost of goods sold

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:11.802Z)

You have cost of goods sold. Labor, PTEB,

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:15.309Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:16.732Z)

controllable expenses,

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:18.029Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:18.412Z)

Right? Like, these are all different types of expenses. Which I I would say those are all part of the account hierarchy.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:23.759Z)

Others

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:25.612Z)

And then the other side of it is you have the department.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:26.119Z)

Right? The art hierarchy. So pretty much

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:28.712Z)

Right? The department hierarchy. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:29.999Z)

one of those. So much

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:30.832Z)

pretty much any one of those expenses

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:31.349Z)

revenue or expenses

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:33.942Z)

revenues or expenses, could show up in pretty much any one of the departments.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:36.769Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:38.662Z)

Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:38.849Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:39.442Z)

So you could have

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:39.679Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:41.432Z)

you know, you could have a and the way I think of it is, like, an account is

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:42.199Z)

Is what

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:45.352Z)

what you are

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:46.739Z)

is

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:46.862Z)

buying or selling.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:47.199Z)

where Vegas.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:48.242Z)

The department is where or I guess it's what

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:48.539Z)

What

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:52.242Z)

revenue or expense is incurred

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:53.809Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:54.542Z)

and the department is where.

### You (2025-06-02T21:16:54.829Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:16:56.552Z)

That is usually the way I think of it. Right? So it's, you know, it's gonna be where being, like, rooms, food and beverage, other operated a and g, whatever. These don't correspond to

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:09.859Z)

Physical areas in the hotel.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:10.392Z)

generally, like, physical areas in the hotel. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:11.379Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:15.562Z)

Even these undistributed expenses are often, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:19.539Z)

An area.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:19.892Z)

specific you know, there's, like, a usually, like, a maintenance area, and the and the engineering team is based there. There's a sales marketing office, and the sales marketing office stays there.

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:26.579Z)

Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:27.072Z)

There's a tech person. There's an AG office. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:27.559Z)

So they're really Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:29.772Z)

So

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:30.109Z)

Correspond to areas at the top

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:30.682Z)

they're really corresponding areas. Right? Corresponding to areas in the hotel.

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:31.619Z)

Yep. I have told you

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:35.422Z)

So at a small hotel, the areas might be very small or or, you know, it nothing more than a name plaque. Right? Or, like, a a desk, you know, a desk or an in a larger in an office. But for big hotel, they're going to be to completely dedicated

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:52.449Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:53.782Z)

offices and areas. Right? So

### You (2025-06-02T21:17:56.089Z)

expenses,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:17:56.662Z)

and there are some expenses and revenues that are like, more significant than others. Right? And so, like, your rooms revenue only shows up in your rooms department. You know, that

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:11.119Z)

You phone.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:11.862Z)

pretty self explanatory. Right? And that's a that's a

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:12.489Z)

A It worked.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:14.412Z)

very, very important obvious item that that gets kinda broken out. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:15.519Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:18.902Z)

Example is, like, I think, like, in in her thing up here, Diane mentioned credit card commissions. Right? Like, that's

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:28.319Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:28.942Z)

always in the a and g department.

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:30.709Z)

2% of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:30.932Z)

And it's significant. It's like

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:31.919Z)

tool.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:33.342Z)

two to 3% of total revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:34.099Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:35.352Z)

Right? So in your ENG department, your credit card commissions might be, like, you know, 10% of your total. Right? Like, they give you huge of the total cost. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:18:44.049Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:18:46.172Z)

Sales marketing, you're gonna have franchise fees. Similarly, like, it might be half your sales marketing cost might be the franchise fees. Right? And they only show up in sales department. So you have these specialized, you know, specific costs, generally costs that show up only in specific departments. Which is what Diane is getting at that you would wanna break them out because I think what we've been talking about initially is that you have this very high level view here. And then anything else is on a breakout tab.

### You (2025-06-02T21:19:14.509Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:19:19.182Z)

And I still think that is largely true. I think Diane is trying to get at that there are certain items that merit an they're significant enough that they ideally would be elevated

### You (2025-06-02T21:19:30.849Z)

Well, here

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:19:31.192Z)

before you get to the breakout tab.

### You (2025-06-02T21:19:32.159Z)

here's the thing to remember. In Excel, you're gonna have a breakout tab. In an online application, see how you got the minus sign right next to undistributed expenses? You know, typically, that's used to expand and contract. This is what I visualize in our tool.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:19:47.862Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:19:51.509Z)

Is that if you want to see all those line items that make up the admin admin general you can just click on the caret, they call it, it expands. And you see all the lines down below. You don't have to go to a different page. I that's the thing is we don't want users to have to jump around. So just just a point of clarification I I want to have everything on one page. And so there will be links. Like, you know, when you go to a website, and you've got links at the top of the page, when you click on them, you don't go to a different page. It just takes you down on the page to where that item is located. Yeah. This is how I want this page to work as well.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:20:31.042Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:20:32.139Z)

In our in our app. So I if you have to jump around from page to page, then you you don't gain any advantage over Excel. And then the question is, well, why should I change?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:20:42.492Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-06-02T21:20:43.569Z)

Yeah. You know, it's the same thing. So ideally then so for example, that thirty eight one twenty three zero eight for admin in general, would be a sum of those accounts down below.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:20:57.092Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:20:57.849Z)

Yeah. And so, you know, the you could even get down to the line item. Right? Utilities is a great example. What if they go and they do a water retro retrofit and they you know, their water bill might be reduced 10%. You know? You don't you you but you could go through, and you could choose you know, you wouldn't have to use the same option for even the subaccounts. You know you know, one line could be a percentage of revenue. Another one could be Yeah. Percentage growth. And then add up to that. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:21:29.702Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:21:31.719Z)

Okay. Whether we can do that,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:21:33.402Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-02T21:21:33.939Z)

in two weeks for proof of concept, remains to be seen. But but

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:21:37.072Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other challenge

### You (2025-06-02T21:21:40.869Z)

that ideally is where we wanna be.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:21:42.662Z)

the other

### You (2025-06-02T21:21:42.919Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:21:43.442Z)

challenge yeah. And the the thing the other challenge is that if you're getting data from us, like, we get a lot of granularity. Like, we have all that account level detail. But for the initial like, you're getting a starting with a new deal that's like, you know, you're getting data from a from a deal room, it's not gonna be

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:04.019Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:06.222Z)

like, you know, I showed you all those PNLs. Right? They had a summary tab, and then they had all the detailed tab by each department.

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:10.249Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:13.982Z)

That's where it becomes like the summary tab is generally pretty easy to automatically pull because it's fairly consistent. Once you get into the details tab the as you get into the details, the the the differences become greater and the data is less and less consistent. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:25.269Z)

So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:28.792Z)

if if you're getting it at all. Right? So in the case of, like, a new you know, a property that's that's not owned by you already that you're underwriting for new acquisition, But then the question is, like, how do you get all that data

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:40.669Z)

And it's come

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:41.682Z)

in there. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:42.579Z)

to it

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:43.282Z)

And it becomes it it's

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:44.859Z)

like, if

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:46.202Z)

like, if we could do if we could

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:46.669Z)

if we do it all

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:49.462Z)

if we could do it all automatically,

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:49.589Z)

then it's done a layer. But

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:52.362Z)

then it would be a no brainer.

### You (2025-06-02T21:22:52.609Z)

it it's kinda

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:22:54.652Z)

But it it's kind of like the inverse thing of, like, well, I guess not inverse. It's it's in parallel that the the more complicated it is, for us to do and, therefore, the less likely

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:04.079Z)

benefit for us. Develop it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:05.852Z)

the more time it's gonna take for us to develop it, It's also more complicated and time consuming for the user.

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:08.749Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:11.502Z)

If we ask the user to put in that information, they're gonna be like, no. Hell no. Not putting in ten years of history for every account level. Like, that's just not

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:16.079Z)

Yeah. And we and we would make it optional. I mean, if they wanna get into that level of detail, no problem. If they don't, we can we can deal with it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:23.242Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:23.809Z)

Either way. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:27.192Z)

Yes. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:29.489Z)

So just

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:30.432Z)

okay. So the other thing that the the what I wanted to get at the second part of this is looking at, you know, these departments you laid out here. I wanted to be really clear about how this and this is we this is how we organize it, but I'll I'll I'll say that this is not just

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:45.789Z)

k.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:46.772Z)

us. This is, like, industry standard. Again, Mark and Diane are probably not gonna be as particular about it as I am because they're you know, from their point of view, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:23:55.859Z)

Like

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:23:57.162Z)

like, in the miscellaneous department, like, the biggest thing in here generally is going to be for for depending on what you're looking at. Like, if you're looking at resort, miscellaneous is mostly gonna be

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:08.009Z)

why

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:08.872Z)

resort fees.

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:08.979Z)

I did.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:09.752Z)

Like and that's why think on the list here, you have resort fees as a department. But that's really not a department. It's an account.

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:14.919Z)

Okay. Alright. Really

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:17.722Z)

And so

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:17.829Z)

you know, it's like the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:19.782Z)

it's really you know, it it might be the only account in the miscellaneous department in some cases. But it it is still an account. And that's that's why I wanna be, like, really you know, again, same, like, credit card commission, like, A and G's you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:34.169Z)

you

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:34.192Z)

not a department. It is a department, not an expense. Credit card fees are are an account, like an expense in the a and g department.

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:40.519Z)

Right? So, actually,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:42.612Z)

Right? So I just wanted to be super clear about

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:42.719Z)

about so if I if I pull

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:45.762Z)

about, like, what that is. So if I if I blow up the department hierarchy,

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:45.929Z)

the department higher,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:50.292Z)

and and to your point about selecting you know, which

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:53.429Z)

like, user creating.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:54.682Z)

like, a user is creating a new deal and they wanna, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:24:54.869Z)

New deal, and they wanted help.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:24:58.872Z)

which departments are they going to include? You know, like, right off the bat. A lot of times, it would be if they're adding a new spot, like, they're adding something new, that's gonna be new. But, otherwise, a lot of times, it's gonna be predicated on what's their

### You (2025-06-02T21:25:11.669Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:25:12.982Z)

already. Right? So like, I have some some breakout here. Right? So food and beverage, you know, it's very clearly, it's, like, things that sell majority

### You (2025-06-02T21:25:21.679Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:25:25.532Z)

food or beverage. Right? So you have, like, outlets, which could be, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:25:25.969Z)

Restaurant, lounges, my night This is, like, in the night.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:25:28.742Z)

restaurants, lounges, fine dining. This is, in room dining.

### You (2025-06-02T21:25:32.349Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:25:33.412Z)

Actually, just go down there. The next one. So

### You (2025-06-02T21:25:52.009Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:25:52.402Z)

They can kinda see it. Right? Like, so within rooms, you have a lot of, you know, bunch of different departments that might sub departments that might exist. You know? And a lot of times, like, not all the operators are gonna have this. A lot of times, just gonna put everything in rooms. It's so you don't have these sub departments. But within food and beverage and other operated,

### You (2025-06-02T21:26:12.659Z)

Afraid.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:26:16.352Z)

like, you very clearly, you'll have, like, at a bigger hotel, you'll have, you know, multiple dining outlets, You'll have in room dining. You'll have banquets catering in AV, different multiple kitchens, etcetera. And then within the other operated it's very specifically, like, anything you know, other operated has to have a corresponding It has to be an operating department. Right? So you could have, you know, golf, farms, vineyards, racquetball, marinas, pools, kids clubs, all this stuff. Right? Tons of different

### You (2025-06-02T21:26:47.609Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:26:49.462Z)

you know, Again, like, only the really big hotels have all this detail. Like, most hotels are just gonna have, like, you know, like, parking and

### You (2025-06-02T21:26:57.209Z)

I would reach

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:26:58.612Z)

and a recreation, you know, set, like, activities maybe.

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:01.379Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:02.562Z)

Maybe a fitness center and that's it. And then miscellaneous has does not ever have any sub departments. It's always just miscellaneous.

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:08.299Z)

Yeah. And then

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:12.242Z)

And then in the a and g side, a and g is know, accounting,

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:16.359Z)

So our pick

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:17.092Z)

administration, human resources security. Sales marketing, IT, whatever. So this is the department hierarchy. And I mean, again, not all hotels use all of this. Know, in fact, I think most don't use all of this.

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:31.569Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:33.102Z)

This would be a very

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:34.059Z)

it beautiful

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:34.712Z)

like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:36.499Z)

standard.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:36.992Z)

this is uniform subaccount standard, like, you know, this is, like, how you should you should think of these as your your primary overarching departments, and then these would be the kind of details that go

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:45.519Z)

Oh, yeah. This is Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:48.102Z)

into them.

### You (2025-06-02T21:27:48.669Z)

So are you in the spreadsheet that's uploaded to the team site?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:27:50.262Z)

Yeah. And then I'll just ahead. No. But I'll I'll upload this one as well.

### You (2025-06-02T21:28:00.569Z)

So I thought there was a sample data spreadsheet, but I was gonna say I I

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:28:05.912Z)

There it is. There it is. I'm I just opened it up on my desktop.

### You (2025-06-02T21:28:06.709Z)

I Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:28:10.472Z)

So I'll reload this one as, a v two.

### You (2025-06-02T21:28:10.479Z)

Okay. No. That that that's fine. As long as I've been jotting down which columns to select from the pivot table. So Yeah. K.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:28:20.662Z)

Yeah. And you'll see all of this in the sample data. Like, you'll you see anything, you know, in the hierarchy, there's account and department. I'm gonna just show you the account hierarchy. As well.

### You (2025-06-02T21:28:41.479Z)

Yeah. Where I got that list was Mark's spreadsheet, and each of those items was just a manual input. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:28:52.542Z)

Yeah. And that's what I'm saying. It's like

### You (2025-06-02T21:28:52.879Z)

So whoever input them then probably wasn't concerned about whether it's a category, subcategory,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:28:59.212Z)

yeah. Yeah. And it's and it's like each deal is gonna be different. Right? Like, some deals, you're gonna have resort fees are gonna be a big deal. If you're looking at a resort. But if you're looking at a urban select service hotel, there's no resort fees. So you wouldn't put that in.

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:09.369Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:12.282Z)

But the way that this is the way that I'm showing you this is organized, this is the way every single hotel organizes it. Whether, you know, certain but just, you know, certain items may or may not be relevant, know, for a specific deal.

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:22.129Z)

Right. Okay. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:25.662Z)

Right? Like, the the the activities that that's gonna be included in a resort is very different than what will be included as select service property.

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:31.219Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:35.202Z)

Account type, class, subcategory. Okay. So here. So now this is the account hire hierarchy. Kind of way. And and you'll see in the sample in the sample data, they are combined.

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:43.039Z)

But I'm just breaking out here. See.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:45.802Z)

But I'm just breaking them out here so you can see

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:46.169Z)

Perfect. Oh, yeah. This this is very, very helpful.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:52.382Z)

So you see very

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:53.409Z)

Right. Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:54.692Z)

clearly right, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:29:56.469Z)

we're a couple different types of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:29:59.382Z)

room sales,

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:00.049Z)

you know, group

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:01.212Z)

all the different types of

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:01.799Z)

sales. These would

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:02.912Z)

you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:03.409Z)

only

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:03.612Z)

room sales,

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:03.939Z)

all of the group's department.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:05.102Z)

These would

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:05.199Z)

Mhmm. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:06.242Z)

only fall into the rooms department. Right? When it comes to food and beverage, they could fall into any one of the food and beverage departments.

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:10.409Z)

Yep. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:13.372Z)

Right? And sometimes you'll even have food sales in another operated department if you have like, a a mark like like, I have, a a gift shop that sells food. You might have an account for food in the gift shop. And then

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:20.629Z)

K. And then other other sales basically everything

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:24.372Z)

these other

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:24.719Z)

from it. You know, fees, charges,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:25.372Z)

other sales basically includes everything from

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:27.009Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:28.102Z)

fees, charges,

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:28.649Z)

so stuff again. It makes all the money. You're gonna have other sales

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:29.852Z)

you know, all sorts of random stuff in here, and they could fall into any department. So you're gonna have other sales that are gonna fall into any of any of the

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:35.219Z)

Right. Right? And so

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:38.082Z)

operating departments.

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:38.929Z)

that's why we keep it in

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:39.462Z)

Right? And so

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:39.899Z)

we definitely go to the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:40.972Z)

that's why, like, if you get this week, if we go to the

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:41.119Z)

financial data track here, like, like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:43.962Z)

financial data extract here, right, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:44.909Z)

see these are combined. Account type, account size,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:47.182Z)

you'll see these are combined.

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:48.799Z)

class.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:49.022Z)

Account type, account class, department type, department class.

### You (2025-06-02T21:30:49.359Z)

Right? I got a pretty heavy work.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:30:52.132Z)

Right? So I kinda put it in the order that it would kinda make sense to see it. You just start to see that, like, you're gonna in the outlets, you you have right, like, you in in just this outlet here, the lounge bar, you have food and beverage sales and other sales.

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:05.339Z)

Right? And that's the same

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:08.252Z)

Right? And then you have the same account occurring over and over again.

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:09.199Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:12.072Z)

And and I think, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:12.279Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:13.792Z)

down the road, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:15.789Z)

I'll tell the are

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:17.782Z)

most

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:17.799Z)

accounting systems.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:18.672Z)

hotel systems are

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:20.269Z)

So they're very

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:20.642Z)

accounting systems or they're based on accounting systems. So they're very, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:21.189Z)

like, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:24.322Z)

they don't give you a lot of flexibility. You can't just, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:26.479Z)

this account here.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:26.822Z)

you know, take in a this account here and this you can't just, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:27.659Z)

Can't like, manipulate slice the data very easily. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:31.272Z)

manipulate, slice, and dice the data very easily. It it you know, you can create a PNL based on a specific structure,

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:34.679Z)

But it but that's it. Yeah. Right?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:37.472Z)

but it but that's it. Right? Our system is multidimensional, so it allows you to move data around very easily. And I hope that ours can do the same.

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:44.039Z)

If you're doing a %,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:45.882Z)

So that, like, you're doing your underwriting and your underwrite you get, like, a big resort, you know, you might underwrite

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:47.299Z)

you know, like, resort, like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:51.532Z)

a a lounge, a coffee shop, inland dining, whatever.

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:54.639Z)

you want it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:55.972Z)

You know. And then

### You (2025-06-02T21:31:56.989Z)

Done all these

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:31:57.492Z)

you wanna see, like, okay. Well, I've done all these individual outlets now. What is that look like for my total my total F and B revenue?

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:03.519Z)

and beverage. Revenue.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:05.502Z)

Total food and beverage revenue, right, and cost of sales, you know, being able to because as you can drill down in in you know, along the department, hierarchy or you can drill down on the account

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:14.379Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:15.982Z)

hierarchy. And our system does that very easily, but most other systems don't. And I think when people do

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:20.789Z)

Thank you for the family.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:22.242Z)

when they they do underwriting,

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:23.979Z)

Now have

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:24.062Z)

they just build it manually so that they can they'll have one tab that's summary and one tab that's the detail, but it doesn't

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:27.839Z)

fit their link. Yeah. You know, first hire people.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:30.632Z)

they're just links, you know, versus hierarchical.

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:31.699Z)

They have the I wanted to just articulate it. It's expensive. Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:34.842Z)

But, yeah, first, I wanna just articulate. And same with expenses. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:36.119Z)

I think, eventually, our system is we try to build in for a guy, you

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:38.282Z)

and I think eventually, as our system as we

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:40.659Z)

you

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:41.032Z)

to build in more AI, you you would

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:41.199Z)

say, know, if you're putting in expenses for all your salaries and with every

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:43.492Z)

you could say, you know, if you're putting in expenses for all your salaries and what like, every department has salaries and wages. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:47.179Z)

Right? And it would be right now,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:50.252Z)

And

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:50.369Z)

would be very difficult to say, like, okay. What are my full salaries and wages?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:51.452Z)

it would be right now, it's it would be very difficult to say, like, okay. What are my total salaries and wages for the

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:55.779Z)

Is that too much or too

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:56.422Z)

entire hotel? How much are they going up?

### You (2025-06-02T21:32:57.589Z)

And I look at it like, well, my salaries rates are going up,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:32:58.582Z)

Is that too much or too little? And if I look at it like, wow. My salaries and wages are going up.

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:01.389Z)

a lot. You know?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:03.722Z)

A lot. You know? Like, okay. Well, what department is causing it the most?

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:04.889Z)

The most? You know, can I turn that back? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:07.972Z)

And, you know, can I trim that back?

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:09.599Z)

We don't

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:09.942Z)

Versus if you're otherwise, you're it always look at things by department first. Revenues and expenses, but, like, by department. So very

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:15.279Z)

no. Home. The other

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:18.162Z)

not very often does a user get to say, like, oh, salaries and wages altogether by department. They usually only see, like, just don't get the same level of granularity. But if you want us to make sure that we structure the data in the way that there's the right relationships between these accounts

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:31.879Z)

expenses, and you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:33.452Z)

revenues and expenses, and

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:33.739Z)

parts you know, So they can be

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:35.922Z)

and the departments, you know, so that they can be

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:36.069Z)

provided. Separate. Yeah. Yeah, we didn't have nearly as many points

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:38.932Z)

combined and separated.

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:42.179Z)

where it can cross over in multifamily, but there are some. Particularly repairs and maintenance. And even some utilities. Right? So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:33:51.092Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:33:52.399Z)

you know, if I if I'm going to change the carpet in an apartment, right, If it's an occupied apartment, it would go under category. Or if it's changed after the resident moves out, before the new resident moves in, well, then it's a turnover it's not a maintenance cost. But that's really the extent of it in a multi family. But the way that you've got it set up here is is definitely the way to do it. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:24.312Z)

Yeah. And here and the hotels, as we've talked before, are thankfully I mean, they're it's

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:24.509Z)

Thankfully Yeah. Way more complicated. However, they

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:29.202Z)

way more complicated

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:29.929Z)

much more

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:30.942Z)

However, they are also generally

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:32.709Z)

I would rather have it complicated, but only one complicated.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:33.042Z)

much more organized. Even at the most

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:36.489Z)

Than than let every client do whatever they want, which is the case in multifamily. Is no yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:43.712Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:44.759Z)

And no kind of formatting there. Revenue on top, expenses on the bottom.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:47.472Z)

Yeah. No. Here, it's all yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:48.729Z)

That's it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:50.362Z)

That's it. Now here, it's it's very it's very organized.

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:52.189Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And the account you know, on the back end of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:34:55.192Z)

And the accountants you know, on the back end of this that are that are, you know, creating this data are generally

### You (2025-06-02T21:34:57.179Z)

getting the data, Very good. 95% of it will be

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:01.572Z)

very good about

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:03.199Z)

where it's supposed

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:03.362Z)

you know, 95% of it will be

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:04.289Z)

be You know, there's there's a little bit of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:06.072Z)

where it's supposed to be. You know, there's there's little differences here and there, but generally, it's all pretty well organized.

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:08.799Z)

like that.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:11.502Z)

Somebody like Diane and Mark, I mean, this is, like, way more granular than they ever really need to guess That's why they're not

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:16.869Z)

Structure.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:17.092Z)

gonna, like, lay it out as quite as structured as I am. But I just wanna make sure that that's

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:18.179Z)

Just wanna make sure

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:22.062Z)

it's clear that this is how it it's it's organized.

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:22.159Z)

Well, I I wanna, yeah, I wanna make sure that we're prepared you know, if we ever do get down to the department group level. That would be a simple fix if we've got the types, class, and category already in there ahead of time. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:37.982Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:38.369Z)

I would think that for the proof of concept,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:35:40.812Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:35:41.539Z)

you know, we definitely wanna get you know, getting to the department class, not problem. But if we could even get down to the department category, to have outlets and banquets and a few other things, Even if it's just you know, demo data just to show that we can get to that level of granularity early in the game, that would be very helpful. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:07.152Z)

Yeah. It

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:09.469Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:10.512Z)

it does. It it that's where it starts to because

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:10.809Z)

It definitely

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:14.732Z)

when you get down so this is this level here I'm showing you is kind of the summary operating statement.

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:16.739Z)

Which is again, but

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:19.122Z)

Which is, again, what I was this is gonna be our the high level how users are gonna look look at at the end of it. Right? Like, when they go do all their assumptions, they're gonna come back and they're gonna like, all the output tabs and all these models,

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:32.029Z)

look at this. With

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:34.162Z)

basically, look at this with, you know, ARC, ADR, RevPar on top,

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:34.979Z)

Yeah. And you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:38.052Z)

And, you know, then they'll have, like, GOP, departmental profit, EBITDA. Right? But, basically, this is the format. Right? So at the end of it, this is what they're looking at.

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:43.349Z)

what they're looking at. If you want to go to the next level, the check, you know, becomes like, okay. I wanna go down one level.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:47.232Z)

If you wanna go down to the next level, the check you know, it becomes like, okay. Well, do I wanna go down one level

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:51.219Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:53.972Z)

by department?

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:54.289Z)

by department. Department.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:36:55.152Z)

Or do I wanna go down one level by by account? So it becomes exponentially more complicated depending on which way you wanna

### You (2025-06-02T21:36:59.419Z)

Know which way you wanna go Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:03.232Z)

or do you wanna do both?

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:03.349Z)

I think if I

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:05.602Z)

So I think it is

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:07.319Z)

I I get the

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:08.162Z)

I I guess we yeah. The data model has to be set up

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:08.199Z)

the data all right. Set up. Accordingly. We lines

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:12.442Z)

accordingly, which, again, the the data that I

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:13.489Z)

both social

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:14.902Z)

given you here has both. So you could just, you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:15.629Z)

do it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:18.452Z)

theoretically pick Do I wanna go down to the decks department category, or do I wanna go down to account category? Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:21.319Z)

Right? As far as, like, what the user are looking at,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:25.472Z)

As far as, like, what the users are looking at,

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:25.679Z)

I think what what I getting at with her comments.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:28.622Z)

I think what

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:29.239Z)

Even with that,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:29.802Z)

what Diane was getting at with her comment here is that for, like, for select service hotels anyway. Right? Like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:37:38.789Z)

think

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:37:41.622Z)

big full service hotels, are you know, they might wanna go down and break out food and beverage into respective outlets or other operated into respective outlets or breakout miscellaneous into the respective accounts for resort fees and commissions and stuff like that. But for select service, it would be like this would be sufficient to do most of what you wanted to do with the exception that there are those big account items that you would wanna break out, like, a and g or, excuse me, you'd wanna see, like, credit card commission as a

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:08.659Z)

as a

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:38:11.972Z)

you know, as a percent of revenue. Or if you'd want to see credit card commissions broken out from AMG. And sales marketing, you wanna see, like, your franchise fees broken out from the rest of sales and marketing. And and same as, like, you know, may like, so so kinda, like, I guess what I'm getting at is, like, I know if it if

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:27.819Z)

if could be.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:38:30.672Z)

if for this first proof of concept, this first you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:32.589Z)

You know, work at it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:38:35.992Z)

pass at it,

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:36.369Z)

Get down.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:38:37.452Z)

it makes sense to try to get down to the next level

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:39.409Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:38:40.912Z)

on everything. As much as it does create the get the right big ticket items broken out here. Users are gonna wanna see. Right? Which, again, credit card commissions being a big one. Sales marketing, they wanna break out franchise fees.

### You (2025-06-02T21:38:56.989Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:00.012Z)

Like food and beverage.

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:00.849Z)

you will sale. K. Cost sales.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:03.842Z)

You wanna cost of sales.

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:04.499Z)

And other. Right? So it's like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:05.512Z)

Cost of sales, labor, and other. Right? So it's like

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:07.699Z)

that that

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:08.872Z)

it it's almost like, I think, that that that would be, I think, more useful to most of the users we would take this to and probably easier to do than to try to tackle all the possible combinations of of the next level down.

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:22.699Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:25.612Z)

I I don't know. I don't I mean, it's probably maybe that's not no different when you're doing the data model. On the back end because you're still gonna you still have to have the additional data there. But as to, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:32.749Z)

Like how do they use

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:36.012Z)

how does a user

### You (2025-06-02T21:39:37.289Z)

I I think I think you're saying

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:39:37.372Z)

do that I I I guess that you're saying, like, they could expand a and g and you would have I mean, it's kinda it's kinda here, I guess. Like, if you were to expand like, if I were to show you here, Or just go and

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:17.119Z)

So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:20.342Z)

filter on a and g. Right now, I only have expenses. My labor expense, salaries and wages, PTEB, other expenses which are gonna include your brand program freeze and credit card commissions. Right?

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:34.109Z)

You know?

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:34.962Z)

Which are like, you know, way much bigger numbers than all the rest of this stuff.

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:37.019Z)

Yeah. That I

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:40.602Z)

That's so it's like I don't know how you show that, like, but know, if maybe it's maybe it's the same from from a a functionality perspective to be able to show all of this

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:50.189Z)

versus But I think

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:53.112Z)

versus to be able to show just this. But I think the point is that

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:55.449Z)

at least for the first time, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:58.292Z)

at least

### You (2025-06-02T21:40:58.589Z)

only a

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:40:59.372Z)

for the first pass, you know, only a couple of these are really necessary or critical to show.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:02.739Z)

the sort of high level of

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:05.542Z)

From the net from, like, the

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:07.239Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:07.912Z)

sort of highest level of etip from this sort of

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:08.209Z)

Summary. Yeah. We we could always have it. So, you know, they can click on the administrator in general. It opens up and

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:10.952Z)

summary view? So

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:15.949Z)

we could we could just show, like, the program service fees, credit card fees, and then other. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:22.202Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:23.719Z)

And then let them go ahead and and do it that way.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:26.492Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:26.699Z)

That's one Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:31.282Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:32.499Z)

Cool. I will stay there.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:32.702Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:33.949Z)

Like a sample data.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:35.422Z)

Cool. I will save this as, like, a

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:35.789Z)

To meet you. On there.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:37.562Z)

sample data v two.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:38.519Z)

And

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:39.372Z)

On there, and

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:39.739Z)

hopefully, that forward.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:42.632Z)

hopefully, that is helpful and

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:43.149Z)

Makes an obvious

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:46.082Z)

actually, I'll be in Hawaii all week, but I'll I'll still be available periodically if you have questions. I'll try to

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:48.599Z)

Yeah. No. This this looks good. This is very helpful.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:41:51.022Z)

answer quickly.

### You (2025-06-02T21:41:54.369Z)

So quickly so I have to run-in about fifteen minutes. But if you go back to that Teams chat, and take a look at what I posted

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:03.992Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:42:04.439Z)

just before our call. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:09.732Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-06-02T21:42:09.899Z)

Did I make a mistake in the formula? Or is ADR and REV POR basically the same thing? They are same thing.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:19.072Z)

They are basically the same thing.

### You (2025-06-02T21:42:19.789Z)

Okay. The

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:22.602Z)

The the only difference there again, this is a, like, a very technical difference that most users are not gonna even care about. ADR as a calculation is only the rooms you sell

### You (2025-06-02T21:42:36.709Z)

k.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:39.052Z)

And when things are calculated on a POR basis, per occupied room, it is any room that is occupied, which so the difference there is

### You (2025-06-02T21:42:48.119Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:42:49.372Z)

rooms that are given away on a complimentary basis. It's rooms that are given away on a complimentary basis. Somebody's in those rooms and they're using the facilities and therefore incurring costs and maybe buying f and b revenue and other things,

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:06.349Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:06.952Z)

they're just not generating the room revenue.

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:08.489Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:09.362Z)

So that's that's the only difference. We we didn't get into that level of detail

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:11.669Z)

But, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:14.782Z)

but in a lot of the p and l's and and even in our data, you'll see that there's, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:15.769Z)

it's a lot people.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:19.862Z)

rooms sold and then there's a separate slightly separate categorization for comp rooms. So, like, if I go back to the

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:29.779Z)

Alright. So for a proof of concept,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:29.962Z)

and then right here.

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:32.859Z)

if we had to choose one, which would we want? I I know

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:37.442Z)

Just just

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:37.819Z)

Diane has always mentioned ADR. So Yeah. You can

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:42.412Z)

yeah. You just pick ADR.

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:42.609Z)

Okay. So we can just leave POR out. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:45.532Z)

Just yeah. Yeah. You we just you can still call it POR. I think, like, again, most acquisitions people or underwriting people aren't even gonna differentiate

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:58.229Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:43:58.472Z)

because comp rooms are such a small thing.

### You (2025-06-02T21:43:58.809Z)

You know, like,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:01.162Z)

You know, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:01.289Z)

like, migrate up to offer.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:02.982Z)

in in like, if I go down to our

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:04.229Z)

Stat. Here. Like, you know,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:07.122Z)

stats here, like, you know, you'll see here's all the rooms sold. Right? Like, here's all the rooms sold accounts. That total up whatever is the $77,000,000, and then your comp rooms are, like, you know,

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:21.169Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:23.482Z)

60,000. It's just like, yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:24.799Z)

Alright. Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:25.602Z)

Whatever. And it is honestly comparable. It's like a it's like a a small percentage of the overall. So it's a so, again, I think you just

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:28.669Z)

For now, whatever you call it.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:31.672Z)

for now, just

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:32.759Z)

You can do the same

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:33.962Z)

whatever you call it, it's it could be the same thing.

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:34.499Z)

Yeah. If you you same video. You

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:37.382Z)

You can use the same number,

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:37.819Z)

you

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:39.282Z)

for for ADR and per occupied room. You know, if down the room, excuse me, down the road, we would probably wanna separate those out so that a user if they want to put in and factor in comp rooms,

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:49.809Z)

create different

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:51.652Z)

then that creates a difference between your ADR room sold and your

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:55.049Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:56.352Z)

POR rooms occupied.

### You (2025-06-02T21:44:57.769Z)

Yep. Okay. So let me

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:44:58.242Z)

And it's not critical. It's very minor.

### You (2025-06-02T21:45:02.259Z)

oh, what happened here? Think I can get here. Me bring this up real quick. Yep. Need to get to the right page here. Alright. I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show you what I'm talking about. And you'll be the first to see this. So Okay. Alright. So this is what I've been working on is

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:45:55.872Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-06-02T21:45:58.059Z)

the, you know, just kind of the proof of concept. And I've shown this before, so I'm not gonna go through here, but but down is what I had set up a few days ago. You got your rooms, available rooms, occupied rooms, and then this is where you can start playing with numbers. Right? So if I wanna do straight occupancy, I can come over here to my forecast years and just hard input the occupancy numbers, or if I'd rather just do year over growth, I can choose that. And then the row below becomes editable. I can put in, you know, whatever I want down here, maybe 2%, you know, instead of that. And as I go through here, then the numbers down below would would change for the revenue, etcetera, because the occupancy is gonna change. And that all helps with the room's revenue. And then down here, I have ADR, and I have the RevPar. And this is where I was showing the other day too, where you could do the same thing. Flat growth or yearly growth. You know, whichever you choose here is going to choose whatever your inputs are. But notice now I have this section on top which is frozen, to show, you know, KPR cards. This is all made up data It's static. So as I go through and I've changed something down here, it's not gonna change up here yet.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:47:16.042Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:47:17.389Z)

But this is what I've been referring to all along is having some key metrics up here that no matter where I am on the page, when I make a change, I can see the change reflected up here. So I added the ADR, but I also have the POR. And this is what I noticed is like Yeah. There. So so I think what I'm gonna do is, at least for now, because Diane keeps

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:47:38.492Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:47:39.509Z)

talking about the ADR, I think I'm going to just take this POR out. Yeah. I don't even have it here yet. Right? So it's like when I'd looked at this, I'm saying, those numbers are the same. I

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:47:48.602Z)

Yeah. Yeah. You can get rid of that.

### You (2025-06-02T21:47:50.219Z)

didn't know if they were interchangeable terms or if I made a mistake in the formula.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:47:51.902Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:47:54.759Z)

Based on what you just said, it sounds to me like we can, at least now, for the proof of concept. You know, there's a lot of things we'll be adding later that might be one of them.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:48:01.992Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:48:02.879Z)

So Yeah. And I don't have this now, but when I start scrolling down here and we start getting into, you know, the other operated

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:48:09.632Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:48:12.389Z)

departments, food and beverage and expenses, you know, this is going be scrolling a lot. So over here on the left side, know, I'm gonna change this revenue to you know, whatever we wanna call it, whether we call it forecasting, underwriting, valuation, whatever. And then down here, we'll have the group. So if I wanna jump to the food and beverage, can jump on here, but it's not going to take me to another page. It just gonna scroll down here to the food and beverage, and then I can make the changes.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:48:39.132Z)

Egypt.

### You (2025-06-02T21:48:39.739Z)

See the effect of the pages up here, and go on. Okay. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. K.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:48:49.582Z)

Okay. Yeah. No. I like that. Yeah. One thing I was gonna say

### You (2025-06-02T21:48:54.819Z)

Yep. Bye.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:48:56.022Z)

and you did mention this in one of your messages earlier, I don't think anybody responded to it, is that you're, like, like, rev in this case,

### You (2025-06-02T21:49:04.819Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I still have to

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:49:05.462Z)

the way this is set up, revenue does not change if you change ADR.

### You (2025-06-02T21:49:07.959Z)

I still have to go through here and connect everything. I do think if I put my year over year

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:49:09.582Z)

Is that still the case?

### You (2025-06-02T21:49:12.779Z)

growth, let's say occupancy, let's just say if I change this to 10%. Then you can see the numbers up above. See how if when I change the number here, Look at all the the the numbers in that up above in this the same column. They they do change. So if I go you know, night to a %, then you can see you know, the occupied room. I mean, all these numbers change. I have to do the same thing down here for for the ADR section that we have here. Right? So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:49:50.352Z)

Right.

### You (2025-06-02T21:49:50.619Z)

but right now, ADR is just dependent on the inputs that I put in for the revPAR or up here. Right? So it's kind of you know What if the calculations kinda jump around everywhere? But Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:03.092Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:04.879Z)

Users

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:05.882Z)

What do you what I was gonna say

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:06.479Z)

you know, most of the models are set up.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:07.712Z)

yeah. What I was gonna say, the the way that

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:09.249Z)

Is there

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:11.042Z)

users are

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:12.639Z)

to occupancy

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:12.652Z)

you know, most of the models are set up

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:13.019Z)

Yeah. Right? Just now. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:15.342Z)

is you're gonna

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:16.449Z)

Okay. So

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:16.502Z)

your inputs are occupancy and ADR. RegPar is just an output.

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:19.219Z)

you know? Like, punctual,

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:21.672Z)

In all cases.

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:22.109Z)

I understand what you're doing.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:23.102Z)

So

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:23.359Z)

Punctual

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:23.922Z)

no one's gonna

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:24.469Z)

You know, in 2000

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:25.512Z)

you know, like, functionally, I I understand what you're doing and and it and it works, but you know, intuitively, the way users are gonna do it, like,

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:32.079Z)

Okay. I'll put it

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:33.692Z)

that's not how

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:34.219Z)

They're it yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:34.992Z)

the the hotel users are gonna become accustomed to it. They're gonna expect to put in

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:38.129Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:39.782Z)

occupancy You know, what is my occupancy? And then ADR,

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:41.639Z)

Okay. That that's that's an easy fix, and I'm glad you pointed that out.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:44.702Z)

And then that's gonna calculate

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:46.249Z)

Because, again, I was just kind of going off of Mark model that had some

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:46.722Z)

RevPAR and revenue. For for the rooms department.

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:51.859Z)

RevPar inputs.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:50:51.982Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:50:54.239Z)

I kind of thought it was six of one half dozen of another, but it based on what you just said, I'm I'm gonna change it so that the RevPAR then is calculated and the ADR here will have this same type of input. So it'll it'll work the same. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I can make that change. Okay.

### Guest (2025-06-02T21:51:13.662Z)

Okay. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-06-02T21:51:17.119Z)
