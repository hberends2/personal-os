# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### You (2025-09-23T14:01:51.784Z)

Good morning. How are you?

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:01:53.944Z)

I'm good. How are you?

### You (2025-09-23T14:01:54.904Z)

Doing well.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:01:57.464Z)

That canvas thing you did looked amazing.

### You (2025-09-23T14:02:00.504Z)

Yeah, that was the first time I actually used that. What I think I sent it to you either email or teams given the outline of go to Gemini 25 and whatever. The example that they gave was you just put in a question in Gemini and let it come up with the answer and then click a button. So I had to experiment a couple times because I already had the answer I wasn't looking for online. It's like, I want you to take this. And finally got it. But, yeah, I thought that was pretty cool. I think we need to make use of that. With.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:02:41.304Z)

Yes, definitely. When Mark sent that outline last night, I was like, how do you get this on one page? I had no idea. And, man, when you generated that, it was, like, pretty cool, pretty slick.

### You (2025-09-23T14:02:54.584Z)

Yeah, but remember, that's not a one page printout.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:02:58.184Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T14:02:58.584Z)

Yeah, so I didn't try to print it or make it formatted for that. A lot of those infographics would just be a link. That you would include. On your material. You know, send out an email or something on the website. And I have seen a lot of those things just embedded in a website. So, you know, we could have. Make it more feature specific. This is a good sales one, but when we start having specific features or something, you know, they could click here, and then you might have another page open up with this infographic that explains and things like that. But, yeah, I thought that was pretty cool.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:03:46.264Z)

Very good. Very. Mark's engaging, which is good. Right. So that's positive. I mean, he kind of has his. What would I call it, like a coming out or like a sweet 16 or something, like. Or, you know, like on October 6th at the conference.

### You (2025-09-23T14:04:01.304Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:04:03.144Z)

Once he kind of talks about this, it's hard to go back. And so I hope that helps with starting to for me to try to be more proactive with him on sharing ideas on what customers to go after, when to go after them, and how to, you know, fundraise. And I need to do a better job of being more proactive with him on that, so.

### You (2025-09-23T14:04:18.184Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:04:27.464Z)

And I'm hoping that we just put the back burner and then I'm gonna. I don't know if it'll be today just because way today is going, but some information about how to send, how to set up may actually take one of the people he tries to fundraise to want. Something in return if this makes sense for him.

### You (2025-09-23T14:04:42.184Z)

Thank you, Tool and a friend perspective and I worked with a cruise to it and they actually take one of the people. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:04:57.224Z)

To react positively to it. But I do think it could be a salute.

### You (2025-09-23T14:05:02.264Z)

And to. I'll call it. It's the first round of money that raised, you know, maybe just call it a million, you know, over the next year, year and a half. And this is an extra set of cares.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:05:16.584Z)

They can get cash out like we get cashed out on the exit.

### You (2025-09-23T14:05:22.104Z)

So actually.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:05:22.904Z)

I have to sit down on, get it into a format that I can send it.

### You (2025-09-23T14:05:27.864Z)

What means and how it works. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that'll be helpful. Yeah. So. Yeah, I. Yeah. You know, I don't know where this thing with Mike Sherman is going. I hope that we can. Come up with something. You know, I enjoy speaking to him. I think he's very knowledgeable, and I think, you know, he could be. Very helpful. From, you know, legal and advising and counseling type of things. So hopefully we can come to an agreement, but if not.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:06:08.424Z)

Yeah. If he's willing to do the, you know, the 5 million pre money valuation. I mean, for me, like, we just can't accept anything less. Because the thought of someone investing 50k and getting 10% of the company makes me literally sick to my stomach.

### You (2025-09-23T14:06:18.184Z)

Someone.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:06:24.984Z)

Like that can't be the case, given how hard we've all worked for our 20% shares. But if we can do a friends and family pool and satisfy him that.

### You (2025-09-23T14:06:36.024Z)

Would be silly. I think we have to take the 50k at this point. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I just want to caution that we have to give everything a very. Unbiased as possible. Look at it from their point of view. So. Yeah, I agree. I don't think 10% for $50,000 is. Fair. I mean, that's just. It is way out of line. But, you know, 10% for. Or 50,000 for 5%, 3%, that's probably more in line, but. But, yeah, I mean. We all know in real estate, when you go to sell your house, you always think it's worth more than what the market is. Just want to be careful that we don't.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:07:29.384Z)

's.

### You (2025-09-23T14:07:32.664Z)

Overestimate.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:07:35.224Z)

Overthink that we are exit proceeds would be, which is so far in the future. Like, you know, when you talk about like, I can't even think really to the exit, all I can think about is maybe the next couple of years and getting to the next.

### You (2025-09-23T14:07:47.864Z)

Anyone else.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:07:51.544Z)

Speaking of real estate, how did your open house go?

### You (2025-09-23T14:07:54.744Z)

The open house. I don't think anybody showed up. But then we had a scheduled showing right after and they are very interested. They saw seven places, and ours is number one on the list. But they want a place where they can live all summer and there is no longer. In there. It is a weekender. But there are. Two very good options for adding laundry facilities. So we're going to talk about, do we just give them, you know, a couple thousand dollars at closing for them to add it or, you know, what do they want to do? There's one option. That could be done very easy. Very fast. But, you know, it has a dining area, but it also has like a breakfast nook in the kitchen, you know, where it's got built in benches and. If they were willing to get rid of the breakfast nook, you can just turn that into a laundry area. You just. It's easily enough for a side by side. You just have to have one door in there, add a bifold and you're done. And then there's another one that I think is a better you don't lose it. But it actually involves expanding, extending a wall out. Next to one that's already there. So that would obviously be more expensive, but we'll see. I hate to say this, but I was eavesdropping a little bit. I have. I have a ring door, or not a ring doorbell, but, you know, a doorbell there. And we also have a camera on. The deck, but I always disable the one on the deck because, you know, it follows them around. And we don't want to. But I always want to know if somebody shows up. Sorry. They were talking quite loud. I mean, I could hear some of their conversation. And I was sitting here listening to it and like, ok, this sounds good. This is promising. They were like, oh, look at this. Oh, love that. It is.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:10:18.104Z)

Is that. That's positive, though, right, for you guys? I mean, I know you're going to be heartbroken to lose it, but, I mean, maybe there's a better option for you. Maybe you'll have better neighbors the next time you buy cottage, right?

### You (2025-09-23T14:10:29.144Z)

It. 's it is good. I think we rushed into it a little bit. When we. No, we bought it. Yeah. Yeah, I think.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:10:38.824Z)

The selling of it. Or the buying of it.

### You (2025-09-23T14:10:42.424Z)

Had we been a little bit more patient, you know, maybe we might have found something a little bit better.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:10:42.824Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-23T14:10:48.184Z)

But. We never intended to live there. So washers and dryers and all that stuff. Didn't really matter. So hopefully we were looking for somebody like that that was, you know, local. And would just go up there on the weekends, but haven't found them yet. But this one, I think, you know, hopefully we can work it out, so.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:11:16.344Z)

Ay, that's good. That would offer financial relief for you guys. I mean, that's personal, but it's just my concern, as we think about fundraising and, like, how long it's going to take from here and things like that.

### You (2025-09-23T14:11:19.944Z)

Yeah. Yeah. If. If we were to sell that. I could. Drop my monthly requirements down to. 2000amonth. 20, 100 somewhere in that range. Yeah, yeah. Two thousand a month. And. Or a lump sum. Because I just had to pull out more money out of the ira. This week just to cover some bills. But if, if we did have some type of a lump sum, that would just us a little bit of padding. In there so I don't have to keep taking money out of the ira. That would be. That would be good. So this is. This is a good segue. Vinod and I had our one on one yesterday and we. We were talking about all of this. The. The pressure for him to get full time. You and I need income. But some of the conversations we had last week. Regarding owner equity. Payroll. You know, at first we thought 1099 was an option. Then it's not an option. Sounds like having that title of a founder could be prohibitive. For anybody. Getting paid until we get to Series A, and that would be quite a while. So I just made a comment to to Vinod. Kind of was at first just kind of like a snide comment, but then we started talking, which was. Maybe we don't need to be founders. Maybe we just need to be paid employees. You know, if that's going to be an issue, and it's. If it's going to hold. Us back from getting income. And be a red flag to investors. I don't care if I have. Chief of anything in my product, in my title, or, you know, co founder on my LinkedIn profile. I don't, you know, I don't care about that. And that's what I told him. I said, you know, I wouldn't want to lose the equity, of course. I don't know if it's an option or not.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:14:02.504Z)

Yeah, we should look at. I mean, if you. If. What was Benoit's reaction to that? I'm just curious.

### You (2025-09-23T14:14:04.504Z)

Once. Once we started talking about it, I think he. He. He agreed. It's like, you know. I think we're both more in it more for the equity than anything else. And of course, you know, we. We both have put a tremendous amount of time in it. So if you. We don't want to just walk away from the, the portion there. So, you know, whether it's 20% or whatever, and I don't know how that. I don't know how we would do that. Honestly. I think if we were part of a, you know, five person split and everybody gets 20%, I think an investor would see through it. And say, okay, well, why are these guys getting a salary? And, you know, part of the. Founder pool. So I don't know if there would have to be something set up separately or what, but. It might be an option worth looking into.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:15:13.624Z)

Okay? Okay. Yeah. No, yeah, I. Let me think about it. Let me research it. Let me. I have to be careful how I approach Sherburn because I don't have, like, a. An answer for him yet. Right. And so I gotta be careful how much I tax him on work, but I think. Drew's attorney might be able to help us. I'm just trying to think. And there's also things like springing equity or, you know, I mean, there's like that we could document now and. But let me research it because. And go. Feel free to research it as well. I have to figure out, though. I have to pay bills like I don't even have. And, I mean, we've exhausted our retirement already because I've been working on this so long.

### You (2025-09-23T14:15:59.544Z)

I literally have.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:16:00.024Z)

So, like, and you know my situation. So I pay my mortgage, and I have to figure out a way to do that. Even if I'm an employee and a founder at the time. So I want to be careful, to be completely fair to everyone else in this process. You and Vinod. I feel like the three of us have been the ones that it's fallen on our shoulders to create this thus far. And I want to make sure that it's completely fair.

### You (2025-09-23T14:16:27.224Z)

Impossible. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:16:28.984Z)

And very be.

### You (2025-09-23T14:16:29.704Z)

Yeah, I. You know, Jews. Drew has made comments. You know, he's working 10, 15 hours a week, and he follows that by a comment, saying, which is more than I wanted to. And then, you know, when I. When I hear, yeah, then. Then why are you. Why are you getting an equal share if you're only wanting to work 25% of your time?

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:16:43.144Z)

Autiful. Red. What does that mean?

### You (2025-09-23T14:16:52.744Z)

Yeah, if. If.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:16:57.144Z)

I think, to raise that with him, too, because obviously that comment is made to communicate something to us. Right, like you wouldn't say that last part, which is more than I want to.

### You (2025-09-23T14:17:06.024Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:17:08.504Z)

Which it could mean that he's tired of playing middleman between Myanmar. Right? Because I don't think I'm a handful, but maybe I am a handful, and I just am not, you know, recognizing that in myself.

### You (2025-09-23T14:17:12.584Z)

What can we need?

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:17:26.904Z)

Maybe that's why he's saying it, because he doesn't want to have to deal with the, you know, the politics of being in between us. But I agree and in Mark too, like not working that much on this, so. But I don't know how to approach that. And also I'm in a stickier position with Mark. Because we have the same connections. But he does have more senior connections than I do. Does that make sense? Right?

### You (2025-09-23T14:17:50.824Z)

It makes sense. But I think I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Industry partners. Are small. At some point we will be looking outside of the hotel owners and operators. For funding. Even if you know, Take. Take fifth Wall. They invest, but they're not hoping experts. They're investors in. We're going to have to go to. You know, the friends and family is great. Industry partners is fantastic. To get your foot in the door and to get some of that initial investors. But the big money, I think. You know, when we're talking Series A and beyond, we need some. Those. Those industry contacts don't matter. That's. That's kind of what I'm my concern now, and it's unfortunate that we're this far into it and. You know, at least I'm starting to second guess. It's like, why do Mark and Drew get 20% each when Drew is not wanting to put in that much time? Mark is not incentivized to go raise money. You know, it's like hindsight being 20 20. You know, should have been done differently. But I was 100% behind. You know, when we first started talking,

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:19:20.104Z)

Yes. It should have been done.

### You (2025-09-23T14:19:22.984Z)

And you, you know, said, whoa, we've got five. Five people. Be a great team. We've got these connections. We'll do it even, 20 split. And I thought that was fantastic. Didn't even occur to me at the time. What potential issues we may have down the road, so.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:19:44.264Z)

If you. How would you approach that with Drew and Mark? Like, would you just say we need to have a candid conversation about what time commitment you're willing to make to this? Because you have other jobs. And that at some point in the very near future, you invite. Well, we've already been working full time. But we will officially be working. Well, I mean, that's not the right way. It's the right way to say it. Benoit has had another job. And so. But he's still putting more hours in than Drew and Mark combined. Right. So should I just raise it? Like, I just want to make sure I understand what you're willing to commit from a time perspective because we may need to revisit the structure of the llc, or would you do it a different way?

### You (2025-09-23T14:20:31.784Z)

Right now, we don't have an llc, so it's. It's on the table. But yeah. I almost feel like the subject has to be broached, as painful as it's going to be.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:20:52.984Z)

I mean, we could put, like, shares, like, say, the employee pool. Instead of 150, put a few, like, more in, right? And then say, okay, let's reduce your share. But at some point in the future, if you become full time, then you spring to another amount, but it's contingent on, like, you actually, like, putting everything that you have into this. And sometimes in retrospect, I think Marc should have just been an investor. I think he has the affluence to do it, but he hasn't definitely offered that, and I'm not gonna broach that with that particular topic with him.

### You (2025-09-23T14:21:32.024Z)

No, but you know what? I still. I still think.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:21:34.744Z)

But.

### You (2025-09-23T14:21:35.224Z)

That if he was compensated as a percentage of the amount of funds that he raises, He could be if he can bring in, you know. The. If we can start getting, like, you know, the. A million dollars from. An industry. Insider, right? And he got a percentage of that. That would be very enticing. He would get paid up front. And also have an equity position, but I don't think it's 20%. I don't think. Yeah. I'm just struggling that with somebody who.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:22:20.664Z)

You don't think it's 20% okay.

### You (2025-09-23T14:22:22.904Z)

Is. I mean, he's. He's very, very important to this organization. I'm not trying to downplay his importance, but I think his role is limited. And he is not putting in full time hours. So then my, you know, my question is, why is he getting full time equity? And same thing with with with true. Now. With drew. I think a lot of that depends on what we do with Hotel Bis. And if we end up merging the two and he becomes full time, then I think he should be equal amount of equity.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:22:49.704Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-23T14:23:06.904Z)

But. But, yeah, same thing. Because right now he's got his own business to run. But if his business becomes our business. Then he would be putting full time hours in, so that one's a little bit different, but. Yeah, that's one of the things I'm struggling with, so. Up and down a bit like he was having. He didn't get it for a year.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:23:33.624Z)

And drew.

### You (2025-09-23T14:23:35.544Z)

And he's losing, which I think really stressed him out.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:23:40.744Z)

He's losing some. But then he one pilot with admirable and he's working with a company called Rockbridge. And then he's taking this Australian client, and so I think he's feeling more optimistic. Does that make sense? Hotel biz, which is a little bit of like. It's like, now this is where he starts to compete with us a little bit, right? Although not truly relying on hotel biz to process any of the information. So we're not dependent on him potentially raising prices on us because we're processing it. But what we don't have is someone without Drew. We have to go map all of this ourselves. And we need to allocate the not that it's impossible, it's possible to do if Drew did it, it's possible. And I can think of one of their partner that could do it for us. I can think of two other partners that could do it for us. But.

### You (2025-09-23T14:24:44.744Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:24:46.904Z)

Yeah, I'm rambling out loud. I have the same concerns, and I have the concerns around major decisions as well. Because I have been beyond frustrated. Like, trying to come to consensus on certain things and just having one of us say no to it. And that's like, well, wait. You know, one person can't block a decision if four of us agree to it. And then, obviously, I put all my. I mean, I would bleed for this, right? Outside of my kids, this is everything to me. And no, it's not that same. It's fun for Mark, right? It's like a nice, shiny, bright thing that you can go talk to his friends about. But it's different for me. It's like. This is my dream. I want to make this happen. I want to bring it to life.

### You (2025-09-23T14:25:34.344Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:25:37.784Z)

Yeah. Well, can you think about that? Because you are really a very tactful man in the way you bring things up. And so I am all open for advice on how to do it. You're right. We don't have an LLC agreement yet, so it still can be on the table. Right, and we have to go work through the major decision section anyway.

### You (2025-09-23T14:26:00.904Z)

Yeah, yeah. All right, let me. Let me. Let me think about it. But withdrew. I'm not concerned. Honestly. Of whether he does or does not. Merge into Invest if he doesn't. I mean, we. We're going to have data he wants. He's going to have data we want. So I'm not worried about whether we're a customer. We can still partner. And I think he would see the value in that. So I don't think even if his business started to take off and he wants less time with us and more time there, Not overly concerned about that. Mark is the one that concerns me. He seems to have. From what I've. From what I've seen, I. I can see him wanting to pick up his toys and go home. Okay, if this is how it's going to be, Then I'll just stop. Whatever. That's a risk. So I. I don't know. You know, if. If we talk about reallocating the equity, we'll have to figure out how can we offset that. And I, like I said, I think with Mark we could, I think, partially offset it with, you know, basing. Potential revenue off of the money he raised. I don't think that would be a conflict. You know, I. I don't see that as salary. Or anything like this. So, you know, if we raise 75,000 and he gets 7,500 of it, 10%. I don't think that anybody's going to. Say anything, but I don't know. I got it. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. So the minute we check and deposit it, we turn around and give them, you know, whatever percentage.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:27:57.864Z)

Up front. Like front commission on anything he raises. He might like that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's an interesting idea. Okay. I appreciate you bringing it up. I actually have had the same concerns around fairness of it and around major decisions.

### You (2025-09-23T14:28:18.104Z)

You know? Things could get.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:28:25.064Z)

Locked and my ability to work effectively with Mark, which I have to improve, right? I have to figure that out because Mark. I can't go have a conversation with Mark like I have a conversation with you, if that makes sense.

### You (2025-09-23T14:28:34.424Z)

Up.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:28:40.104Z)

Mark always looks at something almost through, like, a psychological lens. And so I have to look at it through a psychological lens. When I approach him on things, I can't be as direct. I mean, I need to be direct. But kind of like how he talks about Dan Lesser when he says, if you go ask Dan Lesser for money, he's not gonna want to InnVestAI. Have to wait for Dan Lesser to say to come to you and say, I want to invest.

What happened?

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:29:05.384Z)

And so Mark's a little bit like that, right? You almost have to think, okay, what to do to get him motivated.

### You (2025-09-23T14:29:07.704Z)

Yeah. And if that's the case, then we start talking to somebody else and we wait. Unless there's other people to talk to.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:29:13.384Z)

For this.

### You (2025-09-23T14:29:20.184Z)

So, you know. We don't want to just focus on one at a time. We should be. If that's the case. So then my question to Mark is, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:29:31.464Z)

Oh, yeah, right. We need. Right, right, right.

### You (2025-09-23T14:29:32.904Z)

Who else are you talking to? Plain and sin, right? Yeah. I don't know. I think the only thing that would be an issue is if the LLC documentations ready to sign tomorrow and we say I'm not ready to sign it yet. We've got some.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:29:46.264Z)

Okay. You'll think about it? I'll think about. It's not because I have something around the buy sell and I have to circulate something around the major decisions. I mean, I see it now. I was too naive in the beginning. I just thought we were the perfect group of people because we all had such different skill sets. I had no anticipation that someone would try to block something that was as simple as giving. Some de minimis away. Right. And the other thing with Drew is, as I read through his, what he calls his safe note, Which is actually, I think more of a promissory note with Actus. He has a key man provision. So he has to work full time. For Actus. Right. And so I don't know that we can put that he's the COO on our website. Because it's one thing for him to be behind the scenes and act as not really know what he's doing. But the minute we put his our COO on our website, that is that he's at risk then I think for them calling him out.

### You (2025-09-23T14:31:07.784Z)

That's something we may want to consider is, you know, we may give him an internal title of CEO, and I might be internally cpo, but we may not want to put titles out there.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:31:09.544Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T14:31:23.544Z)

Yeah, we could. You know, you could always have. You know, here's our team.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:31:25.704Z)

Hi. We want to put titles out there because then.

### You (2025-09-23T14:31:27.944Z)

With a little blurb on the biographies, but. No titles. Doesn't even have to say whether you're full time or you're an advisor. You could be either. You know, this is. This is the startup team. Yeah. I think there's different things we need to do, so I. I will. I haven't done any research on, you know, the partnerships and equity and everything like that. That's. I've been focusing on building products and letting you guys do that, but I can. I can start doing a little bit of. Research just to see what options are there. Like employee versus.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:32:05.144Z)

Product.

### You (2025-09-23T14:32:12.984Z)

Owner and equity and how that could be. Set aside, you know, what are the options? You know, every time we have a call, you know, I hear a different phrase tossed out. It's like, I don't know what that is, you know? So. Myself more on that.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:32:34.504Z)

Right. Right. I think I can. Right, Right. And it's just I am working at Kroger full time. This is the only day I have for the rest of the week. And so I just. I'm not complaining. I just want to get home from it. It's like, wow.

### You (2025-09-23T14:32:48.744Z)

Physical labor actually is. You know what I'm saying? It's like weights, because this is kind of.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:33:01.144Z)

Hard. And yes, it's definitely been a humbling experience and made me think about people that work, you know, labor jobs a lot differently. And the hotel industry. They're on like the housekeeping teams. I'm not getting tangent, but like we reduce them to numbers, right? But they're not productivity. They're people. And we don't often treat them like people.

### You (2025-09-23T14:33:24.664Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:33:32.344Z)

Okay, I appreciate that. And then is there an. And just so you know, I have a list of people I want to go to, or I've already started go to. Right.

### You (2025-09-23T14:33:36.424Z)

I know you, brother. You and I got.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:33:43.624Z)

My right. My problem is the. The pitch deck. It's like, oh, my God, how is this pitch deck going to come out? You know, I've tried to step back and not be so controlling on it. But I have a group of women that are waiting for me to deliver this. I have, like, friends that I want to go to. Like, I want to go back to Peachtree. Right. But I have to be really careful of that because Mark is friends with Greg Friedman. Right. And who's the CEO. And so I need to be very like, okay, this is how we're going to approach Peachtree, right? With with mark. Yeah. And then after that, I have a very clear idea, too, of how we could potentially approach Marriott in Hilton when it comes to writing checks for bigger numbers, if that makes sense. Because 500k to Marriott is like literally nothing. Literally. And if we could help them on things like Pips and, you know, certain other, like. You know, the, the legal workflows they keep talking about, then we could easily raise a couple million dollars between Hyatt Marriott and Hilton. And then that takes us. In my mind. To Series A. So that's why I don't freak out when I think about $4 million. Because I'm like, okay, we can just get to the point where we prove we have a product.

### You (2025-09-23T14:34:59.224Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:35:05.864Z)

Then I will go shake the trees with inside the Berends and figure out how to approach them.

### You (2025-09-23T14:35:07.784Z)

Yep. So for the next six months, the focus needs to be on just the core product. Getting that lender version out tested. And then, you know, after that, the investor broker.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:35:13.784Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T14:35:21.304Z)

I did circulate the. Narrower roadmap. A lot cleaner than looking out through the end of 2027. You know, that first one that I put together was just filled with Gantt lines and hard. So it's more focused on the short term. So, yeah, we have to get that out the door, and it has to be right the first time. But it doesn't have to look pretty. So as long as the. The back end is working great. You know, we can worry about the layout and the colors.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:36:11.144Z)

Yeah. Is that? Gantt chart you for the next short term. Is that in enough shape that I can send it to Carlos Rodriguez Jr. When I send him a safe note today?

### You (2025-09-23T14:36:15.224Z)

I believe so. If you take a look at it and it makes sense to you. You know I did. It's got the key. Everything is color coded by phase and hopefully everything is clear.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:36:22.664Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-09-23T14:36:32.024Z)

If it makes sense to you. Then, yeah. If it doesn't, or if you think something could be improved, let me know. It'll only take me a second to. To change it. So.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:36:47.784Z)

Okay? All right. Very good. So we will talk today.

### You (2025-09-23T14:36:52.904Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:36:54.024Z)

At 5:30 and Mark can't join because of the holiday s so. But Carrie's joining, right?

### You (2025-09-23T14:36:57.224Z)

Okay? See ya. Bye.

### Guest (2025-09-23T14:37:00.344Z)

Okay, perfect. Talk to you later. Bye.
