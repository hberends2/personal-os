# Transcript for: Howard | Vinod weekly call

### You (2025-11-17T22:30:45.521Z)

If. You are. You're muted.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:31:08.401Z)

Oh, no, I was on mute. I think all along. Yeah, I would say I am on my way. I'll be off camera, but I can talk. And then I kept asking, can you hear me, Howard? Yeah. See, I was telling you, these guys, they don't like dying at all. They're very frustrated with them for whatever reasons.

### You (2025-11-17T22:32:02.801Z)

Kind of. Hard feelings as well.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:32:06.801Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:32:14.801Z)

Diane. Suggested last. Week. So I don't know.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:32:27.761Z)

Then the other thing is. I don't know if high confidence on dying anymore.

### You (2025-11-17T22:32:40.721Z)

She's got. Good connection. S. But. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:33:05.841Z)

I think first things you should do is find a good job so that she's out of that desperation. Right.

### You (2025-11-17T22:33:15.361Z)

Do. Something. Like. Going on once. Knowing what diane. Is thinking. I don't think. That's the way. The. Option.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:33:33.121Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:33:35.841Z)

Stay. S. The first. Ever.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:33:43.841Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T22:34:03.361Z)

I. Don't know. Part. Of. Her thoughts. About? That. Trying. To. I guess. I don't know. She plans. On, ask. Ing. Like to. Come on. And help her. Not. Very. Helpful. Make her. Worse way to do that. Because. October heard the very first time I was. Pulling away. A slight man. Exactly. What needs to be done. She works for a vc firm. To call. In. But this is. Like. A. Power. May. It was a long. Time ago. Racing. In. English. Like that. Was. Very interested. I. Think you shake. Hand opportunity. To. Be called. Up. But.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:35:25.521Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:35:30.401Z)

More. Comfortable.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:35:33.361Z)

Who is this guy? Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T22:35:46.481Z)

Probably. Half the main idea.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:35:53.361Z)

Okay? Yeah. That's a good thing. Yeah, that's. That's a new dynamic. We can think of. But right now, whatever is the situation, I'm just thinking how to deal with it because. Things like it's. It's gonna break. Diane is not the agree with what. Rue and Mark is saying. And Mark, Andrew won't agree with whatever Diane is saying.

### You (2025-11-17T22:36:25.281Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:36:29.601Z)

What does that mean for us? That's what I'm trying to understand.

### You (2025-11-17T22:36:33.121Z)

Oh. You know what? I. Require. Different. Politics.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:36:46.321Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T22:36:53.121Z)

On the calendar. Yet. So most likely. She stole. But. Anyway. To. Come along. And have somebody like. That advice a second. Said that would be. Very. Helpful.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:37:15.601Z)

Yep, that will be for sure.

### You (2025-11-17T22:37:17.281Z)

Yeah. In fact. Convers. Ations with her. July. Available. Back. Ground on. That. Call. It by anyway. Had author, but she almost. Drew Lark was on the call as well.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:37:54.561Z)

And mark, okay? Nice.

### You (2025-11-17T22:38:02.321Z)

Her back. Ground is.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:38:05.681Z)

Sure. So she will help with what? Sales and fundraising.

### You (2025-11-17T22:38:18.161Z)

Help. Ful with fundraising. But she'd also. Be helpful for. Diane.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:38:24.321Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T22:38:30.321Z)

Wish. Es to talk about. Time because she was. Incredibly busy. With.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:38:41.841Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:38:44.481Z)

Pfize. R. Mentors, stuff like that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:38:46.081Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:38:46.881Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:38:47.841Z)

Yeah, we don't need a full time. If she could help us with specific things. That will be a great thing. I mean, she's so experienced. She has done so many startups. Part of the problems is like, none of us. Probably true. And Mark has some experience, but they don't also have software startup experience. And then. Part of problem is that as well.

### You (2025-11-17T22:39:28.401Z)

Any. Thing horrible. Times. I've. Got experience. But. Software business.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:39:52.641Z)

If you ask him questions. Or if you try to learn from him and he's like, he just takes it on his ego. That's a problem. Because I also had a call with him. And after you sent those. Replies on each comment that. Like you commented in red. Like you replied on red after. Yeah, after Drew. Etc. So he had called me and then he's. He was saying I am the only one who is business experiency. I know how to do it. I said, yeah. We know you know how to do it, but we need to know how to do it as well, so you got to share with us. Then only we will kind of understand what what you mean.

### You (2025-11-17T22:40:44.001Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:40:44.401Z)

You just say? Yeah, just do whatever I'm saying. I'm not explaining. That doesn't help.

### You (2025-11-17T22:41:03.521Z)

Except. As.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:41:09.441Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:41:12.721Z)

Hback. On your. Form. Was country for. That. 's not going to happen. Either.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:41:21.761Z)

I don't like that idea as well.

### You (2025-11-17T22:41:30.881Z)

Work. At all. Of a sudden. The rug is going to be pulled. Out. And we're done. With the. Group. A younger people.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:41:49.121Z)

One moment, okay? I need to call my wife to send my daughter out. Just a minute, okay? Just for a minute. Thank you. I have to call. Okay, I'll drop and come back, okay? I'm back. Yeah, so. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not on board with going forward. It's time. Without iron. Until we have absolute clarity on what's gonna happen, I don't want to sign.

### You (2025-11-17T22:43:30.081Z)

I got to cut. Back a little bit.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:43:33.441Z)

Right. Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:43:50.081Z)

Now in. Thanksgiving. Benchmar. K.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:44:05.041Z)

Right. Yeah. For me. I'm just concerned how. You observed in payment, and all that will work out because. Right now, I think. Draw and this guy agree to pay. You can hear me, right? Now. We don't sign or we just don't agree. Then how the account? I don't know. Yeah. And diane. These lingering things, whether we're gonna break it or we gonna do it. So this month payment is already done. But for the next month, I mean, not done. True Set. He transferred. It is not reached yet. But from the next month onwards, I know it's not a big payment, but still. Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-11-17T22:45:55.121Z)

Still. Working on it.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:45:55.681Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:45:56.081Z)

But. She's got this bank. Account queued up.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:46:01.601Z)

Four.

### You (2025-11-17T22:46:02.161Z)

Strong. And. She? 's got the account, so opt. Ion depos. It money. But. Transfer. Files. Corpor. Ate credit cards. Everything that we. Need to get started. Automatic. Trans. Fer. At. Any time. Legend. Or. Is it just. One time. Force. Remain to.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:46:57.441Z)

I don't know how. Yeah, I don't know how he set it up because for me.

### You (2025-11-17T22:46:58.081Z)

Morrow.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:47:03.121Z)

I've been transferring using that app for years. And I never had any issue.

### You (2025-11-17T22:47:10.001Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:47:11.281Z)

Like I have transferred any amount. Like 10,000. More than that, live than that. And I never had any issue. He is also transferring to one individual. I also transferred to one individual. I never had such issues. No, it's called remittley R e M I t l y. But once we have the account. Our account, I'm sure, has an ability to transfer international funds. And from our account. We'll just transfer to the Indian company's account. I had some progress on that as well. Yeah, this person has got the name registered. I think there are few more steps left. To get the tax ID and to open the bank account. But. First initial steps are completed.

### You (2025-11-17T22:48:18.161Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:48:21.921Z)

That's definitely.

### You (2025-11-17T22:48:47.761Z)

My issue. As well.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:48:52.801Z)

Since he was transferring from his personal account. He was talking about the agreement or llc. I don't know why Remittal you would ask for that?

### You (2025-11-17T22:49:15.761Z)

Is. Personal account. But I don't. Know. Don't worry about it.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:49:22.961Z)

And who are, like, in more hurry to kind of sign that LLC than anyone else. That kind of keep thinking, like, why are they so such a hobby? In between something. She clearly said she cannot do it for a week or two. That's fine, because GR has been sitting on that for quite so long as well. Yeah. No, it's not one sided. Just please do mess ups. For sure. But yeah, it's not one sided. But now I think they just want it to be signed so that it is. It is there, right? So that you are legally bound to it.

### You (2025-11-17T22:50:30.161Z)

Diane, my future mama. I can see why they'd be pushing to get it done right away.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:50:38.641Z)

All. Right.

### You (2025-11-17T22:50:42.961Z)

I. Hope that. They don't get. Money. Helped. To get this thing started.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:50:53.201Z)

Of course.

### You (2025-11-17T22:51:00.081Z)

Take away. Her equity. She just. Made. And in the. Four of us who run it. Well. I mean, I should. Keep. Enjoying. I don't think. They'll think at 20. Percent each. Don't. Just know I'm hang. Ing. Down.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:51:22.081Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:51:22.081Z)

To that.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:51:23.681Z)

Yeah. I am completely not in favor. Of removing the end from, you know, voting right or anything. I'm just saying, she understanding that, you know, it's not our company anymore. It was her company. If she was doing it alone, right? Now she herself involved as saying you are 20% partner. She should be absolutely clear, guys. Not. She cannot just take any independent decisions in this because she is involved other partners now.

### You (2025-11-17T22:51:58.641Z)

Last week. We all. Have. Control. Ler. Mind. But. Not a. Good idea to have five people with equal. Just. Like, man.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:52:47.201Z)

That's what I also wonder. She keeps saying, I've been working on this for five years. Five years. She should have figured out these basic things. Like, yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T22:53:01.761Z)

I think. She's been working on. The model. Evaluation. Model. And. I think. That's the first time that she realized that. It's doable. Other. People. Think. About the idea for. Five years. But she hasn't. Been setting up a company. For five years, that's for sure.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:53:42.721Z)

But anyways, now, wherever we are, I definitely want. To keep Diane as is. I don't want her to. Invite be cheated on. It's. It's kind of cheating. Like she put us together. Now you're saying just get out. That cannot happen.

### You (2025-11-17T22:54:06.561Z)

That's for sure.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:54:14.801Z)

We handle. I'm not gonna sign that. She put your. Unless, you know. Absolutely clear. Die and is on. We all are. Probably on questions, but I'll wait. Would I come back whatever time it is? One week, two, Three.

### You (2025-11-17T22:54:35.761Z)

We have. That conversation. She needs. To be the last one to sign. It.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:55:09.201Z)

This is the starting of the problem, right? We have to, like, do this throughout. We are doing this work, and that's gonna be crazy.

### You (2025-11-17T22:55:11.281Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:55:18.321Z)

Like every time, we have to take a smaller distance. We don't want to get into all this all the times.

### You (2025-11-17T22:55:30.961Z)

One of the. House I could read about.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:55:45.041Z)

Yeah. I also didn't say. Okay, it's fine. You can imagine whatever you want.

### You (2025-11-17T22:56:08.641Z)

Makeup. It's just. Such a. Denied between them.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:56:20.481Z)

Yeah. Tough and rough day is gonna come. I'm not telling them anything, but probably they can feel I am demotivated.

### You (2025-11-17T22:56:33.441Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:56:44.881Z)

So Shiva made something really cool. He has made a chat bot. Which you can just kind of ask anything based on the documents you have uploaded.

### You (2025-11-17T22:56:58.161Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:56:59.361Z)

It's really working. Good. I'll demo that to you sometime. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I just asked him to do something entire domain because that's what their primary. What I say their motivation was right, because I told them we are making this new technology platform wherein you're a lot of new technology, we're a lot of AI, right? I just ask him to play around and do something, and that's what he has created. So I said, yeah, I think we could probably use that.

### You (2025-11-17T22:57:38.801Z)

Definitely.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:57:51.121Z)

Yeah, exactly. That's what I told him this morning. And I'm gonna share in the AI Agent document that you had shared. And just, you know, research around and see what we could do. So.

### You (2025-11-17T22:58:12.481Z)

Way. Ahead on the road. Map.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:58:16.001Z)

Right. Right. The chatbot is definitely working. I saw that today morning. It is working with multiple documents. It is working with one document, so that's definitely good. Some UI work needs to be done.

### You (2025-11-17T22:58:28.961Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:58:30.081Z)

But yeah, it was giving good response. Yep, yep.

### You (2025-11-17T22:58:37.281Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T22:58:39.521Z)

Other than that, yeah, they could probably. Feel some demotivation from my side. But yeah, I mean they are fine. We do need to put them in the right Berkadia before we lose them. So then most finally already looking outward change because I tell them this cup for couple come on board for a couple of months and see. It's already been three to four months now. So this probably next payroll whenever we are saying. I had already emailed that we need this much amount. So, yeah, just let's lock them because they are doing fantastic work. We don't want to lose them. We don't need lot of seniors and all, because whatever experience I'm getting right now, With these seniors and all, they are probably less performant than these guys. Really. Yeah. Yeah. They might not explain everything very thoroughly and all that, but they are doing really good work. I don't want to stay at Marvin. Really? But I don't want to throw my stable job for this as well. Wherein people are fighting and there's no future, right? Yeah, I'm definitely stable. My job will be there, but I am not very motivated to go there.

### You (2025-11-17T23:00:36.161Z)

Coming in from the valley.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:00:38.801Z)

Yeah, and then I also need to keep my visa alive, and for that, I need my job. So that's the only motivation. But I would definitely like to move out whenever I get an opportunity either.

### You (2025-11-17T23:00:52.801Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:00:54.321Z)

In the CI or somewhere else. Because this one is neither very high paying nor like I am just working as more like an icy role. Which is fine. I'm getting a lot of exposure to data and all that, but initially, I think probably for a couple of months, that was fine. I was like, okay, it's same thing. Create this pipeline, get data from here, merge this data, create a data warehouse. It's same, same thing now. So I'm like, okay, I got the exposure, whatever I needed.

### You (2025-11-17T23:01:25.201Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:01:26.161Z)

And now I'm doing the same thing.

### You (2025-11-17T23:01:27.521Z)

All. Right.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:01:52.161Z)

Yeah, they are aware of it. Yeah, I've told them I'm one of the partners and this is how it is structured. Right. Yeah, that's what my concern is. And that's why I told him, just play around here. I do something here. So that's what they're kind of doing. The other work you must have seen. They've implemented the map. They've almost completed whatever feedback Gru had provided. And then on the other side, they're also doing this.

### You (2025-11-17T23:03:14.321Z)

Now.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:03:16.081Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-17T23:03:16.881Z)

I. Love. How. Document. Ation already. Cog. Nos. At the top. Of the page. Al. Uminum. Page. Coverage. Ratio.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:04:03.441Z)

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:04:45.281Z)

Yes, sure. I mean, we can. We can do that. With do the next. I mean, I just needed to give them something different because they've been doing this. Thing. And I'm that broad. Good result as well, so.

### You (2025-11-17T23:05:12.321Z)

And. Consumers online. Copy. Rights. Issue.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:05:30.161Z)

Yep, yep. Yep. Yeah. So RA is still working on that year zero. Because it leads to extract monthly data, right? So probably a little bit more work. Is working on the. Where is that sso login? That's bit challenging for him. And yeah. I've not been able to support much as well.

### You (2025-11-17T23:06:01.281Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:06:05.601Z)

So he had that. And then there's some environment related issues he's looking into because I think he's done a lot of that work, so I just want him to take care of that. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-17T23:06:27.921Z)

Innoc. Ent account. And once you.

Enough. Time on that. So far.

### Guest (2025-11-17T23:06:37.921Z)

Yeah, yeah, we must do that, because that's the key to get the outside users in. Thank you. That's all. Thank you. See you. Bye. Bye.
