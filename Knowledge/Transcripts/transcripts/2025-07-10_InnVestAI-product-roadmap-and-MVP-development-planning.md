### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:10.985Z)

Hey, Howard.

### You (2025-07-10T19:00:11.686Z)

Hey. Good afternoon. How are you?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:14.755Z)

Good. Thanks for sending over the valuation. And loan update stuff today.

### You (2025-07-10T19:00:24.226Z)

Valuation and loan up update. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't send anything today, but I did I sent quite a few

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:31.175Z)

Maybe was it yesterday you sent it? I looked at it today, but the

### You (2025-07-10T19:00:34.676Z)

so I guess I'm just yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:35.595Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-10T19:00:36.296Z)

Yeah. Hopefully, it works or so. Helpful.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:38.955Z)

Hey, guys. Can you hear me?

### You (2025-07-10T19:00:42.636Z)

Hey, Vinod. Are you there? Barely. Sound very muted.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:00:49.795Z)

Can you hear me? I knew it's gonna be on the listening mode for there.

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:07.036Z)

Yeah. That's that's fine. You're you're breaking up as well. Can you hear us okay?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:11.045Z)

In there.

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:11.606Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:12.625Z)

I can get

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:19.526Z)

Mark. How are doing?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:20.225Z)

Can you hear me?

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:21.706Z)

Good. Good.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:23.995Z)

Good. How are you? Yep. Great. How's everyone doing today? Good. Good.

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:35.916Z)

Oh, Diane, were you talking about the video that I sent today? Oh, okay. Okay. I was thinking that I sent you some documents

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:40.065Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:44.346Z)

and, like, I don't remember any documents on valuation or loans, but okay. That makes sense. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:52.755Z)

The video. Yep.

### You (2025-07-10T19:01:53.766Z)

Getting there.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:01:58.715Z)

We're getting there.

### You (2025-07-10T19:02:30.256Z)

I thought the conversation with Carl went well yesterday. Yeah. Very, very good. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:02:37.365Z)

I did too. I thought she has good feedback. Right? And yep. We chatted with my friend, Kara Munn, who I worked with at CBRE. She was a debt and structured finance broker there. Then she'd also worked at Lowe's for a long time. When I was at Clarion, we did a deal with Lowe's. And she gave us some thoughts about how dev and structure finance people would look at InnVest and some of the things they would want. One of the things she said that was super interesting was know, we've been thinking about and on the equity side, trying to back into certain things, like if I need a 11% unleveraged IRR and da da da, what should I change? She said on the debt and structured finance side, they need to kinda back into it a different way. They need to be able to say say, like, how much could revenue fall and still be able to cover debt service and let us exit out of this loan within a cushion. So it was a it was a really good conversation. And then she also said, she felt like her young financial analyst that she's worked with, they probably know, if they would if they were to go in and try to run those type of sensitivities, that despite modeling expenses on a POR basis or whatever, it might not capture the true flex and flow. And so we talked about trying to potentially use industry standards like, that an operator would use on flex and flow and then be able to flag something if if it didn't look right. Like, if if it was out of what you would expect from a flex and flow perspective. And then she the last thing she said that was super constructive is, like, what do you do if you have a really stream kinda outside of market deal? You know, you don't wanna be doing those outside of investment AI. So how do you create sort of like a catch all page or something? Where you could almost model something from scratch if you had to, like, a condo hotel or a weird you know, just a very weird structure. So

### You (2025-07-10T19:04:53.726Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:04:56.255Z)

Howard? That's pretty that was some of the feedback that she gave.

### You (2025-07-10T19:04:57.086Z)

Good feedbacks. Some of the

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:04:59.225Z)

It was good.

### You (2025-07-10T19:05:00.896Z)

no. Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:05:01.265Z)

Yeah. One thing I mind that that's really sorry to cut you off.

### You (2025-07-10T19:05:04.346Z)

No. I was gonna say it was it was really good feedback, but I I

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:05:05.985Z)

Off. Continue all that go, Howard.

### You (2025-07-10T19:05:08.946Z)

personally, I kinda thought some of it were like, the really outlier or exception type of things. I don't know if that's something they encounter frequently or if she was just thinking of some of those outlier use cases. But anyway, Mark Mark, go ahead.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:05:25.745Z)

Mhmm. Yep. Yeah. No. I I've been trying to think about how to integrate AI into this. Because that, again, is such a big thing right now and will likely be for the first I want to do a little bit of like, do trend analysis.

### You (2025-07-10T19:05:39.246Z)

Oh, yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:05:44.575Z)

So that, you know, for example, if someone's using our model, and they're inputting actual numbers every month, if AI could compare the month over month to prior months in prior years for the same hotel, but then also overlay it and compare it to you know, the market and the competitive set and see if it's a trend in the market or if it's just a trend at this specific asset. And then maybe use AI to project going forward that if that trend continues, you know, will they be a problem at the hotel six or twelve months ahead? Right? Because, you know, asset management with all due respect, is often, like, backward looking where, you know, again, you call in the asset management where there's a problem. If we this is my experience, least. So if you could the AI to predict the future based on trends, both at the hotel in the market. Maybe that could serve as, like, an you know,

### You (2025-07-10T19:06:36.416Z)

Yeah. Yeah. No. That that would be a pretty straightforward use case, actually.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:06:38.925Z)

a valuable tool for ownership to try to effectuate change before the problem occurs.

### You (2025-07-10T19:06:40.726Z)

I think.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:06:43.805Z)

Does that make sense? Mhmm. I mean, that's the kind of thing that we our system, we are working towards doing. Using the data that we have to do predictive analytics that sort of thing. The hardest part has been that you have to organize the data in the right way. Like, and I don't know. I've never worked in any other industries. I'm speaking from a point point of ignorance. Perspective ignorance on this, but hospitality seems to be somewhat uniquely complicated in the number of ways that it looks at things. Like, and, Howard, maybe you can weigh in on this. But, like, I talked to our CTO and our CFO. Was like, we look at things on an amount basis. POR, PAR, percent of revenue, maybe it's per cover, per labor hour, per like, it's like all the and these these to them, they're like, they're like, they it doesn't doesn't seem to connect, I guess. They're like, what's

### You (2025-07-10T19:07:44.056Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:07:44.955Z)

the most important? I was like, well, any single one of them could be the most important depending on which ones doing the worst or what metric you're looking at. And Well, just to play off this. Right? Hotels the the challenge with hotels is that things shift so rapidly as compared to the real types. Right? Because, obviously, you have to resell your hotel every night. Right? So things can change if there's a downturn, there's a problem with your asset, or there's a revenue manager that made a colossal mistake that no one knows about. Until six months later. Right? Like, it just thinks so if we could use AI to to predict you know, daily changes that could compound into weekly and monthly and quarterly and annual changes. Right? Because things happen fast and a lot of times unless people are really looking at things with a magnifying glass, they they may miss them. Yeah. And I think in order to do that, you have to have the data has to be organized in the way that it is used, like, in a way that makes sense. Like, you'd have to have something like, you'd have to have the data available in the data model on an amount POR, PAR, percent of revenue, etcetera, basis. And you have to have the right relationships between all the data types to say that, like, market revenue, is related to concept revenue, is related to property revenue, is related property expenses, those other things. And yeah, I I think it it would be extremely powerful or I should say it will be extremely powerful once it's developed, whether it's us or somebody else. It's absolutely what we're working towards on our hotel BIS side. We just it's just taking a lot longer than we anticipated. And Well, hopefully, it's Yeah. And I don't and I don't know if I mean, like, and how maybe you or who know you guys to speak to this. But, like, our our system is built in a what what my CTO says is is a unique way. It's it's an analytical system. It's like a multidimensional analytical system that it, you know, requires you to be, you know, very the data has to be really, really well organized for it to work. Versus, I think, like, other types of models which are called, like, relational or tabular models. Or maybe not tabular, relational models, which maybe, like, don't require as much organization. You know, they're easier to just spit out reports, but they're not as good for AI. I think that's what most of our competitors use, like single pane and profit IT and and profit sword. Right? They use these simpler models that are easier to easier to maintain and spin up, but not as good for

### You (2025-07-10T19:10:06.776Z)

Yeah. No. No. It it does make sense.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:10:10.535Z)

big picture, massive analysis, and AI.

### You (2025-07-10T19:10:11.556Z)

One of the concerns though is

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:10:13.765Z)

Maharaj, is that correct? In any way, what I say made sense?

### You (2025-07-10T19:10:15.836Z)

you know, I I I'm taking what I heard as some type of a trigger or an alert. Where the data is forecasting, know, maybe you're gonna fall below your debt service coverage ratio that's in your loan document or something else And I understand that these things can change nightly, you know, if you have a you know, concert that's canceled. Right? You're gonna have people order some special event So the only way we could do that would be by getting data on a more frequent basis. You know, right now, I would think that for the asset management position, we're or product, we're we're looking at monthly data. Right? And even that would be helpful to if you're if you're looking at a long term trend But I guess it just depends on what alert do you think we could we could give. And if and and how frequently could get that data. You know. I do remember somebody mentioning that there are some organizations that update data daily, Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:11:32.125Z)

Yeah. We get data from Amadeus. TravelClick Demand three sixty is a common revenue manager product. That gets some crossover utilization into asset management and real estate. So we have we have one customer that takes that data, and we integrate it for them. It comes it's daily level data.

### You (2025-07-10T19:11:50.386Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:11:52.755Z)

So it's the next three hundred and sixty five days of reservations compared to the last three hundred and sixty five days of reservations. And then it comes twice a week.

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:00.746Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:02.435Z)

And it's, you know, it's it's like first 15 hotels that Sunstone has, it's like a million rows every two day two, three days. So it's a it's a lot of data. Compared to the

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:11.996Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:12.795Z)

financial data that we get, which is more like you know, we have 250 to 300 hotel

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:15.616Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:18.455Z)

that probably all in every month total a 100,000 or a 150,000 rows. So it's, you know, it's a lot more data. I think I think there's use cases for both. I think an asset manager is supposed to be bigger picture.

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:31.056Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:32.265Z)

Could get a lot of benefit out of what you the example you just provide, which is, like,

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:34.306Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:36.645Z)

am I go you know, am I trending below my debt service coverage ratio? Right? Or or am I gonna trigger a performance test or not for But, Drew, the day the data that you're referring to, is that just top line? Is that rate and occupancy, or is that just rate. Full? Yeah. It's just rate and occupancy. Right. Yeah. Proposure does have, like, more frequent

### You (2025-07-10T19:12:54.156Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:12:56.945Z)

Like, you could pull data every day if you wanted, but the expenses are not necessarily that useful until the accountant updates. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T19:13:05.466Z)

Yeah. No. That that yeah. That's

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:13:05.765Z)

That's all the invoices. Many I mean, Howard, just for your your benefit, you may not know this, but

### You (2025-07-10T19:13:10.146Z)

common in multifamily.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:13:10.705Z)

mean, typically, a management company doesn't report on the prior month

### You (2025-07-10T19:13:11.476Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:13:14.975Z)

until, like, the third week of the following month. Right? So you see you're always you're always, like, a month behind. Best case,

### You (2025-07-10T19:13:15.886Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:13:23.005Z)

And then they make adjustments later. So that it's just anti it's an antiquated system. One of the things we talked about with Kara that was really interesting because she put her broker and her lender hat on, is that we we have the ability to pull the operator's forecast. And most operators do a pretty good job of forward three month forecast because they're measured on it from at the management company level. It's usually not until midyear where they scrub the second half of the year when they're getting ready to start the budget process. So come July, you can have some pretty big changes to the second half of the year. But we did talk about the idea that you could start to use forecast information as well, like, in the transaction process. She had she had a good reaction. She's like, oh, she's like, brokers are gonna hate that. They won't like that at all. She's like, lenders would like that, brokers will hate that. But then we talked a little bit about the idea that you know, sometimes if you're a broker, you do get put in a bad position if your owner is not giving you good direction about where the NOI is headed, up, down, right, if trend is gonna continue. Kinda mark to your point that maybe asset managers might not be on top of it as much as they need to. And that could impact the advice the broker gives to the client Like, if you have a hotel where you have NOI declining, declining, declining, you may choose to take a different bid. Right? Bay a bid that maybe can tolerate more risk in the NOI, but might have a higher rate or lower proceeds or something like that. And it was just it was just interesting because it it did bring up the the view that brokers will hate forecast information but maybe there is a way to pitch it to them that it could be helpful to them in their sales process as well. Yeah. Although the reality is that a lot of times owners and or brokers think they're being

### You (2025-07-10T19:15:23.866Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:15:24.145Z)

clever by not giving updated information if it's not good. But, ultimately, if they don't, in due diligence, the buyer just retrades, and then everyone just gets pissed off. That's what she said. It doesn't really help anyone in the end. Yeah. Yeah. So I think having real time data ultimately will be better for everyone. And right, Drew? I mean, I I feel like as an asset manager, the forward three month is good data if I mean, because they're measured on it, and they need to be within a certain percent. And and and the AGIs and the Davidson's and the, you know, the institutional quality operators take that very seriously. It's just hard to forecast anything further than three months out unless you're a large group hotel and, you know, you're yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Am I do I have that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Who was it you guys met with? Karaman. She's a friend of mine. She and I went through CBRE at the same time. I was in advisory. She was in debt and finance. Brokerage. So she was married to Russell Munn. I don't know if you guys know Russell Munn, but they got divorced a few years ago. We got over. Right. Alright. Well, where do you guys wanna start today with Should we start with the data piece that, the three of us discussed? And then and go over that with Vinod and Howard. Is that a good place, or did you guys already talk about that? We did not. That's what I was thinking. Maybe starting with what I sent out the other day.

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:07.686Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:10.455Z)

So Howard, Bruno, did you guys have a chance to look this over This is what I sent out the other day. And it's not I none of it should be new. Right? Like, I tried to organize this into the sort of component parts from a product perspective.

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:31.546Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:32.025Z)

Like, I guess, you know, features really. This is the one we've been working the most on so far, like, all the stuff

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:37.756Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:39.715Z)

Howard, that you've been doing is really about the pro form a

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:39.886Z)

Hey hey, Drew. Let me jump in real quick. I uploaded a copy of this

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:42.085Z)

model, the ability to model within the system.

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:43.986Z)

to the team site and made some changes

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:46.215Z)

So most of this is

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:47.006Z)

on it. So if we wanna take a look at

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:48.405Z)

already done.

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:49.836Z)

kind of a unified version, I I

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:17:51.415Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:17:52.696Z)

sent out an email with a link. Let me see. Let me take a look.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:18:05.125Z)

Is it in the

### You (2025-07-10T19:18:06.616Z)

What was the name of the file again?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:18:09.415Z)

development tab, or is it where is it?

### You (2025-07-10T19:18:12.006Z)

Yeah. Okay. So if you go into the InnVest team sites, it's under the development and product folder.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:18:19.525Z)

ABM product road map.

### You (2025-07-10T19:18:31.106Z)

So what I did is I I just basically took the

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:18:35.415Z)

I got it.

### You (2025-07-10T19:18:36.396Z)

worksheet there that you've got open, the product tools. That's the that's the spreadsheet that Vinod and I have been working on, and I just integrated it into this version. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:18:57.055Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:18:58.496Z)

Yes. Yeah. It is. I I see that you copied it.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:00.045Z)

Yeah. And I the thing that the video sent out

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:02.876Z)

Yeah. If you go back to the page that I added, the the product tools, there's a lot above that.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:04.315Z)

it's the same pieces that I put

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:09.056Z)

Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:12.335Z)

here.

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:12.766Z)

we didn't add any of

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:14.325Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:15.086Z)

the nodes costs into this. But there are some items here

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:18.395Z)

Oh, okay. Got it.

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:21.686Z)

a little bit more detailed than than what we have in there. Some of the subscription. Tools that we're gonna need. Yeah. We can we can we can roll it into there.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:38.765Z)

Okay. Yeah. I think my thought was that

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:40.126Z)

I mean, it's not all technology. It's some of it. It's just

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:42.865Z)

this all of that

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:43.876Z)

something we're all gonna use, but yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:44.065Z)

you know, technology related things should get put in here.

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:46.486Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:50.405Z)

Yeah. Or or or even

### You (2025-07-10T19:19:50.926Z)

Right. K.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:19:55.895Z)

well, I mean, everything that's product related So not, you know it wouldn't you know, not QuickBooks, Gusto, what a payroll, you know,

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:02.496Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:02.915Z)

and operational systems, but any and not like I mean, unless

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:04.876Z)

Well, actually, if you take yeah. To

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:06.695Z)

I guess, like a CRM or something,

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:08.166Z)

take a look right above that area, that that product and operations

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:09.235Z)

I would probably put put somewhere else as well. But

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:11.396Z)

I'm I'm pulling the total annual number.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:12.795Z)

just the product related

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:13.966Z)

There. So so I so I did link the worksheets. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:14.805Z)

technology. And you can even just make it one line item if you want, like, in here one line.

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:17.956Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:19.485Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:24.076Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:25.965Z)

Then that that works good.

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:27.336Z)

And so that's that's the that's the annual amount.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:27.515Z)

Okay. That's what I figured. Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:31.176Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:31.485Z)

Then yeah. Then that's fine.

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:35.886Z)

Which ties to that very

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:35.955Z)

And is this the total amount or the

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:37.646Z)

top number in row one.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:38.225Z)

month?

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:39.026Z)

On on the other sheet. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:20:39.195Z)

The this would be total for, like, for it would be for a year. Okay. K. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Then okay. Well, that's good. I guess,

### You (2025-07-10T19:20:58.096Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:21:00.265Z)

what we what Mark and Diane and I talked about the other day was continuing on the conversation of you know, how is the data going to get into the system? In in the case where Hotel BIS or some kind of API isn't option. And I think what we settle on is while we will continue to pursue you know, getting APIs and getting data loaded through Hotel VIS, where that's not gonna be something that's gonna happen right away. So there need to be there needs to be, you know, a a simpler, you know, operationally simpler method And so the the most basic one was, like, somebody has either some kind of Excel that they upload or

### You (2025-07-10T19:21:49.756Z)

So so

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:21:51.595Z)

you know, some kind of form that opens up

### You (2025-07-10T19:21:53.266Z)

yeah. Let me ask just just for my clarification because I I thought I heard you say

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:21:53.695Z)

on the web page they can enter in. And you will revenues and expenses and statistics,

### You (2025-07-10T19:21:58.086Z)

getting the data out of HPIS.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:21:59.275Z)

for each year.

### You (2025-07-10T19:22:00.556Z)

To InnVest, but you're talking about

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:22:00.585Z)

You know, and then you save it and it gets loaded. That would be, like, the simplest. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T19:22:03.146Z)

there's no APIs or anything for the users to upload their data. Right? Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:22:19.655Z)

Right. I'm saying that that for a significant right? Like, if if you think about it, like, there's sort of two use cases There's the case where somebody already owns a hotel or they're maybe trying to and they're trying to refinance or sell it. Or just get a value right? Like, in that in those cases, they they can go to their operator or maybe they are the operator and they could say,

### You (2025-07-10T19:22:36.446Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:22:39.725Z)

release the data, put the data into Hotel BIS, and it will get loaded, and it can match, and then you get and then InnVestAI can pull it from hotel BIS.

### You (2025-07-10T19:22:45.786Z)

Right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:22:47.955Z)

That's that's easy. Other use cases where somebody is looking to buy a hotel that they do not already own. Right? In that case, data is going to come from either a seller or a broker, but it's it's not it's likely at least not in the near term, it's not going to be structured data. It's going to either be a bunch of p and l's or you know, mean, yeah, that's what it's gonna be, a bunch of P and Ls. Right? So there needs to be a way so, like, there needs to be probably a couple of way couple of options for how work that data would get into the system. One would be somebody types it in, like, a a form that they can open up in the in the user interface that they can type in. Revenue, you know, departmental revenues, statistics, expenses, and then save it. And then the other option would be that you use the PNLs that are provided as part of a you know, by the seller or by the broker. Part of a deal process, and you load those. But the and the challenge with that is that you know, they're all a little different.

### You (2025-07-10T19:23:45.616Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:23:46.055Z)

So either each one would need to be carefully you know, the system would need to know how to each one carefully. Like, this row is

### You (2025-07-10T19:23:54.896Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We we've we've talked about extracting the data. That's not

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:23:56.525Z)

room revenue. This row is F and B revenue. This you know, right, like,

### You (2025-07-10T19:23:59.766Z)

that's not gonna keep me awake at night. That's that's not

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:24:00.165Z)

or or we could use some kind of AI to

### You (2025-07-10T19:24:02.406Z)

too much of an issue. That's exactly what we did at Run IQ. I guess my question is,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:24:04.905Z)

know, streamline and automate that.

### You (2025-07-10T19:24:07.936Z)

in your second scenario where you've got a buyer or an investor who gets that data from the broker, from the seller, etcetera. How do they get it into HPIS today? Or don't they? Okay. Okay. Right. Right. That that's what I thought. I thought that's where InnVest would come in and fill that gap.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:24:32.355Z)

They they don't.

### You (2025-07-10T19:24:32.956Z)

Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:24:34.015Z)

That's not something we do. We we don't deal with the with that use case. We don't we don't do that. Yeah. Correct. So yeah. And I I think the reason we have been having this conversation the last couple days

### You (2025-07-10T19:24:45.376Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm comfortable with that.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:24:49.475Z)

is because we want to make sure that it is that that use case is addressed in the MVP. Right? Yeah. Hey, Drew. Can I ask you a question? Would would your contact at Starwood Capital because I'm guessing they look at hotels all the time from different operators. You think they would be willing to random like, go just spend a little bit of time and go pull, like, 20 different hot just one p and l from the different operators. And shoot them over so that we could test how easily AI can read the summary panels. Do that. I have fifty or 60 different operator P and L formats

### You (2025-07-10T19:25:27.226Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:25:32.555Z)

I can provide. So Because that wouldn't that be a good use of our time to be able to say that we've tested how AI can actually read summary p and l's and that it reads with x accuracy. Yeah. I think when when the time comes, absolutely, we can use all of the data that we have for Hotel DIS because we use the summary PNLs or the detailed PNLs to validate. The data that we get. Right, that loads that loads from the

### You (2025-07-10T19:25:55.326Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:25:57.255Z)

the the data files, the structured data files. So, yeah, we have tons of those But you've got it in their form. Right? Like, we were looking at that ATI form the other day and, yeah, Okay. Yeah. So we can absolutely use that. I just wanna make we just wanna make sure that we're

### You (2025-07-10T19:26:09.576Z)

Alright. Yeah. So so let me tell you where where

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:26:10.875Z)

I guess what I was wondering is, like, is that how much, like, mean, is it doable?

### You (2025-07-10T19:26:14.526Z)

are now. I mean, obviously, Vinod and I have been doing this for quite a while.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:26:14.825Z)

Is it complicated? And, you know, how much time and money will it take to do? Is it something that we need to

### You (2025-07-10T19:26:19.156Z)

I also have a couple of connections

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:26:19.965Z)

that that needs to get factored into this budget number here?

### You (2025-07-10T19:26:24.126Z)

that were creating a competitor to Rede Excel based, and they were having tremendous success just using AI out of the box. Uploading a document, and saying basically, it just gave them a list of the fields. Here's my so it'll be, like, here's my room's rent. Food and beverage, and then we can break it down in dependence. And AI can do a really good job of just comparing the description on the document that you upload to that list and and does a good job mapping. And taking it one step further, OCR capabilities have come a long way. And I know that there are some processes out there that will

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:27:11.955Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:27:15.206Z)

you upload an Excel statement and it will convert it to a PDF. Because reading the the PDF that is out there. But the node was extremely involved with we when we were purchased by Radixx, one of the very first things we did is we started to improve and work on the document processing. And so he's been doing that. I've been working a lot on the AI side, and then that's why I I don't wanna come across as overconfident or cocky, but to I this is, like I this is something that I don't think is going to be an issue and when I talked to Diane, way before I even met you guys, you know, I I was under the assumption that that was a core feature that had to be in place in order to even go out to the market. And I've been thinking of it that way since day one. So, yeah, I fully expect to have an automated process. What I didn't wanna do I

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:21.365Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:22.676Z)

yeah. Yeah. The only thing I didn't wanna do is replicate something that's

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:25.335Z)

That's great. Because Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:27.956Z)

existing. Right? So if if InnVest is partnering with

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:28.055Z)

K. Good. Because it because it it it

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:31.366Z)

HPIS and HPIS has a process,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:31.495Z)

it it would be, I'd say, yeah, a core feature or it ideally should be.

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:34.526Z)

I don't know if InnVest needs to replicate what you have. Right? But maybe fill in the gaps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:48.525Z)

Yeah. They're different. Yeah. I agree. And they're

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:51.106Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:53.325Z)

they're different processes because what we do is is extremely, extremely granular.

### You (2025-07-10T19:28:55.126Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:28:58.225Z)

It's like mapping chart of accounts level detail to a master chart account.

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:02.956Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:03.125Z)

So, you know, hundreds or thousands of rows, that you've mapped very, very, very know, granular. What this this other process not granular. It is meant to be very high level, maybe 20 to 30 rows Initially. Right. Initially. Yeah. And then as as progresses,

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:21.746Z)

Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:23.155Z)

this is the way it's working with all of our customers. Right? Like, as the deal progresses, usually, when they get to the going hard, right, like, to to being under contract,

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:28.846Z)

Right. Okay. Alright. I think we're all on the same page. I'm not I'm not

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:31.665Z)

the seller, broker, operator, whatever is willing to release

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:33.236Z)

worried about that.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:35.765Z)

structured data to us. That's when we can start to pull it into the system via our usual process.

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:41.126Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:44.485Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:29:44.766Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:29:47.565Z)

Cool. Awesome. And just to be clear, so that doesn't won't necessarily increase the cost or timing that we're talking about for this POC to VP period. When should we test that, though? I mean, are we at a point now that in the next two weeks, Drew, you could pull those 50 p and l's and we could

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:03.716Z)

We do have some files that, Drew uploaded.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:06.955Z)

and and Howard and the node could test pulling them up via AI and

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:10.446Z)

Back when we first set up the teams. I think under

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:12.215Z)

did and document processing.

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:14.416Z)

which folder did we put that in?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:14.645Z)

This is a reminder. I

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:18.076Z)

It's not under the yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:26.975Z)

Yeah. They they to your question. Yeah. I I know I did I did give you a bunch,

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:32.056Z)

Well, no. We we just need sample

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:33.695Z)

I would think that we would need

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:35.756Z)

data.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:35.935Z)

the

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:36.566Z)

PDF, Excel,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:37.885Z)

you need the a m AI model, right, in in place, whether it's

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:40.396Z)

whatever these people are using

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:30:42.795Z)

whatever it is that we're gonna use

### You (2025-07-10T19:30:44.736Z)

for underwriting. If it's if it's a summary level or whatever, I just we just need financial statements, whatever they would process to get that historical data. Yep. Okay. Yep. Gotcha. K.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:05.995Z)

Okay. Yeah. Here. So it's in valuation model development financial statements. I started to put a couple of them in here. So each of these the hotel is first, the operator is second. And I can add a bunch more.

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:19.386Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:20.715Z)

And they are

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:22.166Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:22.455Z)

right, like, really what we're trying to get

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:23.686Z)

Yeah. So in this situation, you could

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:24.995Z)

I mean, I I hopefully, it's really obvious, you know, how

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:27.306Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:29.335Z)

ties together, but it's you know, from DocuSign.

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:33.516Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:34.845Z)

Yeah. This page here. Right? And I think you have to pull it up by month too

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:38.146Z)

When I when I was when I was testing

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:40.325Z)

the I mean, even though we annualize it, because as you're going through the process, you're

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:40.936Z)

the various AI tools, and I tested quite a few of them,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:31:44.545Z)

constantly recalcating the trailing twelve.

### You (2025-07-10T19:31:44.826Z)

If you just tell it say, extract the name of the property, the date, the number of units, you with multifamily. I mean, all of this information And then and and it was a monthly statement. It wasn't an annual. And it would come up and it would find, you know, here is my rent. For January, February, March, and it would export it in a JSON format that you can just quickly upload into a a database. So because of the standardization of these and from what I've seen looking at the ones that you've uploaded here, I don't see a

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:32:23.935Z)

That's two problems.

### You (2025-07-10T19:32:24.206Z)

terrible amount of variation you know, rooms rent is rooms rent. It seems to be fairly common. So so when you in when you create the prompt, you just put in room rent because or rooms rent because that's what we're gonna call it.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:32:40.545Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-10T19:32:42.566Z)

But you can just say as part of the prompt, you put in but associated or or similar prompts could be room. Like I see here on the screen or, you know, put in the various alternatives to help GPT map it. But it it'll do a really good job on its own. It's it's it's good enough to match and and determine, oh, well, room must be room for it. So

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:11.625Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:17.316Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:19.645Z)

Yeah. But I think we can

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:20.936Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:22.615Z)

try to provide some like, I think there is a specific p and l from each operator or each

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:26.986Z)

And do you ever get them in PDF, or are they almost always Excel?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:30.025Z)

system that is going to be the one that we should say

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:31.386Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:32.835Z)

like, is the default. Yeah. So okay. We certainly do get them in PDF.

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:46.306Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:46.375Z)

I feel like most of the time, you can request Excel. Like, I

### You (2025-07-10T19:33:49.146Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:33:52.335Z)

I guess I'm PDF. I always say just send send this to in Excel. For a in a broker, you know, acquisitions, transaction process. I mean, Diane, Mark, what do you guys think? Is it how often do you get getting stuff in in PDF 10 five, 10% of the time? I would say it's more like 40, 60. I mean, I could there's a lot of stuff that comes through PDF.

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:12.276Z)

Well,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:14.345Z)

Just financial state just financial statement. Mark, what do you say?

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:18.246Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:18.825Z)

I think it's most my experience is mostly Excel, but

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:21.496Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:22.405Z)

I don't know what's the specific maybe 70, 30. I don't know. And I guess it all I guess it probably depends on some extent, like, who you're dealing with. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:30.526Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:30.795Z)

the brands, more sophisticated hotels and operators are gonna they're they're gonna know to do things in Excel. The the

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:37.576Z)

Well, yeah. Well,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:38.475Z)

mom and pop of the world. Right. Yeah. The independence of the world are gonna

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:40.706Z)

yeah. Here here again, I'm not I'm not concerned about the format.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:42.515Z)

they're just gonna run a PDF with QuickCooks if that's what they're using. So but I I think

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:45.846Z)

Know, Excel and PDF are very

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:46.675Z)

we can

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:47.496Z)

very common, but

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:48.235Z)

maybe make an assumption or just start with Excel and and go from there because I think that is going to

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:48.776Z)

with the tools available today, the the the gentleman I'm I'm referring to is a a is a guy that and he might

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:34:53.175Z)

the journey.

### You (2025-07-10T19:34:54.956Z)

be willing to help out with or at least tell me the specific tools, but he's even got it so that you can take the PDF that you get from the broker And, you know, typically, the offering memorandum is gonna have a line item very high Right? This is what the broker put it. He can know, take a screenshot of that page of the PDF and and upload the data. It'll it'll so

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:35:24.025Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T19:35:24.766Z)

You know, it it can use compute Yeah. Computer computer vision. So yeah. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:35:34.425Z)

That's what deal path does. They use the OMs and they scrape them. Yeah. Mhmm. Okay. So That's exciting to hear. That's good. So we're good on data. Right? For now? I think, yeah, we

### You (2025-07-10T19:35:53.916Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:35:54.405Z)

mean, for as far as, like, our path forward, yeah,

### You (2025-07-10T19:35:58.096Z)

Yeah. Whatever you got.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:36:01.935Z)

Howard, do you want me to start loading? Do you want me to start, like, putting more

### You (2025-07-10T19:36:03.306Z)

Yeah. I'd like to you know, if we get at least maybe

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:36:05.625Z)

PNLs on that in that folder?

### You (2025-07-10T19:36:06.456Z)

20, 30, altogether trying to trying to see how many different formats are out there. Right? I don't need 20 or 30 from the same client. I'm talking about me 20 or 30 altogether. Of Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definite definitely wanna get some of those that I I don't think I've seen there.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:36:35.645Z)

Okay. And I'll try to put a bunch of STR reports think I think I was going to do that a while ago and that I never did, but I'll put some more SDR reports on there too.

### You (2025-07-10T19:36:42.846Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:36:45.225Z)

They are yeah. And they they are all the same

### You (2025-07-10T19:36:46.566Z)

Yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:36:50.565Z)

like, pretty much they're pretty much identical. That's You know, I'll put a bunch out there, but you'll see they're all almost exactly the same or exactly the same.

### You (2025-07-10T19:36:59.776Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:37:03.335Z)

Hi. Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:37:04.606Z)

It says yeah. K.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:37:11.875Z)

Wait a have a note ask a question? And nobody yeah. It'll be an API. Yeah. Like, we will create an API. But, again, like, these are different different use cases. It'll be a yeah. For MVP, it'll be an API. So we'll have standard API that you can pull

### You (2025-07-10T19:37:38.476Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:37:40.265Z)

data from. So for hotels that are loading data through our system. Like, they're just able to pull it when it's when it's processed. He's typing out a question here. So Yes. Let me see if the API yeah. I think we have one now that you can use. I'll just give you my admin credentials. So I think oh, one other thing that we talked about where's my sheet here?

### You (2025-07-10T19:38:41.276Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:38:41.515Z)

It's sort of on the document

### You (2025-07-10T19:38:42.216Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:38:43.185Z)

or document storage. Side of things. I what I was trying to get at well, Howard, did did my email to you make sense? So Diane, Mark, Mike, what I was going back and forth with Howard on, and I think we've sort of talked about as well is that at least, I I firmly believe that, like, just saying document storage that doesn't add any value because there's tons of documents that was, like, Dropbox, SharePoint, Box, whatever it is, Right? Like, and I pull data right now from a bunch of different file sharing platforms. But the thing that I think we would we should do that will make us unique is provide some, organization and structure specific to hotel real estate to that file sharing system. So Well, can you also say that we're we're we're doing document storage to aid in the you know, AI, you know, analysis of trends and, you know, to tie it into sort of our AI Yeah. Well, I would say this is Infrastructure. This is separate from the, like, financial statements and loading system into a data model. This is, like, getting your when you're doing due diligence and you're getting, contracts and agreements, like, third party things. Yeah. They're all yeah. There's like, I I pulled up what I shared with, Howard was, like, a deal a a deal sheet There's, a due diligence checklist from one of my old companies. Right? You got these due diligence checklist with a hundreds of items on them, and people load this stuff into a into a shared folder or the broker does. It's just like somebody into the broker room, and then you gotta go to broker room, you download it. There's no connectivity. Right? It's all just, like, some poor person that's, like, make sure that every single file on here was was put into That is the analyst on the owner's side. Yeah. It is a painful, painful process. Yes. So

### You (2025-07-10T19:40:41.986Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:40:42.885Z)

what I was my sort of what I articulated to Howard is that we should provide a standard checklist of you know, all the things we can think of that people want to get during a due diligence process. And a user should be able to open it when they create a new deal. They can open up that checklist, and they can check off all the things that they think they they are going to need as part of this process. And then they can either put either, like, an an email address, a name, or maybe a person like, a rule, like, buyer, seller, appraiser, whatever next to that. And then they can trigger like, an email that will go out to those individuals to say, you know, here are the things that as for this deal, for this customer, person, buyer, whatever, you know, these are things you need to submit.

### You (2025-07-10T19:41:26.806Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:41:29.835Z)

Submit into this box, this email, whatever. And they get submitted, and this is will then take all of those submissions organize them into your shared, you know, like, file storage thing, and it will also update your checklist. So you you know, no person has to, like, monitor what's been submitted. They could just look, oh, I can see all these things are coming in. My checklist is checking things off. Fantastic. And then you layer AI on top of it to say, you know, the system can read those documents, make sure they are what the user says they are, and, you know, summarize or abstract them, for the, for the customer as well. And then just imagine two years in the future, right, if people are using this for asset management as well, then these documents reside or they're getting as changes are being made, annually to contract and service agreements and stuff like that. So Yeah. In the future, this should all reside on InnVestAI and be a much easier process than it is today. Yeah. We we actually have a contract like, module that is set in development, but it's just not we haven't like, many things that we've done. We started it. We just haven't gotten a chance to finish it, but you can upload contracts, and it will tell you, you know, this vendor, the title of the contract, cost, other attributes associated with the property. And then you can, you know, click on a particular contract and and you can actually see the document This is a nightmare during a transaction. Like, getting this operators are busy getting them to this is like It's a nightmare during asset management too because a lot of times, a lot of these service contracts are never right, like They just go month to month, and no one can find the original. This this one basically, like, it it will organize all the like, if the hotel user submits all of them, and then it will tell you, like, what's active, what's expired, what's about to expire. And you can set it up so that it'll notice it'll, you know, notify asset manager and a DOF or whoever that a contract is about to expire, then you take it out to rebid. You can even take a look at your entire portfolio and say, like, oh, across my portfolio, I'm paying a ton of money to this vendor or that vendor. For in the you know, individually from each hotel. Maybe I should go to that Maybe that go to that vendor and be like, look. Consolidate my pricing and give me a better deal. Lots of things you can do Mark sold, Mark sold then lease a company, oh, probably and his analyst, Eleph and I, we had to have spent three weeks on this. Hilton was the seller and the manager we retained Hilton, and they couldn't even give us these. It was just the biggest brain sock of life force. So I really hope we can over time, do a you know, help improve people with this because it's a it's a

### You (2025-07-10T19:44:20.736Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:44:21.175Z)

ugly, awful process. And how how many times do find the actual copy, and then you realize it's not the executed copy? It's not signed, and then no one and then no one knows if it was actually the last version or a you know, interim draft. We should say executed version as opposed to just copy of management agreement.

### You (2025-07-10T19:44:36.796Z)

Spending spending hours in front of the coffee machine.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:44:39.675Z)

It's always a fun thing to do with the closing table, realize you don't have the last document.

### You (2025-07-10T19:44:41.316Z)

Feeding the coffee machine.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:44:43.475Z)

Yeah. So I remember in the old days when they had to bring everything over manually, you walk the lawyer's office, and there'll be, like, a table of of folders, and every document was in the folder. Fond memories of that. Yeah. Yes. And the cock machine always broke at the worst worst possible time. It was a paper jam. Howard, again, quest the question to this is then,

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:10.206Z)

I'm I'm gonna let the node address

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:11.025Z)

how much of this is

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:13.226Z)

I know he's got a bad connection here, so he may have to

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:14.395Z)

is this already in what you and Vinod are planning? You know, is there additional

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:16.076Z)

come may may have to circle back on it. But

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:18.405Z)

cost we need to consider?

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:19.316Z)

document storage, yes. I remember

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:19.895Z)

Can all of this be done for an MVP? Does some of it need to be done in, a, you know,

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:22.036Z)

on the property details, I've got the drag and drop for the property photo.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:24.025Z)

a a later version?

### You (2025-07-10T19:45:26.836Z)

It'll be the same thing. So from a storage standpoint, you know, it yes. So there probably will be some cost in involved depending on the size of the documents and how we manage that, but I'll need the node to kinda weigh in on that.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:45:59.385Z)

K. And this is this is yeah. That it starts to cross over the stuff that Hotel BIS has worked on, but hasn't you know, we haven't been able to sort of, like, finish. So as far as, like, the the ingestion or or and organization and creation of a checklist, that I think, we have not we we were not planning on doing that because it's not really asset management per se. It's the same way it is, like, due diligence acquisitions related. So that, I think, we should absolutely prioritize. That's kind of these first three. And then this fourth one, I'm I'm as we continue to do this, I'm more and more of the mindset that there's going to be less to hotel BIS and InnVestAI are gonna less be two separate things and maybe two things that you know, one sits on top of the other or underneath the other. Maybe we can get I need to talk with my CTO and see where this

### You (2025-07-10T19:46:58.586Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:47:01.585Z)

contract stuff that we've developed is because, again, it already reads the contract. It does all the abstracting. You can ask it questions and do all kinds of stuff. So that would be nice if we can just leverage what we've already done there. To to power the AI part of this of of the

### You (2025-07-10T19:47:15.126Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:47:17.695Z)

this. So

### You (2025-07-10T19:47:20.926Z)

No. No, sir.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:47:23.185Z)

let's think about how that would work. But, yeah, that's kind of something I'm that that's what I ideally, we can, you know, again, use what we already created here. So okay. And then as far as, like, professional grade out sorry. You you wanna say something? Yes. And then as far as, like, professional grade outputs, I think this is mean, we have to come up with some templates, obviously, but I think other than that, it's pretty straightforward. And then portfolio management, pipeline management, I mean, a lot of that sort already in what the node has created as far as the overarching like, landing page for a lot of this. And then the last thing as far as sort of the pro form a model, that Diane mentioned that was, I think, a very useful idea that we have not talked about, Howard and Vinod, is that the other thing that users do when they do underwriting is a lot of times they will they will do their underwriting and as they are playing around with their right, like, revenue assumptions, or expense assumptions, they will want to look at the comparable metric from within their own portfolio. Right? So if I if you're underwriting, right, like the Marriott in Boca and you own the Marriott in, like, you know, like, Fort Lauderdale, you know, you're gonna pull up you might wanna be like, okay. I wanna pull up the Marriott in Fort Lauderdale and see how it like, how is it performing on a you know, POR, PAR basis for rooms expense, whatever. And so you end up with a sort of and again, like, where and how somebody does that You know, maybe it's on this page. Maybe it's on a different page. But but being able to do that is very useful for people doing the underwriting and kind of reviewing after the fact. And operationally, what we were thinking is that that's a provides a huge incentive for customers like a Davidson or Sunstone or whoever to give us the data for their existing, you know, owned and operated hotels. Which otherwise we like, if somebody's using this for new acquisitions, there's not really a whole lot of incentive for them to give us data for new or excuse me, for the owned and operated hotels.

### You (2025-07-10T19:49:46.526Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:49:51.635Z)

So and and in this case, for that that would all go through Total BIS because that would all be structured data would come through at a very granular level. We would load it into our system and it would get you know, you would just pull it via the API. So maybe that's a good time to pause because that's a really important thing to have. But should we talk about, like, where the POC ends and the MVP picks up? Because we're getting pretty close to having a really good POC. And I think, Howard, you had the idea of we can show people what the POC looks like and then also have coming attractions like this is these are the next three features on our road map when we get to the MVP. So I just wanna, like, have a conversation about at what point does the POC end, and then we have these coming

### You (2025-07-10T19:50:36.286Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:50:38.435Z)

so people can see that this is all coming and and then because that right. We in order we need to get into the I think Vinod just said we need cloud access to start to do some of that type of stuff. I think that's first thing we need to do is we I think what we talked about the other day is we would have to test this POC. Right? So Mark, you know, Dan, me, and maybe one other user test this piece to make sure every all the calculations are correct and things As it is right now. Right? As it is, it exists today. Right. Right. I mean, when Howard says he's done, to the extent he wants to be done or keep doing things. I think this goes back to that you know, the diminishing returns here. Like, how much more

### You (2025-07-10T19:51:25.186Z)

Now?

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:51:26.145Z)

does Howard, how much more do you wanna spend working on the PFC versus having us start to test it

### You (2025-07-10T19:51:27.686Z)

No. I I I I'm still working on the on the POC. There's

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:51:30.815Z)

and then move know, and then and then move over to that to the, you know, developing the MVP

### You (2025-07-10T19:51:32.656Z)

there's a couple things. I mean, obviously, I out the video earlier today.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:51:36.065Z)

in a you know, more robust

### You (2025-07-10T19:51:38.196Z)

But the like like I've said before, the POC is internal. That's for us

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:51:39.705Z)

tool.

### You (2025-07-10T19:51:43.956Z)

to make sure that we're heading down the right road. To get the MVP out, we have to have the items that Vedode has mentioned. We have to have an a cloud account. We have to have the ability to set up author authorization or authentication for

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:51:58.915Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:52:01.746Z)

users. Right? Username, password, keep everything separate. So I want to caution everybody. Again, remember the skateboard to the Rolls Royce analogy. An MVP is little more than a skateboard. So we when I when we talk about document storage and all of those other things, those are the nice to have. You know, we we have to segregate the must have from the nice to have. And that's not always easy because people have pet projects or pet features that they wanna have. But the question is, does that have to be there? When we go out to beta testers? MVP will just be beta testers. It's gonna be your friends. And the people you trust and the handful of maybe I'm only I'm only talking maybe maybe a dozen people. That are actually logging in to test it. And what they're going to be testing for is, will this give me the valuation that I'm getting from my current Excel models and will it do it accurately and quickly? Then we can start tacking on some of the other items as we're going through You're not gonna get everything all at once. If you wanna wait to get everything all at once, you know, we'll be releasing this in 2026. Right. So yeah. Yeah. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:53:50.145Z)

Well, we we have that chart that we worked on the other day with those five items. That we thought were, like, our key points. Drew, do you have that chart? The the thing? Key functionality. This is kinda I put together Yeah. Yeah. So this is, like these are some of the things that we thought These are gonna be important. Are we solving? Yeah. Like, what are the pain points we're solving for? Yeah. Yeah. I I think these pain points are like, not they don't it's not it's not, like, one to one, like, with what the features are that we're developing. I mean, it's close. Or maybe, I guess, maybe it is one to one with the features we're developing. Right? Data ingestion, is this first pain point The pro form a model is this second pain point. And so on. I think for the as far as what gets done first, I think you kinda go in order like, you you we're gonna work down the list. The the data ingestion and the form a doing the underwriting, I mean, those are the first pieces that anybody's going to test. This is just my thoughts. Diane, Howard, or, and Mark, you know, feel free to disagree. I think, you know, data model and ingestion, then the pro form a piece, right, by doing your projections. And then after that, it's either the professional grade outputs, the document storage, you know, portfolio and pipeline management, Right? But these first things are the outputs. And then in my personal opinion, we could probably put the rest into a coming attraction. Even the pipe even the pipeline management stuff because we are really, like, looking to, like, the deal pass and the deal clouds to replicate a lot of what they're doing just purpose built for hotels, and then ultimately in a way that can integrate for enterprise users. So it it's like we can those things exist, and we can kinda point people to say these exist, and you can they're buildable and we will build it. Right? But the one thing we don't have yet, right, is the the output page, which is that one page we all look to that's got the the form a and the returns and the sensitivity analysis and and and, like, a little bit about the property itself. Right? And and that you know, we all have a summary. Everyone has a summary page that they look at.

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:23.826Z)

So so I'm gonna push back a little bit.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:26.925Z)

And I think that one that summary page is probably that and then

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:27.806Z)

And and I think what Minod is putting in the chat,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:31.235Z)

the a five a five year pro form a with some

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:34.266Z)

First, Vinod and I were we'll we'll we'll all have to see

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:35.585Z)

historicals on it. Those two things, I think, are the outputs that we need for the POC.

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:38.986Z)

how long is it gonna take for us to develop this.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:41.095Z)

That's my opinion. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:43.356Z)

And number

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:44.075Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T19:56:44.296Z)

number two the purpose of the MVP is not to get the final polished product out. So in terms of printing out those reports, I'm gonna push back out, and that one, I'll push back hard.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:56:58.975Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:00.356Z)

You know, if well, the the we'll have a visual in the map some some rough ideas, but it's not gonna be something that they probably don't wanna take screenshot of. Or anything else. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:18.435Z)

Printing or creating the visual?

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:18.756Z)

Something like that. But not intended for printing.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:21.105Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:23.326Z)

Right? Printing is a whole different project that can yeah. It sounds simple. It sounds simple, but it's not.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:28.965Z)

Okay. You mean it'll be something like

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:30.256Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:33.265Z)

it'll be like you're talking about these sorts of outputs like what we have on the page here. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:36.066Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:37.025Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:37.746Z)

Alright. So so I've I've talked about the difference between the POC and the Let's talk about the difference between the MVP and version one.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:41.795Z)

I think that's okay. Yes. Yes.

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:45.056Z)

K. M MVP is basically what I described that we

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:46.535Z)

Right. The idea I agree. Printing, whole different thing. Just to

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:48.886Z)

we need a handful of people to sit down in a room and plug in numbers and make sure it works.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:57:50.365Z)

show that we thought about what an out paid what an out page looks like. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T19:57:53.836Z)

That's an MVP. K? When we go to market and we start calling

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:58:00.775Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T19:58:02.026Z)

other people that aren't personal friends. Right? That we when we wanna start getting business, that's when we have to take a look at you know, do we have a a a a document upload process plus categorization Do we have a way to print a a package for an investment committee report? There there's in fact, I I'm gonna share the screen here real quick. This is something that we absolutely have to get a call scheduled probably beginning of next week, maybe. Let me see if I can just get this window up. So that way you can see the screen that I'm sharing. Okay. Alright. So these are the little things that we talked about. K. And there's also the Trello board that's got a few things that I haven't copied over here, but yeah, we're gonna have to go through this line by line. And so you know, sensitivity

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:59:14.505Z)

Yep. Yep. Got it.

### You (2025-07-10T19:59:15.936Z)

analysis is something that Kara brought up yesterday. In our call. Is that more important than, for example, AI market research, or is that more important than document storage? Because we can't do it all at once. Right? So there's gonna be version one, There's gonna be version one. And then version 1.1. Version 1.2,

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:59:39.355Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T19:59:40.456Z)

version two, So is what we call agile development. Where you keep going over and over every couple of weeks, every month. You just keep adding things. So we may not have something now, but in two weeks, we can get it.

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:59:54.775Z)

Yeah. I think I think it's yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T19:59:57.236Z)

Or four weeks if it's a larger thing. But you keep going

### Guest (2025-07-10T19:59:58.035Z)

I mean, may maybe I mean, document

### You (2025-07-10T20:00:01.706Z)

piece by piece, LEGO bricks being put together, Because, like I said, if you wanna wait until we have all of these things put together, and then go out to market it will be 2026. Before we can get all of that put together. We just don't have we don't have 10 developers working for us. We don't have all this that we need. So Yeah. There's a there's a couple tweaks, but yeah, Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:00:51.545Z)

Got it. So it kinda sounds like the POC ends

### You (2025-07-10T20:00:53.936Z)

Right. So for the MVP,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:00:54.945Z)

now kind of right after you do the few things you wanna do.

### You (2025-07-10T20:00:57.076Z)

you know, we would want somebody to be able to

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:00:59.495Z)

Then internally, we test it, and we we make

### You (2025-07-10T20:00:59.816Z)

drag their financial statements to the historicals, have them process

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:03.475Z)

sure we can get to a five year underwriting that

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:05.356Z)

populate the model with the historical data, let them go through

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:07.335Z)

produces the same value and returns as it does in Excel. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:09.576Z)

and put in their assumptions for the revenue and

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:11.645Z)

And then that's what we have. And then from there,

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:13.676Z)

expenses, occupancy, all that stuff we have.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:14.695Z)

and then from there, we we just have to think about what our next steps are. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:16.806Z)

In the POC, put in all those finding, seeing assumptions, etcetera,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:19.275Z)

right.

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:22.006Z)

and it comes up with this is the value. And does it that that's it. Yep. Yep. Yep. That that will be the MVP. But it's not what we go to to you know, That's the m that's the MVP. The MVP is when we up when we go outside of the five the people on this call.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:48.235Z)

Right. And that and that's the most important thing.

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:49.526Z)

So if if Carol wants to test it or

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:52.515Z)

Because then we've showed that we've got we've got the data down, and we've got the accuracy of the numbers down.

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:53.526Z)

the the other gentleman that we spoke to a couple days ago, those could be

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:01:57.485Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:01:58.236Z)

the MVP testers. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:02:01.625Z)

Wait. Is that the POC or the MVP? I'm sorry.

### You (2025-07-10T20:02:02.316Z)

That's the skateboard. If the skateboard doesn't work, you can't go on to the next

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:02:06.595Z)

That's the MVP. Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:02:07.286Z)

step. Right? You gotta get the four wheels rolling and be able to turn left and right, and that's about it. Right? Then we start adding some of these other things, so there will be a gap between the MVP

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:02:18.645Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T20:02:19.786Z)

and version one. That's when the node will be coding and will be

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:02:24.405Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-10T20:02:25.506Z)

adding these other things, the document uploads. The other things that we when we go through this list, and we score them, That's going to determine the order of which we get these out. And again, we don't have to get all of them out. We could go say, okay. Well, if if what we really need is document storage, and, sensitivity analysis, before we can go and start talking to people at conferences or other market come you know, what whoever we have. That's what we'll be working on to get next. And then once those are done, we move on to the next one. You know, some of these may take days, Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. It is.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:27.825Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:30.496Z)

Yeah. And and and I I I agree.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:32.055Z)

Well, I mean, I do I do think

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:33.696Z)

And and neither one of those examples are

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:34.435Z)

yeah. I mean, I do think that the the sensitivity analysis and the AI piece

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:36.026Z)

are that difficult. Sensitivity analysis is just another formula that we have to add in there.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:38.535Z)

is super important because I think to go to go out

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:42.196Z)

Another page with table, a few other things. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:43.765Z)

in this environment without some kind of AI

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:46.626Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:46.775Z)

angle

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:47.836Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:47.845Z)

just will look

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:48.766Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:03:49.415Z)

foolish. Mean, just to be blunt.

### You (2025-07-10T20:03:53.836Z)

Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. So so I I I just you know, I I don't wanna be, you know, the one pouring cold water on everybody's host. What we have to we have to talk about, we're listening

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:04.595Z)

Yeah. Because, I mean, that's really the basis for the five year that's

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:05.736Z)

what resources we have and and how you develop and release a SaaS product.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:09.475Z)

really the basis for the projection. Right? You're comparing

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:11.246Z)

You know, you you do it incrementally

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:12.375Z)

hotel with market or a comp set. But then the AI piece is just

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:13.866Z)

you keep building one on top of the other until eventually

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:16.515Z)

you know, what people wanna talk about these days.

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:17.196Z)

you're up here. If you think about it like stair steps, right, you know, Yeah. Yeah. I I I think we are.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:43.055Z)

But but but but just just to continue,

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:45.836Z)

And and most of that falls in the nodes

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:46.255Z)

so do we now have a sense of what capital is needed

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:48.886Z)

camp. Right? It's gonna be on his shoulders because now it's

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:50.165Z)

to get to this sort of MVP? I mean, I know we started the conversation with that

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:52.656Z)

it's we have to get the technology part. We have to get the the

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:55.135Z)

today, but

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:56.156Z)

the

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:04:56.275Z)

you know, do we now know, like, what you know, because we talked about sort of doing a friends and family raise and

### You (2025-07-10T20:04:56.586Z)

core servers, the the databases, all of this stuff that we

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:00.775Z)

you know, passing the hat around. So

### You (2025-07-10T20:05:02.136Z)

need to even

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:03.135Z)

are we at a point

### You (2025-07-10T20:05:04.166Z)

begin working on the very first thing.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:04.305Z)

that we understand that as well as we can?

### You (2025-07-10T20:05:06.906Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:08.025Z)

And, you know,

### You (2025-07-10T20:05:08.946Z)

So so what I've been doing in the POC is not something that we could have somebody outside of the five of us log in and start working on. We have to get that on those externals. Database servers, etcetera. That's what we would need to get started. And and that's not a huge number. That we have in the budget. So Hello? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:56.925Z)

It's, like, I mean, less than $10,000 for

### You (2025-07-10T20:05:57.236Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:05:59.965Z)

the next three, four, five months, however long it takes. But it sounds like

### You (2025-07-10T20:06:06.936Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:06:07.165Z)

mean, maybe our next meeting should be to start reviewing this list and putting these things I mean, I guess, making sure that we agree on what each of the things I guess, I'd say the features, right, that we're gonna be how we're going to name and define them in this list and then make sure that then prioritize them, for development. And also, was gonna say, Mark, we I think even the very first, you know, feature or one of the first features, you know, getting you know, loading data in via these If somebody drops the P and L, right, and then I think that that will be AI. Right? So we'll be able to say right off the bat that there is AI in, you know, organizing and standardizing the data. You know, later on using AI to do trend analysis or make projections. Right? Obviously, that's more exciting than just loading data.

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:06.276Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:07.885Z)

But, but, yeah, I guess, we'll to we'll have to discuss

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:09.446Z)

I just this morning,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:12.725Z)

how you know, where that would be on the list.

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:13.386Z)

Red Sweet Nargle,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:14.515Z)

Yeah. And maybe what we can do is

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:14.526Z)

And then I'm gonna put a couple things in the chat because it really hit me.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:17.435Z)

we started speaking with users, we could sort of have a

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:19.146Z)

As far as

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:20.645Z)

almost give them a road map of what we plan AI

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:21.446Z)

what what what are AI features?

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:24.055Z)

and then we can say what's available now and what we plan to have.

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:24.656Z)

That that are in going into a product. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:27.165Z)

Over the next three months or something like that just so we can show them that it is in progress.

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:27.736Z)

It's not necessarily having a chat with ChatGPT or log or whoever you're using.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:07:32.975Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:07:35.336Z)

It's not always a back and forth thing. And then like what Drew said, just just some of the back end processes that we have in place utilize AI. You know, the the quote that I just posted in there is, like, the users you know, it's not they don't wanna think, am I using AI? You know, it's just we AI, we are using AI. To make the process easier, faster, and more accurate. So you know, a lot of times, they won't know where is AI in this process. But is it making it easier, faster, So Yes. Yeah. We do need to make a a that list, and and I know Vinod had to drop. I I he's not on the call, which is too bad, but I'm just gonna go ahead and and say, you know, we are at a point where

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:08:43.635Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:08:47.426Z)

we need to know how much for node can put in.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:08:51.615Z)

Alright. So I thought that we could start to talk about this

### You (2025-07-10T20:08:52.806Z)

Right now. This is my full time job.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:08:54.895Z)

on our next meeting. Is that

### You (2025-07-10T20:08:56.796Z)

No big deal. But for him, I know he's got other hours and and

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:08:57.795Z)

correct? Yes.

### You (2025-07-10T20:09:00.616Z)

you know, when we talk about how long is it going to take to get from the POC to the MVP with know, when we do get the servers and the databases and get all that hooked up. How long is the node gonna need to take what I put together and convert it into

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:09:18.625Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:09:19.136Z)

the tool that we can get out. And yeah. Yeah. So I don't know what is bandwidth is currently. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:09:46.315Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:09:49.946Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:09:50.685Z)

Like, a how many hours question. And then so it's yes. Is it if it's a thousand hours, do you do a thousand hours in

### You (2025-07-10T20:09:52.086Z)

Yeah. And and and we have to broach the subject with him as well that, you know, he did put in a small amount of money in the budget for a junior developer offshore.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:09:59.425Z)

you know The cost. Think we have to put it in the the cost. Cost. Yes. But it's also, like,

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:02.726Z)

And the money that he put in there is is is

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:04.065Z)

if the project takes a hundred hours, you could finish it in

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:06.476Z)

think it was only 500 a month.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:07.465Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:08.446Z)

Is is

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:08.615Z)

five days if you work twenty four hours a day.

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:09.486Z)

probably pretty accurate.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:11.635Z)

Or you have people working twenty hours a day, or you could finish it

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:11.656Z)

Based on you know, what what are the wages in Hyderabad right now.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:14.865Z)

six months if you only work, an hour or two a day.

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:16.576Z)

I don't think that's that's not gonna that's not a full time, but

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:17.305Z)

So that's that's where the the time duration to your question.

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:22.656Z)

yeah. It is. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:37.155Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:42.356Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I would

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:47.065Z)

But how do how do we manage that?

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:47.826Z)

yes. I I did, but it's a little bit of a different

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:48.965Z)

How do we manage that? I mean, that was in my prior

### You (2025-07-10T20:10:51.746Z)

scenario. So I've I've had teams in Hyderabad Manila, and and South Africa or South America. I'm sorry.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:10:53.065Z)

venture. That became a real you know, we had a dozen people you know, in, you know, India and different places, and it just it became a a real challenge just to

### You (2025-07-10T20:11:00.876Z)

However, they were

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:11:03.135Z)

manage them. And we ultimately found out that a lot of them were

### You (2025-07-10T20:11:03.776Z)

employees of the company. They weren't contractors.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:11:06.485Z)

actually weren't doing anything and still billing us, and it it just became, like, a growing issue every month.

### You (2025-07-10T20:11:09.716Z)

So you know, they were working in our office.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:11:11.455Z)

I mean, do you have do you have a good experience in doing that?

### You (2025-07-10T20:11:13.946Z)

So we we didn't have the problem with observability and and holding them accountable. But I have heard you know, that that's that is an issue. In this particular case, the node set as it's somebody he knows, somebody he's worked with. So that is enough to make me feel comfortable that at least he would have another set of eyes working on the code. I don't see it as a as a full time position. Maybe maybe it will be. I know. But yeah. It can be It it could yeah. Yeah. No. You're absolutely right. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:09.245Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:15.646Z)

Yeah. No. I I think you you've experienced hate to say it, but that's probably more common than

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:20.715Z)

I just I just wonder if it's if it's worth paying a little bit more and having it done

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:22.076Z)

than what my experience was, right? Not a lot of companies have

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:25.035Z)

locally so that we could maintain

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:25.846Z)

and and this was RealPage and this and and couple other companies that are

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:27.615Z)

better cost I it just

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:29.556Z)

large enough that have

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:30.965Z)

I just don't you know, I don't need to, you know,

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:31.916Z)

foreign offices. Right? If you've got brick and mortar in a in a company

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:33.355Z)

be you know, but I just didn't know it was a problem in my prior venture, and we were just

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:36.706Z)

and they have to show up, be

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:37.575Z)

spending money and we lost control of it. And then we found out

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:37.996Z)

that's that's fine. That's no different than having

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:40.655Z)

that it wasn't being overseen as we thought it was, and

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:41.726Z)

having an office, you know, in in the next state.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:12:43.725Z)

it was a big problem.

### You (2025-07-10T20:12:45.066Z)

But yeah. I I I I I I'm not that comfortable.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:13:16.255Z)

Drew, is it would it be a completely crazy idea for us to ask Google if because they have an office. Right? Like, if they could help us with this and we pay them, but they've already got something set up. Is that I mean, that's probably a terrible idea. We need that at this point. It's not like we're doing a lot of like, a ton of work. I think it becomes more difficult when you are look talking about a team of people Okay. Right? And that's why companies that have teams of people you know, overseas usually have somebody that goes there. And, like, every two or three months, they go there and they make sure that people are working and things are happening and and they build those relationships. If you just have one person, I I don't think that that's necessary at this point. I I think if if you guys are already pissed, though, I'll go into the budget And and there are actually two high level budgets I did. One, that has a much lower drop, like, for over the two years has a much lower founder draw and one that has a market founder but I'll just go into the the lower budget first. And I know we only have, like, 10,000 in there, but let me try to pull up some of the administrative costs and some of the travel costs so that we do kind of have a better estimate that from

### You (2025-07-10T20:14:38.166Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:14:38.885Z)

August until December, at least, that period of time, what money it is we think we need.

### You (2025-07-10T20:14:42.166Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:14:45.315Z)

To to do some travel, to attend the conferences, to I have to just go back at likes I guess we're gonna have to set up our insurance, you know, some of the admin stuff as well. Because if we're gonna go out and do a friends and family raise, we might as I mean, we might as well if we're gonna go ask for $10,000, we might as well go out. I'm I'm I'm totally making numbers up here, but we might as well go ask for a $100,000 to get us to the end of the year. If we can clearly delineate the things that we need to spend on. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, if it's $10,000, it might be, you know, enough that we could collectively contribute. Like, I could contribute some of that. Right? Like, I don't know about others, but it's a 100,000, that's a different story. I don't think we need I think, like, for this let's say, whatever, four month period, right, when we're developing this MVP, I don't think we need really any of this. I mean, even like, Hotel BIS has templates for all of this that we can use. We don't need to spend a lot of money or really any money on any of this, but we do, you know, eventually need to have it. Same with sales and marketing. Right? Like, my company, we we don't do a lot because I mean, they you know, we're still developing, but it's like, you know, most of it's just like we we know the people who are marketing to. We don't need to hit high-tech and the, you know, SDR data conference and and, you know, all the investment conferences. I mean, that you know, at some point, we do, but, at least initially, right, like, did did a lot of these costs are gonna come more like you know, down here, like, next year sometime.

### You (2025-07-10T20:16:20.266Z)

Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:16:21.795Z)

Right? So But but let's just see if I could just remind us. You know, I agree with everything you said, Drew. And and I would, you know, potentially willing to to contribute as well. But I I just think that what we need to get to is a point where we get letters from CBRE Davidson, and one other saying, love what these guys are doing. If they keep going down this path, I will absolutely pay them for pay them something for services. Once we have those letters, we're in the game. So we just need to get to that point. Once we get there, our fundraising efforts will be materially enhanced. Right? So so let's just, like, if we could just I find that if if we sort of work incrementally and bite sized pieces, it becomes less overwhelming. And we just have to get to this point where people are writing letters saying they like us, and they'll pay us at some point if we continue down a path. And I think to, you know, to that point, like, I put in four months I think the node said three months. So whatever. Three, four, five, however many months it is. Maybe it's again, it probably depends on how much time the node can put towards this. If it's ten if it's $10,000, I feel like that's something we can probably handle internally. If it's 50 or a 100, that's a different story. Handling it internally, obviously, is a lot easier because it you know,

### You (2025-07-10T20:17:40.656Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:17:43.695Z)

doesn't require us to go ask for money and and and it's just less complicated. But if and then that would get us theoretically, that's what gets us to the MVP where we can start to go to a like Davidson and a couple of other groups and be like, here's what we've developed. Give us your give us your thumbs up, your know, your letter of recommendation, you know, your approval, what and your feedback. And, and then we can take that to investors. Right? So I mean, with that letter, we can the Angel Investor Group, I think, will be very excited about this. Yeah. And I and I think prior to doing this, I mean, like, we need QuickBooks probably. That's 30 $50, $60 a month. I mean, a bank account. We don't need pay I mean, again, like, there's some maybe some of that. But I think it's there what in addition to the technical cost, we'll you know, it's $5.06, $7,000, some labor. Right? You know? And then and then I I think that question each of us needs to answer is do any of us need compensation during that period? You know? Deno, Diane, Howard, probably looking at you guys most because you guys don't have the other jobs that Mark and I have right now. So you know, and if and if we do need to add something to that that to to the total amount, right, to the 10,000 or whatever for that, then But but I do think though that I mean, because Phoenix is right around the corner, and Phoenix is such a potentially good opportunity for us to hit people with, like, some conversations and things like that. So I, like, I think that that conference is important. I I do think it could be a good idea for maybe Mark here in New York for you to go to to Critax just because of all the innovation that's happening in the It's a pretty affordable conference, especially if you don't have to stay overnight and and, like, you're in the city. Like, there are things come fall that I think we should be doing. And getting need. External business. And so like, I just know when people have called on me in the past, like, when Rob Klein was trying to sell us oh my god. I can't think of his management name. Kukua's management. Right? He came to our office in Dallas and sat down, and we talked about it. Like so even though this is a technology product, I do think there is initially going to be some travel out to the clients We we show them a demo, then we go out and we talk to them a little bit and we, you know, we say, we're building this purpose built for you guys, you know, what feature do does that make sense? Like, there Yeah. There's gonna be a white glove kind of process for us at least with the folks that we really know well in the in the industry. I guess Yeah. And and then, Diane, not not to pile on, but I also think that one or two of us should register for Alice. And we should try to campaign to get on their innovation competition. Yeah. But that and that's gonna take some lead time. Right? Because without registering for the conference, you can't really crazy. Be in the game. It's, like, $3,000 per person. It's insane. Yeah. But but if we can get if we can get if we could get into that competition, I think that'll really give us some some real access because that I mean, that's yeah. I don't know. I just think that that that could end end this timing of that could work well. Right? Because that's in January. By then, know, we should really be in a much more advanced stage. Right. And that's six months. That's essentially because we're sitting already July is gonna No. But my point is that we we have to register now. We have to start campaigning now. Right. To be considered for January. Like, if we wait until November, it'll be too late. Right. Right. But do you guys so if we essentially say this is what we need over the next six months, and say it starts August, August, September, October, October, November, December, January, gets us through Alice. Gets us the tech, you know, that we've got here gets us some administrative costs, some travel, some conference time, and I just I continue to work totally for free. I I just like I have I I joke I have a 17 year old son to feed, but I actually do have a 17 year old son to feed. So Oh, tell him he's gotta go to work. Tell him he's because there's hurricanes. Right? Yes. Yes. So and I I feel like we need to start to I I mean, I feel like this. Especially the node. I feel like we need to start to give the node some compensation too because he's really struggling between this part time job and he's doing here. And no offense to to anyone else. Anyone else who needs it please. But, like, I think Vinod and I are probably in the most dire straits. No. Amit, did you start to know anything about programming? Maybe we could really we could accomplish two things. The same time. We could make him part of Howard's team, and then we can we can pay him. That was a joke. Alright. Well Alright. Well, let's let's work on this. Let's let's work on this budget because, again, I I think that that we have good momentum. And if we can get you know, the the development team some more you know, skilled people, we could really enhance our our workflow. It sounds like then we need to I guess, how are you

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:11.626Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:12.775Z)

I mean, maybe in this sheet, right, in this one I put together, the budget, all this stuff here that I put can be deleted. And just use this product development and tools can be that. And otherwise, we just need to fill in. I mean, some of the conferences and stuff down here

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:31.346Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:32.845Z)

because, really, we're talking

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:34.426Z)

And all also, let me point out that development doesn't stop.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:34.805Z)

sounds like less about just what does it take to develop the MVP

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:38.506Z)

Right? So it's not like we say, okay. We've got an MVP. Let's

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:38.865Z)

in three to four months, but also you know, what does it take to develop the MVP, and what is it going to take to get

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:43.176Z)

start getting some feedback, and Vinod and I sit back and twiddle our thumbs until we get the feedback.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:46.125Z)

some people to start using it and get feedback and get buy in?

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:48.146Z)

No. I mean, we know what needs to go into version one.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:49.825Z)

So it's we're talk we're talking more about the

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:52.316Z)

So while the proof or while the MVP is being tested,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:52.445Z)

six Feedback. I think it's, like, to get those letters that Mark's talking about. Right? And then to sit down with the clients and say,

### You (2025-07-10T20:23:56.776Z)

we're still gonna be starting up and and and getting things ready. So there's not gonna be a big gap between

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:23:59.185Z)

let's walk through your pain points. Right? But, like, we now have three clients.

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:03.386Z)

between

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:03.475Z)

That really are on board with us. So we start this in a very white glove approach

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:03.936Z)

the versions. Right? I just wanna make sure everybody's clear. Like, when I when I talked about

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:07.965Z)

with them and say and say,

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:09.276Z)

you know, agile and and going every couple of weeks, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:09.735Z)

right.

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:12.836Z)

while while you're releasing one version, you're still working on the next. Going forward. So that'll help accelerate.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:40.685Z)

Yeah. Mhmm. I agree. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:52.046Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:55.385Z)

And then I

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:57.316Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:24:59.425Z)

because of the work that Drew and Mark and I did about, like, what

### You (2025-07-10T20:24:59.526Z)

So, Diane, if we can, let's get at least two meetings set up for next week. I would say the first one, we can go through this list and

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:03.825Z)

the pain points are and so forth, I'm gonna spend some time next week going back

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:08.116Z)

start scoring.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:08.795Z)

through the first draft of the pitch book I did and trying to

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:09.836Z)

So that we can clearly delineate

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:12.835Z)

make sure I address all of that.

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:13.096Z)

what needs to be in the MVP, what needs to go into version one,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:15.075Z)

Clean it up, try to get it in a a nicer looking format

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:18.526Z)

so that like I said, we so we can just keep going

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:18.965Z)

so that the five of us can start to go through and

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:21.546Z)

I don't ever wanna get to a point where

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:22.375Z)

beat it up. Right? And and and work our way to having a pitch book

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:23.626Z)

Vinod and I are sitting around waiting for decisions to be made or we should be working on next.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:27.725Z)

in the next couple of weeks. Would be nice to have one by the July.

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:29.436Z)

So yeah. Let yeah. Let's do that. So

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:32.495Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:34.386Z)

it works.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:35.325Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:36.456Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:25:44.145Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:25:55.336Z)

I do. I no. I think I think he's at home. So but I but I don't know what his

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:05.025Z)

We were. Right? That because we were in that mode for a while. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-10T20:26:06.136Z)

schedule is. So

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:08.045Z)

So can we just say Monday at three and Thursday at three? Does that work for everyone? Although, we have somebody scheduled for Tuesday already. Business development part. That's between Oh, I'm sorry.

### You (2025-07-10T20:26:18.136Z)

Four. Five,

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:20.445Z)

Yeah. Okay. It's like we're not talking about our hotelie friends. I think I have Monday is not great for me, unfortunately.

### You (2025-07-10T20:26:25.586Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:28.325Z)

Okay. So Tuesday at and Vinod's not on. So Howard, do you know is he working he's not working in Columbus anymore. Right?

### You (2025-07-10T20:26:34.536Z)

Okay. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:38.195Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-10T20:26:42.846Z)

Yep. Alright. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-10T20:26:45.895Z)

Okay. So can we say Thursday at three and then Tuesday at what time? Tuesday, I'm free Five is actually probably good if it's if that works for you guys because it's towards the end of the day for Vinod, and he might not feel as stressed out. Yeah. That works. Okay. Tuesday at five, Thursday at three. I'll get those out there. Okay? Great. Cool. Alright, guys. Happy weekend. Alrighty. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. Bye.
