# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### You (2025-09-15T14:02:24.550Z)

Where in the model. These items are. So if they have to go back and say, oh, okay, Noi is here. In. Here's how we calculated it, so should help them out. Make it speed up a little bit more.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:02:40.628Z)

Got it. And how is the reading of the P and L is going or the pulling up of the P and LS themselves?

### You (2025-09-15T14:02:47.990Z)

Good. The note actually pinged me over the weekend. Let me see here. Just mentioned. Basically just said that he made good progress on extraction, including Aimbridge, which I believe is has a different format. Than some of the other ones.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:03:13.268Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:03:15.110Z)

And that's always an issue when you've got. That's. That's like what we had at Rediq with. Being a rules based that if anything changed. It would throw everything off. It would error out. So it sounds like he's made really big progress on that and should be able to start testing and uploading a bunch of financial statements and confirming that everything was working properly. So start on that.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:03:45.748Z)

Okay? And explain to me again. I keep struggling with this. I feel like it needs to be explained to me, like I'm four years old. Because in my crazy vision that I had, Drew has already mastered the pull up of financials. Like quickly in hotel biz. And now we're going back and doing that again, which is good for us, because the less reliance we have on hotel biz, the better we are feeling more and more and more. Conviction in that every day just because of his relationship with his technology partner, Actable. But why is it that we can't use what Drew, an actable, has already done as far as pulling up financial statements?

### You (2025-09-15T14:04:36.550Z)

So what Drew is doing, and we absolutely can use it. When he gets the financial statements or the financial data into his model. He has each individual line item. Mapped to a central like a master chart of accounts. But he still has to manually copy and paste the data from the client's financial statement into his system.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:05:09.428Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:05:09.750Z)

So that's the part we just automated, right?

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:05:12.628Z)

Okay, got it.

### You (2025-09-15T14:05:15.670Z)

He still has a manual process, but once he's got that copyed in,

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:05:18.628Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:05:21.270Z)

Then it's mapped, and that is essential to us. If we want to do any type of a market analysis, any type of benchmarking.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:05:32.948Z)

Benchmarking.

### You (2025-09-15T14:05:39.350Z)

So that part is. Difficult. What he's done. By client if there's any change. So the actual mapping is something that would be a challenge to automate. Although technology is getting better, I think we could probably at some point do that. But at the same time. It would be just part of our onboarding process. Whenever we get a new client, we'll set them up in the system, we'll give them usernames, et cetera, et cetera. And part of that process will be getting their financial statements, and then Drew can just map them. It should be a one time setup. But. People make changes to their financial statements all the time, Right? So if you get a hotel, say, and they add a food and beverage kiosk,

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:06:39.508Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:06:47.670Z)

After they purchase it, and all of a sudden, boom, you get this food and beverage line item for a kiosk that wasn't there last month. Then you have to make sure you go in there. So I don't know what he's got built in for any type of errors because I always using Power Bi, which is good, I used it for years. But. I always just kind of described it as Excel on steroids. So there's limited functionality. So I don't know if or even how he would have any type of detection in his process that says, oh, here's the line item. That wasn't here last month. Yeah, so, yeah, if you miss that, you could go months, and then all of a sudden, everything's off, so we do need to address that.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:07:33.188Z)

Right. The validation. Right.

### You (2025-09-15T14:07:44.550Z)

But bottom line is, what Drew has put together and what Vinod has put together, they would be consolidated, and then you'd have the full spectrum of the financial analysis.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:07:55.028Z)

Okay, that's great. Sometime this week when I have time. Maybe I already have. So if I have, just tell me. I am going to shoot you. Drew sent me the safe note that he calls it with actable. But the safe note is more of a promissory no. Did I send this to you?

### You (2025-09-15T14:08:15.990Z)

We talked about it, but I don't know that you said anything. I'd have to go through and double check.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:08:17.828Z)

Right, okay. I am going to. Yeah, I'm just find it and resend it to you but probably not until I have time on Wednesday. And just as another smart person to read through it. And just kind of think about in the future, like, call it once we start raising capital. If we wanted to try to buy Actus out of hotel biz or do something so that Drew is freed from Actus. If this makes sense. Right. And he's not dependent on their decision making for everything.

### You (2025-09-15T14:08:54.070Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:08:55.028Z)

Then what might that look like? Because there's a lot of good information in the promissory note as far as what, how they have kind of handcuffed him. Right. With certain terms and things like that, that I just think if he could be free of that, it would probably make him and be able to. Rely on Vinod more than act as then it would help Drew out a lot. At least I think that but.

### You (2025-09-15T14:09:23.030Z)

No, I agree. Yeah, I think it would be very helpful because then Investai would own the ip.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:09:31.508Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-15T14:09:31.670Z)

And that way. For lack of a better term, if Drew gets hit by a bus, we would still be able to continue with the process. So I did see that in the budget. I saw your little footnote, and I think that's a great idea.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:09:46.708Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T14:09:47.590Z)

I'd be glad to take a look at it and see if we can. Ballpark what that might cost us.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:09:53.668Z)

Yeah. At first I thought it would be a very high number, but then I saw Actus. I think the number is they contributed 45k in investment.

### You (2025-09-15T14:10:01.590Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:10:02.548Z)

Which isn't that much, but they're going to be probably sharing revenue with Drew at the same time and then sharing profit.

### You (2025-09-15T14:10:04.470Z)

Great.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:10:10.388Z)

But he's just losing Flint now, so that's his. One of his biggest clients. So it's an interesting time, right, to say okay. And the budget. I saw your note about your personal expenses. That's why I ballparked it at 2k. Because I have about a grand ballpark between the incorporation and the original GoDaddy stuff.

### You (2025-09-15T14:10:30.550Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:10:37.188Z)

So I thought it would be around 2k to reimburse everyone.

### You (2025-09-15T14:10:37.350Z)

Right. Yeah, I think so.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:10:42.708Z)

So I'm going to sit back and can you tell me how that budget might potentially get ripped apart by someone what could look stupid in it? What could look. What might someone challenge in it? Can you give me your thoughts on that?

### You (2025-09-15T14:11:00.230Z)

I didn't see anything in particular. That looked out of line. The only thing is what we mentioned before, that someone might push back against salaries. At what point do you. Start paying a salary. Versus sweat equity at the beginning, but I think you actually had a note in there for it. I don't have it up in front of me right now, but I thought you had something in there about the timing of that.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:11:28.708Z)

Like, initially, the first six months, we're well below 100k. Like you and I would be well below 100k, right?

### You (2025-09-15T14:11:33.110Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:11:35.428Z)

Which. And then Vinod putting him even below what I think is market for him. Which was 125k, grossed up by 20%. But then we would step up into. At some point during the fundraise, we would just. I didn't do a detailed budget. After six months, I was relying more on AI to guide me on. What individual line items might be, but that we would then step up gradually. Then maybe we step up to like 125, and then maybe we step up to 150, and then he steps up too. Right. But everything I read is that the CTO position probably commands the highest actual order draw or salary. And then the others come in, and then I think we could get pushed back on. Like what the amount is. But I have done a lot of research like that. In niche industries that are complex, it's not uncommon for a founder to have a draw or payroll, however you want to call it. Because there's no benefits, right? So it's just an amount. There's no benefits, there's no bonus, there's no load.

### You (2025-09-15T14:12:38.470Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:12:42.788Z)

Of 150 to 180k. And at that point I feel like, okay, at least I could survive on 150 to 180k, right, without benefits, because my husband does have benefits.

### You (2025-09-15T14:12:45.590Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:12:56.068Z)

That would probably help you a lot, too, right? I'm sure what you made at redi q, but it's not. It's not nothing. So, but we'll see how others push back on that.

### You (2025-09-15T14:13:10.230Z)

The only question I have about that, and that's something you'd probably want to talk to your friend about, is the timing, so. Would. An investment part or be comfortable with us going back to, let's just say, February 1st and accruing the back pay, and then. Be paid that amount at some point and then start your salary. Or would they say that once you meet this particular hurdle, Then you can start drawing a salary. So that's the only thing I would question. That's what I'm wondering is, yeah, they may say, we're not going to pay you back salary or reimburse a salary going back to February 1st. You can start drawing a salary when you meet this hurdle.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:13:52.548Z)

Probably the latter. Right.

### You (2025-09-15T14:14:09.590Z)

And that would basically be day one I know nothing about. That's something that we'd have to talk to somebody. And find out how that would be. Is it an issue or not? I don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:14:22.868Z)

Proceed right. Yeah, yeah. Be like, I don't think we ever go back and get reimbursed for our time. Like, I feel like that sunk cost at this point.

### You (2025-09-15T14:14:28.470Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:14:30.628Z)

But could we try to show that you and I and Vanilla, right, are drawing something. But it's really well under what is market for even a fintech startup, right? And then it ramps. Maybe it's not actual revenue goals. Maybe it's like investor dollars. Because this is. I don't. Maybe I don't say this well, but in my mind, this is the vision that I have is that we raise 500k and we spend. We have six months. Right. But I'M. Really thinking about it in terms of a year. Like, what could we in a year reasonably accomplish? And to me, what is the most important is for us to be quick. But careful. Right. And get a Persona of each type of user. And get them on in a beta position and just very carefully and quickly work through what is it that they want. Could be. It could be different than what we think it is, right? Like, how do we get it down, how do we do the reps to make sure we're getting it right and so that the at the end, we have a very happy beta customer in each one of those Personas. Right. And maybe we're not actually creating a lot of revenue for ourselves, but then your two kicks in, and we have the referrals that are necessary. Right. And maybe it's before year two. But I'm just trying to, like. It's like, first focus on the Personas, one of each, and just really go in and be careful and do the diligence work that we need to get. Get it set up for them. That's when we have a happy referral. Then we can start to go out and get more clients like that Persona. And start to grow our revenue. And I think we'll grow quickly once we have a happy Beta customer that can speak positively for us. But so I'll pause.

### You (2025-09-15T14:16:18.710Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:16:30.148Z)

I mean, how does that sound to you? What could. What could be right or what could be wrong about that approach?

### You (2025-09-15T14:16:35.750Z)

No, that was my assumption, and that's how. That roadmap that I put with the four boxes. Each of those four boxes includes the Persona. That would be utilized at that time. So I think we have to do that. It could not be to anybody's advantage to have a broker or an investor start playing with the model. With the mvp. I think on their very first deal, when they get down to the other revenue and the other expense sections with food and beverage and everything, if we can't get down to the level of detail that they want, they would probably just stop and say, call me later when this is ready. So why. Why bother? Let's just go ahead and identify some of those lenders. Maybe an appraiser that starts there. And then of course, like I've always said, that while they're testing Vinod and the team would be working on getting that level of detail. Like I've always said, you don't just fit everything into a nice, neat box. And so during this time, we only talk about lenders. It's like, no, it's a constant. You know, revolving things.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:18:02.708Z)

Continuous improvement right now, okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:18:05.910Z)

That's the way I've been assuming. We would be doing it.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:18:08.228Z)

Okay? And then let me see. There was something else I wanted to ask your opinion about. Me one second. I'm just pulling it up. Back to teams. Share my screen. And I'm gonna jump. Can you see this? Our business vision.

### You (2025-09-15T14:18:45.670Z)

Let me see. Here.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:18:46.468Z)

No. I might have done the share screen too quickly.

### You (2025-09-15T14:18:50.950Z)

Yeah, I know. I can see it now.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:18:52.788Z)

Okay? So this is a very, very ugly and messy slide.

### You (2025-09-15T14:18:53.750Z)

Yeah. Yeah, that's the one I was going to try to work on over the weekend, and I didn't have a chance to get to it yet.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:18:57.828Z)

But I was trying.

### You (2025-09-15T14:19:03.030Z)

But yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:19:03.748Z)

But what I'm trying to do is show someone that our vision is to be like, we're starting with a pipeline management and avm. But for all of those naysayers out there that say, oh, I'll never use an ABM because I can't let go of my Excel model, It is, then. Okay, well, these are the other workflows we're gonna start to tackle. And when we tackle them, it's to your point, it's continuous improvement process, right? And the order in which I have these could be completely different than what the clients want. Some of them, we may get to a client and say, oh, this isn't even needed. Right. But the idea is you just. This is step one. We're here right now. And then we just start to work through all of these other. Like maybe the DSF and appraisal deployment. Maybe this shouldn't even be on here, right? And we just take it off because it doesn't fit this idea. But I do believe the full service module release is important, right? Because this is where those Excel users, those hyper Excel users, will get something that resembles the detailed Excel model that they use for analysis. The underwriting to actual roadmap, I think, is really important. This is where, you know, it's always active, that underwriting is always alive in the system and you're always able to track back to it. I had a good call this week with an attorney, Megan Kochi, at Latham Watkins. Linc Watkins. And they deployed Harvey. They signed an enterprise agreement. With Harvey about three or four weeks ago. So she was telling me, like, how they're rolling out Harvey and the training and the senior people and the junior people. But she said Harvey is becoming the de facto legal workflow tool. Right. Not ironclad, which also is contracts driven. But Harvey is built by an actual law firm. Like, you know, people with a. Legal background, and so it is becoming the de facto law firm. Workflow automation tool. She said she was gonna look into, like, how eventually they plan to integrate with things like Deal Path and Deal Cloud. But I did some research over the weekend. And I think it's inevitable that Harvey will integrate with those type of workflow tools. And we're one of them, right? It's just a matter of time.

### You (2025-09-15T14:21:42.470Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:21:46.708Z)

So that's good. So that kind of leads me into the concept of we should have, at some point in the future, right. A working group of hotel attorneys that can help us. We're gonna need, probably, at some point, reach out to Harvey and try to stay on their list so that when they do have an. Integration with DealPath and the deal clouds of the world that were up there, and we're creating an integration that's similar. The hotel Pip is the renovation. Right. The loan servicing module. I wanna stop here for a minute because. I love the idea of variable usage. You call it usage pricing, right? Because I think that allows us to price more on, like, an AUM or along those type of terms. And then when clients aren't using it, they don't feel like they're burdened with the expense. But where that leaves us is we can't be 100% variable in our revenue structure. Right. We need to have some recurring revenue that. I'll call it it. Keep the lights on revenue. Its revenue that just exists out there. It can be a de minimis amount of revenue, but it allows us to not have to lay off people or like, you know, not utilize people if we run into another macroeconomic crisis that, you know, really hurts progress or something like that. And I could see the loan servicing as being one of these just to keep the revenue right. Loans need to be serviced no matter what. If deals are getting done. If deals aren't getting done, every deal almost has a loan. So I would look at this as. And a lot of our competitors are going after this business. So it will be a competitive win for us. And maybe we may have to price it lower than we want to, but if it's tied to deals like the deal flow workflows, then I think we have a better shot. We probably need one or two other keep the lights on type of revenue strategies here so that we have enough to cover X amount in cost. Right. Maybe it's like we all have to fall back into virtually no pay at the founders and we. But we can keep the carries and the software engineers and stuff like that. Going.

### You (2025-09-15T14:24:14.710Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:24:16.388Z)

The investment management module. This would be starting to interact more with MRI Real page. I don't want to say interact with Yardy because I know that it's very difficult, but workarounds with Yard, it's like the parabute. We become like the hotel. Hotel module. That is paraview, right? And it creates. Right. And then that can interface with Juniper square. And then the hotel transaction closing module. Is when you're actually closing a deal, right? And now you've signed your purchase agreement, you signed your management agreement, and your 30 days or 15 days from closing. This is an actual module that kicks in and helps to manage the workflows. Right? So we would be working very closely with management companies because they're the ones that have these workflows around transition. If this makes sense, right? Who's going to do what? And so in my mind, We are working incredibly collaboratively with management companies so that other constituents, like owners and investors, have full transparency into where we are with the takeover or transition process. And from a financial perspective. Our system is using AI to automate the financial proration part of a hotel transaction, which is very simplistic. It's not that hard. It's like the day of closing. As of midnight X amount of revenues go to buyer, xcode seller. Right? And then you go down and you look at your cost. And you used to have to count cash, but now that's a hard ly anything. You have to count inventories. Which had a big, full service hotel. The liquor and the meat add up pretty quickly to a big item, but it's nothing at a select service hotel. But then inevitably. And your real estate tax prorations, which can take quite a long time to do manually. But we would be working with the Ryans or the cbres of the world. To, like, pull that in. And then there's typically a true up that has to be done. I'll call it 30 or 60 days after the deal is transacted. We would handle that. But that allows us to be in contact with the title companies. Right. And be working on that closing statement, which gives us access to the actual purchase price. Right? So that's why I think that's important. I do think ESG is going to become more important. A lot of people blow it off right now, but this would be integrations with measurable squeak right? Things that people aren't thinking about. It might be integrations with the meeting planner community, because I think a lot of owners would be incredibly surprised to see what meeting planners think of their hotels and the markets that they're in from a sustainability perspective. And owners are living out in La La land right now. But the other area that may start to form around this is lending, right? There may be ESG particular lending platforms that emerge that you would want to take advantage of. So, like, in the future, I see us having something like this. The fund at administration. Collab. This would be a collab with Juniper Square or Appfolio or whoever the client is using. And this is transparency for the client, for their investors, but also fundraising. It's changing, right? So more and more investors are turning to retail channels which require the utmost transparency and can require almost daily valuations, which gets back to our core module. If this makes sense of like having an actual right and how we can help them. Education and training. This one is actually kind of really near and dear to my heart because I think once the data becomes more available and you don't have to spend so much time manipulating the data.

### You (2025-09-15T14:27:54.950Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:28:30.068Z)

It opens a door for people to be able to learn more about how to actually drive revenue and how to manage cost. And you would be shocked at. Well, maybe you wouldn't be shocked, but how little brokers actually know about any of this, right? Or how little some young acquisition analysts? Or like how Carrie said, like the young dead and structured finance people really, truly understand. And it's important because you have to drive the revenue. And the revenue is much more complex than just a revpar index. And so I see us collabs with universities that are spitting out young students. Collabs on training for our own tools. Colabs for maybe training on AI. Right. So, but like. And a lot of it being video based and being very modern and its look and feel. But again, that's in the future way. Like I'm just. I'm just like a five to seven year vision.

### You (2025-09-15T14:29:29.750Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:29:32.548Z)

The unique identifier collab. And then this last thing is something I do think we might need to pull up in our workflows, but it's too early to talk about it. Which is unstructured data and video and voice and how to make the most of that. So then I'm just gonna get to the last thing, which is this. These guys over here. This is what you've. You know, you've always said that it's not the workflows, the value, the money. Profit is not in the workflows. It's in the data. Right. So I. Would almost put, like, $3 here and say, like, three dot. Like, this is on the right side of the screen. How we're really gonna monetize this platform?

### You (2025-09-15T14:30:01.750Z)

Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:30:11.908Z)

Which is the data, the transaction marketplace. And I thought of one more, and this is from your You've suggested this, but in the international expansion strategy, like these are the three things that will really take us. To 100mil an ARR. The workflows are all great. Again, they might not all exist. Like that, we're thinking, right? So it's almost like it's like a roadmap, right? Like, it's like this is where we are. And we move through all of these things over the next five to seven years. Some things we'll do, some things we. Won't do. And then we're gonna start to create the value over here for the company. But in here somewhere, we do need these. Keep the lights on, revenue, so that we can show it would be easy enough for us to maintain if our annual costs are. I'm just gonna make this up in the future. Like $7 million a year. I'm just making. Totally making this up. Right? That we would have enough to cover ourselves. We would have recurring revenue enough to cover that 7 million, so we would never have to seek. Is this making sense? Or call capital or call funds to cover a loss.

### You (2025-09-15T14:31:14.070Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:31:32.148Z)

So I wanted to explain it because I'm not sure the slide actually does a good job of explaining how I was thinking of it. But this dac, the way I've written it, might not describe in the words, and the sections might not actually describe the vision well enough. But I do believe in one slide we could put the vision and make it nice and clear and wrapped up to investors. So I'm sorry, I rambled for about 10 minutes on that, but I just wanted you to understand where my, like, why I was doing what I was doing.

### You (2025-09-15T14:31:58.630Z)

Yeah. No. No. That makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:32:09.108Z)

Ok. Now, I am terrible at PowerPoint, right? So if you have time this week to think about what's a better infographic or better way to lay this out, I would love that because that's not in my skill set.

### You (2025-09-15T14:32:25.110Z)

No, I can help with that. I'm just. Is there any rhyme or reason to the ordering of these items? You know, from left to right or up to down? Is it just kind of a brain dump?

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:32:41.508Z)

Is it, brain dump.

### You (2025-09-15T14:32:41.990Z)

Okay, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:32:42.308Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think the legal and the pip workflows are important. Like you were talking about the continuous improvement. Because the sooner we get these two things just started right, we don't even have to have them finished.

### You (2025-09-15T14:32:51.110Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:32:57.508Z)

Then we shut down the naysayers that say, I don't need an avm. Right. Because this doesn't make sense. You're saying, oh, no, we're more than an abm. And you would really take. You would really have great advantage from, like, how we're working through the renovation piece. Of this and digitizing the renovation piece of it. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-09-15T14:33:01.590Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:33:18.148Z)

So those two in particular. And then I do think, like, the interactive OM piece. That what we saw so that investors don't have to recreate OMs when they're going out to fundraise.

### You (2025-09-15T14:33:34.150Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:33:35.108Z)

That is kind of important, but then outside of that, This is just a complete brain dump.

### You (2025-09-15T14:33:40.630Z)

Okay? I'm going to send you something, you know. Little while there is. Something that I saw. On the substack article or just a post? And it's like I knew this, but I haven't tried it yet. Google Gemini is free to use and it does a very good job with infographics. So I will send you the step by step, and I'm going to try it myself. But, you know, something like this might be, you know, something to test it with at least. You could probably just upload this as a, you know, just take a screenshot of it.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:34:28.948Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-15T14:34:34.870Z)

And put in whatever prompt, but, yeah. I can clean this up easily. I can just get the boxes to align vertically, horizontally. You know, make it a little easier to read. But we can also try Gemini to create a separate infographic. To see if that would help.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:34:56.228Z)

Great. That's great. And maybe one more. Just thought on this is because I'm seeing where Mark's head is going, we might want to add a box that shows, like, the Persona Beta or something like that.

### You (2025-09-15T14:34:56.390Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:35:06.788Z)

Because on our last call, I saw Mark kind of question if we should even have an appraiser module. And that's we have to have an appraiser module. We'll be leaving money on the table if we didn't have something like that. And maybe to him it's not that important. Because he's a deal guy, right? And so he kind of.

### You (2025-09-15T14:35:07.110Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:35:30.868Z)

He puts down the appraisal work, right, as being non value and things like that, but there's a lot of money to be made on appraisals.

### You (2025-09-15T14:35:37.270Z)

There is. Yeah. No, I. I agree. Then my. My question is, what? I think I would like to go through each Persona. And find out, you know, exactly what would this Persona need and not need. Right? So would. Would a lender and an appraiser need the exact same model? Or is there something one needs at the other that you know? Cause that's what I want to do is I would love to have specific AVM models based on the Persona. So if I'm a lender, Account. When I log in, I get the lender model, same thing, appraiser. And so that's what I need to do is like, do we need. Right now I'm kind of breaking it down into three, right? So I've got the debt, equity and asset management. But within the debt. Is there a difference between lenders and appraisers and loan servicers? And if so,

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:36:41.588Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-15T14:36:46.550Z)

Then it's gonna add additional levels, but, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:36:49.988Z)

Okay? So write this down, or if the video is recording this, and let me think if I can go back and get this right. I think of it more like six, or maybe there's seven. So I'll always start with the owner, because I just feel like the equity owner is like, you know, I'm coming from that Persona, and I'm trying to solve my own problems. But then there is the lender and the appraiser. That's three.

### You (2025-09-15T14:37:01.190Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:37:18.708Z)

The hotel operating community. Right. So these are third party managers that could have funds, could not have funds, but their feasibility work is more detailed than, say, a lender or an appraiser's work, right? You have, I think. You have, Brand, and that's one that we haven't really talked about yet. But when we start to get into PIP collaboration, right, and we start to get into legal workflows, And they also have to track revenue. And they have to. The clients, the operators feed them their revenue. They don't feed them any expenses. But the brands also submit new supply to Smith Travel. And then the last thing is the brands could write very big checks for us. Right? It's like 500k is nothing for Marriott or Hilton or Hyatt to write from an investor perspective from us.

### You (2025-09-15T14:38:16.630Z)

Here.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:38:24.548Z)

They are Also investors in 5th wall, both Marriott and Hilton. So it's almost like a strategic path. Like if we could get them, not immediately, because they're going to be probably one of the later Personas that we start to work on, but if we could get a Persona established for them and a good working relationship. Maybe we get them in our pre seed funding so it helps us when we go to Series A because they're already part of fifth wall. If this is making sense. But. So that's five. And what am I missing? I said owner, lender, appraiser, Right? I said hotel operator. I said brand.

### You (2025-09-15T14:38:54.310Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:39:05.748Z)

And maybe it's the servicer that I forgot which would be the six, but.

### You (2025-09-15T14:39:12.790Z)

Well, those aren't the Personas. But let's think of. So. So the Personas. We got investor, broker, appraiser.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:39:16.148Z)

Okay? Rover. That's why I'm missing broker.

### You (2025-09-15T14:39:22.790Z)

Lender, servicer. And asset manager. Those are the six or seven. So let's think about it this way. Let's stick with the three groups. Debt, equity and asset management. And then within those groups. So what I have proposed in terms of the pricing is everyone has to subscribe to the core AVM model. Right, so we'll have a core model for debt. A core model for equity. Core model for asset management.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:40:04.548Z)

And then let's just add right here while we're at this. A poor model for anyone that's doing heavy operational underwriting.

### You (2025-09-15T14:40:05.750Z)

Then. That would be under the. Yeah, that. That'll be under the asset management. To me, asset management is operations.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:40:12.788Z)

Like an operator, okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:40:19.910Z)

So whether it's an asset manager, because here's where I'm going. Is, then we can start upselling modules. So. For those specialty items, like, for example, the operator you mentioned some of those that you need to have that almost a daily feed. Of this data. So the asset management core product could have an operator module. So they subscribe to the core, then they'll have to subscribe to the module. That module then would essentially be the API. That could connect between the two, right? So let's look at it that way. We don't want to call them Personas. They're not Personas, but they are different levels. Of. Of those Personas or adjacent type things. Right, So.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:41:24.308Z)

Right. And the only thing, Howard, I'll say is in the lingo. I see you're putting that under asset management, but in the hotel space. Asset management is really thought of as, like, an owner function. And it tends to be operational basis, but it's different than the hotel manager or brand. And so that is why I think. Yeah, yeah. So there's. I do think there's four in the hotel industry and how, like, it's thought out. I understand, like, why you put it under asset management, because there. Are a lot of. And I can see that in the multifamily space.

### You (2025-09-15T14:41:46.230Z)

Yeah. We could change the label. Yeah. Well, let's. Let's. Instead of calling it asset management, let's just say, like, operations and asset management or whatever, because the core model would still be the same.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:42:05.028Z)

But it's.

### You (2025-09-15T14:42:15.510Z)

So we wouldn't have a core model for asset management and a core model for operations, because that would basically be the same. But then we would have, like. Well, we would have subgroups. Right. We're far out on the future, so. So right now our focus. Yeah, yeah. So right now our focus is on the debt.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:42:26.468Z)

Pretty different, though. Yeah. Right. But we can play, yeah? Yes, absolutely. Right. But we're on the right track, right?

### You (2025-09-15T14:42:39.030Z)

Then we will work on the equity, then we can work on that. So we're at least six to nine months away from doing that. So, yeah, let's think about it. But let's. Let's kind of think about it.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:42:45.988Z)

I know, I know.

### You (2025-09-15T14:42:50.550Z)

And in terms of funnel. Yeah, if you can just think of the core, avm, and then what we need in addition to that core, to help specific user groups, right? And that way we would still get the core subscription, which I think would be what you mentioned. You know, this is our base, our study. You know, this is your cost per month. You get access to this core model. You know, we can talk about, you know, like, with the AI features or anything else that, you know, that we would charge for usage. So, you know, we can ride these peaks and valleys with, with that, you know, we can, we can talk about how we would structure that. But at least if we have it broken down with the core model, that gives us the steady revenue that we're looking for. And the core model would also be where we go with the T shirt sizing. Right. So if I'm a small investor, that I might do two or three deals a year. Versus the institutional that's doing, you know, two or three a month. Then you know, we can charge accordingly. So I think, you know, and then I'm looking at your list here, you know, there within that, you know, the legal. Would be an add on. Not everybody's going to want that. Right. So all of these, in fact, many of these then would be add ons. So we're going to have a menu.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:44:22.788Z)

Right? Right. Add ons. Yes.

### You (2025-09-15T14:44:29.110Z)

Yeah. So we're good. We're going to have a menu there where they can say, okay, I am a debt client.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:44:30.148Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-15T14:44:36.070Z)

And along with that, ID this, this and this. Or I'm in equity and I need this and this, but I don't do this right, or, you know, let's go from there. So, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:44:46.548Z)

Right? Right. Right. Right. Exactly. So thank you for letting me just explain the vision. And I think that when we work on this as a team and come up with a really good slide like this, it'll help our investors understand how. Without having to even talk about tam. Because the right hand side of this is the tam, right? I mean, it's. The. Or it's our ARR. I don't know. Maybe what you would describe, right? Like, how can we even think. Little old InnVestAI could get to 100 million in ARR and it's because of what's on the right of this. So I think it'll help our investors, but I also think it could help Mark because he's struggling to understand this, right?

### You (2025-09-15T14:45:28.150Z)

Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:45:33.268Z)

And he's going to be the one selling it and talking to people.

### You (2025-09-15T14:45:35.990Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:45:37.428Z)

So how we figure out a way to communicate this to him is going to be important.

### You (2025-09-15T14:45:43.910Z)

Yeah, yeah, let's. Let's try to put together a slide that kind of shows, you know, like, those three cores, you know, maybe four later on. And let's just kind of, you know, I'm a visual person. You can explain it to me all day long, but when I see a diagram that shows. Okay, here's your core in the center. Then kind of like that hand drawn thing that you sent, right? So you've got your debt model, and then here's all the additional debt items we could sell. Then another slide for equity, same thing like that. I know that would help me. I don't know if Mark is the same way or not.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:46:17.268Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I'm. I'm 100%. Not married to how this is, like, you know, visualized, but. But we're on the same wavelength when it comes to, like, how it materializes over 5 to 7. I mean, this is. This is gonna take us a very, very long time to. To do this.

### You (2025-09-15T14:46:19.590Z)

But. Yeah. Right. Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. Three to five, at least. Roadmap some of them, maybe even beyond right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:46:44.068Z)

Right, okay. Okay. So is there anything else that we.

### You (2025-09-15T14:46:53.030Z)

I was going to mention earlier in the conversation you started listing real page, MRI, Yardi, etc. Realpage doesn't have anything in hospitality. They do have like Airbnb verbo type of product for single family rentals. But I think we need to specify within each. So number one, I would just take real page out of a vocabulary.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:47:23.988Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-15T14:47:24.950Z)

Until they buy somebody. In the hospitality space. But when we say, like, yardy, let's specify, you know, like, which yardy module is hospitality mri.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:47:28.148Z)

Okay? Got it.

### You (2025-09-15T14:47:37.270Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:47:38.148Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-15T14:47:38.950Z)

You know, because there's going to be a lot of people who are not familiar with those tools, and they may not even know who Yardi is. Right. So.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:47:49.428Z)

And there are a lot of people who will have a visceral negative reaction and be like,

### You (2025-09-15T14:47:52.470Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, that'll also show that we've done our research, that we know that you already has this particular product, and, I mean, we could even do, you know, a little bit more deep research.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:47:56.148Z)

Art, right? It's Voyager. I think. Yeah, but. Yes, we should do the Deepa research.

### You (2025-09-15T14:48:07.590Z)

Well, Voyager. Yeah, Voyager is their overall. Property management, but then within Voyager, see, same thing. Modules, right? You've got your core, then you've got your different modules for commercial, multifamily, self storage things. These different asset types. So that's. That's where I'm saying I think we need to drill down to find exactly where is. The hospitality.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:48:16.708Z)

Y.

### You (2025-09-15T14:48:34.070Z)

Within yardi? Yeah. I mean, do they have to subscribe to three different expensive products to get what they need? You know, we can. You know, if we can do. I can take that on because I'm familiar with it. I can start doing some.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:48:36.308Z)

Ard I? Yes.

### You (2025-09-15T14:48:52.950Z)

More detailed competitive research just to figure out exactly what these companies have to offer.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:49:02.068Z)

Okay, sounds good.

### You (2025-09-15T14:49:03.750Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:49:04.228Z)

And then I'll just close it. That a priority for me is I need to get a safe form, safe note, agreement to Carlos. I said I would have it today, but I think it's realistic because it's the first safe note we've done as a team that if it takes a couple more days. He's not going to be angry about that because I had proposed a start date of October 1st, but I just am worried we're gonna bottleneck on this. So Drew. I'm trying to set it up so that Drew is the one that actually produces, researches and produces the safe note. Right. So that. It doesn't look like I'm trying to control the whole process, because I'm not trying to control the whole process.

### You (2025-09-15T14:49:14.790Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Right? Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:49:48.068Z)

I just wanted to be a market. There has to be a market. Safe? No. Out there.

### You (2025-09-15T14:49:52.950Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:49:53.108Z)

But if this ends up kicking over till tomorrow on our 5:30 call, just to reinforce that, we just need a simple market safe note and we need to get it out quickly. Right. And so, okay.

### You (2025-09-15T14:50:05.750Z)

Yeah. Yep. Okay? Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:50:10.068Z)

All right then we will Talk tomorrow at 5:30.

### You (2025-09-15T14:50:13.430Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:50:14.708Z)

All right. Thank you.

### You (2025-09-15T14:50:14.950Z)

We'll see you later. Okay, bye.

### Guest (2025-09-15T14:50:16.228Z)

Bye.
