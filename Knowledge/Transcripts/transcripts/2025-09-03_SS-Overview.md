Hello, Granola.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:01:21.304Z)

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us. My name is Alex Goodwin. I'm with blue way financial partners of raymond james. Today we're going to be talking about Social Security. This is part three of our quarterly webinar series that we do. Throughout the year. We'll have one more later this year, details to be determined and will be sent to you when that happens, okay? So again today we have Hillary Hatch from the Social Security Administration here in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Social Security is a big, broad topic. Something that we don't know everything about. So we like to bring in the experts, like Hillary here to discuss these things. Social Security from our conversations with folks. Comes up all the time, weekly, daily. People want to know, is Social Security going to be around? What are the ins and outs? Very specific questions you may have to your own situation or just broad general questions. That's what Hillary's here to talk to you about. Okay. But before Hillary begins, I just want to let you know that this is one being recorded. So if you have to drop off or if you'd like to send this to somebody again, a recording will be made available and will be distributed. And other than that. We can save the rest for the end. And I'll let Hillary dive into it here. Thanks, hillary. Awesome. Thank you so much. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to get started here. I'm going to share my screen so you can see my presentation. There's a ton of information to cover in a short amount of time. But we will certainly get through it all. And then at the end, open it up for any questions that you may have. So we will be talking about all things Social Security today. We'll also touch on Medicare a little bit as well. First I need to read our disclaimer slide. Just letting you know this information is current at the time of the presentation, but Social Security policy is subject to change for the most updated information. You can get that on our website SSA.gov. So the number one question that we typically get asked at Social Security is individuals wanting to know when is the best time to file for benefits or what is the age to start collecting. And there really isn't a one best age for everyone, but there's probably a right age or right time for you to start collecting Social Security benefits. But really, you need to understand all of the numbers when you are thinking about when the best age or the right time for you to file may be. And those are the things that we're going to talk about today. So some of the numbers that we will have a better understanding of when the presentation is over is knowing how early you can start collecting a Social Security benefit. Knowing your full retirement age and how that impacts what your benefit is going to be. How much benefit will be at age 62 versus weighting until age 70 and the amounts in between. Can your spouse receive or will your spouse be eligible for benefits off of your record? Maybe you'll be eligible for benefits off of your spouse's record, or maybe there is a divorce spouse that is involved. How much can you earn while you're collecting benefits? If you want to continue to work while you're collecting, you can do so, but there are some earnings limitations. And then I also mentioned Medicare. We'll touch a little bit on Medicare as well. So how you qualify for a retirement benefit off of your own work record is by earning credit when you work in pay Social Security taxes. So you need 40 credits or 10 years of work, and you must be 62 or older. To earn a credit. It is based on a gross dollar amount typically increases each year. So for this year, to earn one credit, you need $1,810 in gross earnings, and the maximum amount of credits you can earn per year is four. So to earn all four credits this year, you would need to earn at least $7,240 in gross wages. And it doesn't matter if you make all of that in one month if it takes you over the course of the entire year. Once you have reached that number, you have earned your four credits. Something that's important to know about credits is that once you earn them, you never lose them. So, for example, you may be someone that has been working. You start out working at a younger age. Maybe you have to leave the workforce for an extended period of time to take care of children, to take care of Berends whatever. The case may be when you reenter the workforce later on, any credits that you have are still there. So really, the takeaway here is in order to qualify for a retirement benefit based off of your own work record, you need 40 credits. Which again, that's 10 years of work. It doesn't have to be consecutive. And you must be 62 or older. How Social Security determines your benefit amount is based on your earnings over your entire lifetime. And there's a three step process that we use in our computation. So first, your wages are adjusted for changes in wage levels over time. So basically, we're giving a higher value to your actual earnings to account for inflation. We then find the monthly average of your 35 highest earnings years. And the result is the average index monthly earnings. So when we are looking at your earnings record, We are taking your 35 highest earnings years and that's what we are using in our computation. If you do not have 35 years of work, that's okay. Let's say you only have 25 years of work. That means we would use all 25 years, plus we would use 10 zeros, because we always use 35 years in that computation. And I'll give you a couple of examples. Of why that matters. But first, I want to talk about indexing. So when we talk about taking your actual earnings and giving them a higher value, we call this indexing. And if you look at column C, the index factor, This might not be the same for you because your index factor that is used in the calculation, it's based on your year of birth. So in this example, this individual in 1991 has actual earnings of $10,000. So we take the actual earnings, we multiply it by the index factor for that year. So that 2.55 number, and the result is the indexed earnings of 25,504. So when we are determining your 35 highest earnings years, we are looking at the amounts in column D, we're looking at the indexed earnings, and that's what we're using in the computation. If you go back to column C and look at that index. You can see that number is reducing over time. So once you reach age 60 and beyond, the index factor is 1. The reason that we talk about this is because sometimes individuals will be ready to retire and they will say something like, you know, I'm just going to give it one more year, because if I work another year, it's going to increase my Social Security benefit. But if that one more year of work is not one of those highest 35 years we use in the computation, it's not going to increase the Social Security benefit. So again, we're using 35 years in that computation. Now, if you're someone, maybe you've only worked 25 years so that means we're using 25 years plus 10 zeros. If you are someone that decides, you know, I'm going to give it one more year because that's going to increase my Social Security benefit. Well, that one more year of work would replace one of those zero years. And in that situation, it would increase the Social Security benefits. I'm going to be talking about what we call a my Social Security account. It's an online account that you can create, and by having the my Social Security account, that's where you can get a lot of this information and you can run different scenarios. If you were going to go from part or if you're going to go from full time to part time work, how would that impact your benefit? Maybe you're someone that's going to stop working at age 60, but not start collecting until 67. How will that impact your benefit? So I'm going to show you where to go to get all that information a little bit later on in the presentation. So knowing your full retirement age is extremely important because at full retirement age is when you receive 100% of your Social Security benefits. So for individuals born 1960 or later, full retirement age is age 67. Now, the earliest that any of us can start collecting a Social Security benefit is at age 62 and someone born 1960 or later. If they start collecting at age 62, they're only receiving 70% of their benefit. Once you reach age 70, you can collect the Social Security benefit after you have earned all of what we call the delayed retirement credits. And this is when your benefit would be at a highest. So for someone born 1960 or later, if they waited until age 70 to collect the percentage, there is 124%. So from the time you reach full retirement age up until age 70 is when you're earning those delayed retirement credits. Once you reach age 70, the benefit doesn't increase anymore based on your age, so there'd be no point in delaying in filing for those Social Security benefits. This is an example of what I just talked about, but it's showing dollar amount s. So in this example, this individual born 1960 or later, they have a full retirement age of age 67. You can see their benefit amount. There is $1,000. Now, if they file early, meaning prior to their full retirement age, let's say they File at age 62, they're only receiving $700 per month. And if they wait until age 70, after they have earned all of those delayed retirement credits, their benefit is the 1240 per month. So this chart only shows yearly amounts, but it is a monthly increase. So every month that you wait to file, the higher your benefit will be. And once you file and start collecting, you are locked into that amount. So, for example, if this person files at age 62 and they're only getting 700 per month, Once they reach full retirement age, their benefit doesn't increase to that $1,000. They're still only getting the $700 per month. Now, typically, we have cost of living adjustments that will take place each year, so that's one way that the benefit could increase. But it's important to know once you file and start collecting, you are locked into that amount. So next I'm going to transition into benefits for spouses in divorce. Spouses. And then we will talk about benefits for children and then we will go into survivor benefits. So when we talk about benefits for spouses in divorced spouses, and even with the survivor benefits, it's a lot of information that is on the slides. So I'm going to go through each of the bullet points, but then I'll give an example, so hopefully you'll be able to understand a little bit better. With benefits for a spouse. The maximum benefit amount that a spouse can receive is 50% of the workers unreduced benefit. There is a reduction for early retirement. If the spouse's own benefit is less than 50% of the workers, they will be combined to equal 50% of the workers. It does not reduce the payment to the worker. The benefit is unreduced if the spouse is caring for a workers child younger than 16 or disabled. And spousal benefits are not payable until the worker collects. So let's say my husband, at his full retirement age, his benefit amount is $2000. That means the maximum that I can receive is $1000. Now, I'm only going to get that $1,000 if I start collecting at my full retirement age. If I start collecting early, the benefit amount is going to be different, and the percentage I receive will just depend on how old I am at the time I start collecting. But let's say I'm also doing a benefit off of my own work record. If the benefit and my own record is higher than 50% of my husband. I'm not going to qualify for a spousal benefit. So in this example, if my own benefit, let's say, is $1,200 per month, I'm not going to qualify for a spousal benefit because my own benefit's higher. But let's say my benefit is only $700 per month. That means I can receive $700 off of my own record. Plus an additional $300 from my spouse's record. And the combination of the two equal 50% of his. Again, I'm speaking as if I'm filing at my full retirement age. If I start collecting early, those amounts are going to be different in the percentages will just depend on how old I am at the time I start collecting. The one exception to this rule is if we have a child that is younger than 16 or a disabled child that I'm caring for, then the spousal benefit that I would receive would not be reduced if I started collecting early. Anything I receive off of my husband's record, it's not going to reduce his own benefit at all. But I cannot start collecting that spousal benefit until he files and starts collecting his own benefit. So if I'm doing benefit off of my own record and I'm going to be doing a spousal benefit, I may be ready to file and start collecting before my husband, so I can certainly do that. I can file and start collecting benefits off of my own record. And then later on, whenever he's ready to file and start collecting, is when I could get that additional spousal amount. Benefits for divorced spouses are similar. You can receive benefits on your former spouse's record. Even if he or she has remarried. If the marriage lasted at least 10 years. You are unmarried. You are age 62 or older. Your ex spouse is at least 62, ineligible for Social Security benefits. Even if they're not collecting. So that's a huge difference there. And then the benefit you would receive based on your own work is less than the benefit you would receive based on your ex spouse's work. So if my ex husband at his full retirement age, his benefit is $2,000. The most that I could receive is half of that. So the most I can get is $1,000. But if the benefits on my own record are higher than that, I cannot collect an ex spousal benefit. If the benefits that my own record are less, that means I can receive a combination of the two to equal 50% of his. Now, when I'm ready to file and start collecting, if I'm going to be due a benefit off of my ex spouse's record, as long as he is at least 62 ineligible, I can start collecting. Doesn't matter if he's collecting or not. If we were still married, he would have to be collecting in order for me to get that ex spousal benefit. Or for me to get the spousal benefit, but because we're divorced, I can collect, even though he's not. Anything that I receive off of his record, it's not going to reduce his benefit at all. If he's remarried in his spouse is collecting a benefit off of his record, anything that I receive as the ex spouse would not impact that benefit either. I usually will get questions on. Well, where do I get this information or how do I know if I'm going to be eligible? So when you want to get information about your own retirement benefits, you can do that through your my Social Security account, that online account. But you don't have access to divorced spousal information, so you would want to call your local office directly to get information to see if you would be eligible for a benefit. And how much that benefit will be. So again, the amount that a spouse or an ex spouse can receive is 50% of the workers benefit at their full retirement age. So if my husband or my ex husband. His full retirement age is age 67, and his benefit is $1,000. That means the 50% amount I can receive would be 500. So half of that 1,000 at his full retirement age, if he starts collecting early and he's only getting $100 per month. That 50% amount that I can receive is still 50% of that 1,000, not his age 62amount. But same is true if we go in the other direction. So if my spouse or my ex spouse waits to file until age 70 after he has earned all of those delayed retirement credits. That 50% amount that I can receive is 50% of that 1,000, not 50% of his age 70amount. Social Security also pays benefits to children. If a parent is receiving a retirement benefit, a disability benefit, or a parent has passed away, there could be potential survivors that are payable to any children as long as the child is unmarried. Younger than age 18 or up to age 19 if they are still in high school full time. Or if they are 18 or older and disabled. From a disability that started before the age of 22. So when you file for a retirement benefits, we will ask, do you have any minor children? Do you have any children that became disabled before the age of 22? If those questions are answered yes, that will indicate to Social Security. Okay. We need to get additional information to see if a child or children are going to qualify for benefits off of mom or dad's record. And so we'll take the applications in order to get those benefits paid to any children that are entitled. And the same is true with marriages. We ask a lot of information about marriages. We will ask, are you currently married? Do you have any prior marriages? Did that marriage end? In divorce? If it did, did it last longer than 10 years? Do you have any marriages that ended because the spouse passed away? And again, just depending on how you answer those questions, that will indicate to Social Security whether we need to get additional information because you could be entitled to benefits off of someone else's record or someone else could be entitled to benefits off of your record. So I'm going to transition into a survivor benefits. Again, a child or disabled child could receive survivor benefits off of mom or dad's record. But then we also have benefits available to widow widowers for divorced widow widowers, and these individuals can receive full benefits at their full retirement age. Or reduce benefits as early as age 60, as early as age 50 if they're disabled. Or at any age if caring for a child younger than 16 or disabled child and remarriage after age 60 will not affect those benefits. So when you pass away, your surviving spouse may, at full retirement age, receive 100% of the deceased workers unreduced benefit. Or as early as age 60. In that percentage would be 71 and a half percent of the deceased workers full benefit. And that's going to increase each month that the survivor waits. Up to 100% if they start collecting at full retirement age. So that means someone can claim survivor benefits at any age between 60 and full retirement age, and the amount they receive will just depend on how old they are at the time they start collecting. And again, remarriage after age 60 will not impact those benefits. I will give you an example of how survivor benefit, survivor benefits work. So let's say my husband and I, we are both collecting retirement benefits, and he's getting retirement benefits off of his own work records. So his monthly benefit is $2,000. And I'm also receiving retirement benefits off of my own record. And my monthly benefit is $1,500. And we're in our 70s. And he passes away first. What should I do? What will happen if he passes away first? I'm going to drop the 1500 I receive on my own record, and I'm going to start collecting the $2,000 that he was receiving. So you don't get both. You just get the higher of the two. And because I'm past my full retirement age, I will receive 100% of what he was getting at the time he started collecting. Now, if I were to pass away first, he's not going to collect benefits off of my record because it would be less money. So he's just going to continue to receive the $2,000 that he gets off of his own record. Sometimes individuals have a choice when they are entitled to both a survivor benefit and a retirement benefit, so that means they can start collecting one benefit first. And then switch over to the other benefit later on if that benefit amount is going to be higher. So, for example, someone could start collecting survivor benefits as early as age 60 and then switch over to retirement benefits on their own record as early as age 62. Or they could wait up until age 70 or start collecting somewhere in between, just depending on what that benefit amount is going to be. Another option would be to take retirement benefits as early as age 62 and then switch over to survivor benefits at a later date if that benefit amount is going to be higher and the maximum survivor benefit rate is payable somewhere between age 62 and full retirement age. So to gather this information again, to get benefit estimates for your retirement benefits that is available online through your My Social Security account. But if you wanted to get estimates for survivor benefits, you would want to reach out to your local office to get that information. Hillary, this is great stuff. Hey, just a reminder for everybody. In the bottom portion of your screen, there should be a little thing for a Q and a box. If you have questions that want Hillary to answer or that you just or top of mind, feel free to drop them in that Q and A box and we'll be sure to get to them either throughout the content, in the presentation, or at the very end. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Yes, please ask questions. I know it's a lot of information and it's a short amount of time, so I pack a lot of information in, so please ask questions. I'm going to talk a little bit about working while receiving benefits. And first, I want to talk about the numbers that you see on your screen. So when we talk about working while receiving benefits and the earnings limit. So that 23,400, the 62,160, this is income from work. So that's all that we're looking at. That's what is included in the earnings limit. Income from work. We're not counting any sort of pension 401 IRA distributions. We're just looking at income from work. And I also want you to know that when we talk about receiving a benefit before your full retirement age and continuing to work in, these earnings limits being in place, it's all benefits. So these earnings limits are in place whether you're receiving a retirement benefit on your own record, a spousal benefit, an ex spousal benefit, a survivor benefit. Sometimes individuals, when they're entitled to both a survivor benefit and a retirement benefit, they may decide, okay, I'm going to start collecting that survivor benefit at age 60, and then I'm going to wait to collect my retirement benefit until I'm full retirement age. But if you're still working full time and you're, you know, well over this $23,400 limit, you're not going to want to start collecting that survivor benefit at age 60 because it's very possible you won't even be due of benefit. So just something to keep in mind, but for individuals this year that are under full retirement age, that earnings limit is $23,400. That's gross wages. If you earn more than this. Then Social Security will withhold $1 for every $2. You may go over the limit. If this is the year someone is reaching full retirement age, that earnings limit is $62,160. If they go over this amount. So Social Security will withhold dollar for every three dollars they make over this amount. And then the month you reach full retirement age and continuing there is no earnings limits. I want to talk a little bit about. We call it our special earnings limit rule. And this applies to the first year that someone files for Social Security benefits. So it's called the special earnings limit rule, but it's really a monthly earnings limit. So if we look at someone that is under full retirement age, let's say they're going to be filing for Social Security benefits this year. If you look at that 23,400, you know, that's the annual earnings limit. But underneath that is a smaller amount in parentheses, the 1950s. This is the monthly earnings limit. And again, this only applies to the first year someone files. So let's say someone's under full retirement age. They're filing for benefits this year. They want their benefits to start in October. So they've been working full time. They want their benefits to start in October. If they have been working full time. They have probably already made over the 23,400. So does that mean they can't file? The answer is no. We don't really care how much they make from January through September because they're not collecting Social Security benefits. But starting in October, when they start collecting, and then through the end of the year, so October, November, December, they have to stay under the monthly earnings limit, the 1950s gross. If they go over that amount, they are not due their Social Security benefit for that month. The following year. So now we're on year two of collecting that 23,400, which will likely be a little higher next year. We don't care if they make all of that in one month or if it's over the course of six months. It's just that if they go over that amount, Social Security is going to withhold $1 for every $2 they make over that amount. So, for example, let's say someone makes $10,000 over the limit, so that means we would withhold $5,000 from their monthly benefit. If their monthly benefit is $1,000 a month, that means we're going to withhold five months of benefits. Typically, individuals will ask, well, do I get that money back? The answer is, no, you do not get that money back. But once you reach full retirement age, we are going to recalculate your benefits and we are going to give you credit for any month that we withheld your benefit due to work, and that's going to result in a higher monthly Social Security benefit moving forward. But we don't do that recalculation until you hit full retirement age. Social Security benefits in taxation. Will your Social Security benefits be taxed? Probably. It's based on your combined income, and the IRS defines combined income as your adjusted gross income plus non taxable interest plus half of your Social Security benefit. So if you file a joint return in, your combined income is between 32,000 and 44,000. You have to pay income tax on up to 50% of your benefits. That's more than 44,000. Up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable. And then as an individual, if you're combined income is between 25,000 and 34,000, you have to pay income tax on up to 50% of your benefits. More than 34,000, up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable. When you are collecting Social Security benefits, you do have the option to have taxes withheld. There's four different percentages that you can choose from, but this is it's voluntary. You don't have to. But that option is available. So I'm going to briefly touch on Medicare. Social Security does not administer the Medicare program, but we do enroll individuals into Part A into Part B. So that's why we typically will talk a little bit on Medicare in the enrollment period. S. So there are other parts of Medicare, like the Part D prescription drug plans Medigap policies, Medicare Advantage plans. Individuals can enroll into those plans. They just do it outside of Social Security. But first you have to sign up for original Medicare the Part A and the Part B before you enroll into those other plans. In knowing your enrollment period when to enroll is really important because if you don't sign up for Medicare when you should, there could be a penalty, and that penalty sticks with you for the entire duration of having Medicare. So Medicare eligibility starts at age 65. For individuals who are already receiving a Social Security benefit. Prior to age 65. They are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. So those individuals don't have to do anything because they're already collecting a Social Security benefit when they turn 65. Now for individuals who are not collecting a Social Security benefit. If they in their turning 65, they can enroll during the special enrollment period. Now, just because you are turning 65 doesn't necessarily mean that you need Medicare. But if you do, the initial enrollment period begins three months before your 65th birthday, the month you turn 65, and then it ends three months after your birthday. So that's when you can enroll in part A and part B. Part A is free. Part B has a premium attached to it. If you are someone who may not need Medicare because you may not need Medicare when you're turning 65, that would likely be because you have coverage through your current employer or your spouse's current employer. So we're going to tell individuals while you still want to double check and make sure you don't have to enroll, make sure that the coverage you have is going to continue to be primary. If that's the case, you don't have to enroll right now and there's not going to be a penalty for you for enrolling later on because you have that coverage. And that makes sense because Part B has a premium attached to it. So if they are already paying for insurance, it would make sense not to enroll in Part B to pay that premium. So sometimes individuals will enroll in Part A because it's free. But if you have an hsa, you can no longer contribute to the hsa. When you have Medicare, you can still use the funds in the hsa, but you can no longer contribute. So typically, that's why individuals would wait to enroll in part A as well as if they have an hsa. And then they would wait to enroll in Part B because they're covered through their current employer or their spouse's current employer. So those individuals can enroll later on during the special enrollment period. And that's for individuals 65 or older. They've been covered under a group health plan based on their current work or their spouse's current work. When they enroll in Medicare, there is a form that they will complete and there is a section that their employer or their spouse's employer completes verifying that they had coverage. And by doing that, there's not going to be any penalty to them for enrolling after age 65. Now, there's some individuals that don't enroll it at age 65, and they didn't have coverage, and that's okay. They can still enroll during the general enrollment period. However, the penalty, it's a 10% penalty for every 12 months that has lapsed when they should have signed up for Medicare and did not in that penalty. It's based on whatever the Part B premium amount is. So for this year, the standard Part b premium is $185. Now, higher wage earners do have to pay higher premiums. Those premium amounts are based on the tax return that you filed to your prior. So, for example, for this year, the standard premium amount those individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less. Married couples $212,000 or less. They are paying the standard premium, the 185 per month per person. If you look at the next income Berkadia up. Individuals above 106 up to 133. Couples above 212 up to 266. They're paying that 185 per month plus an additional $74 per month per person. Now, again, we're looking at the tax return that was filed two years prior. When we are determining what the premium amount is going to be. But if you're modified, adjusted gross income changes, that means the premium amount could change as well. Maybe at the time you and your spouse are start receiving Medicare, both of you are working full time. Maybe one of you retires so the adjusted girls income is less. That's one way that the premium would be adjusted. How you apply for benefits. If you want to file for retirement benefits, spousal benefits, disability, Medicare, all of those applications can be completed online. The only benefit application that cannot be completed out, cannot be completed online that we talked about is the benefits for survivors. So the survivor benefits, you would have to file an appointment for everything. Else can be done online. However, if you do not want to apply online, you do not have to. But you do need to schedule an appointment. So if you call our $800 number, you can schedule an appointment. The appointment will be with someone from your local Social Security office. Most appointments are completed over the phone. However, if you would prefer to go in face to face for that appointment, you can certainly do so. You do have that option. You can apply for benefits up to four months before you want your payments to start. Keep in mind, benefits are paid the month after they are due. So if you indicate on your application that you want your benefits to start in October, the October benefit is going to come in November. So next I'm going to talk about the MY Social Security account and just show you where you can go to get some information about your retirement benefits, to get estimates, and really to use your MY Social Security account as a financial planning tool when you're thinking about when to file for Social Security benefits. So if you go to our website SSA.gov@ the very top you will see a little box that says sign in where that red arrow is. And that's where you will sign in or create a my Social Security account. So in order to sign in or create an account, we have two credentialing partners that we use, and that's login.gov or ID me. So you would have to create an account with login.gov or ID me in order to get access to your My Social Security account. This is how we verify your identity. So you can choose whichever one you want and you would follow the prompts, create a username and password and then once you have that, the Next time you want to log into your My Social Security account, you still go to SSA.gov and then you would select either sign in with login.gov, sign in with ID me, put in your username and password, or your email and your password, and then you'll have access to that My Social Security account. If you are already receiving benefits and you have a MY Social Security account, this is where you can go to update your contact information. So you can update your phone number, your email address, your address. You can change your direct deposit information. Maybe you need to get benefit verification letter as proof that you're getting benefits. One of the things that individuals will access their My Social Security account for pretty frequently is when they file for Medicare. So they file for Medicare A and B and then they get a Medicare ID number, and they need to use that Medicare ID number in order to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. But they don't want to wait for that ID number to come in the mail. If they have a MY Social Security account, they can get that ID number right away. So then they can enroll into a supplemental plan, if that's what they choose to do. For individuals not receiving benefits by having them my Social Security account. This is where you can go to get benefit estimates at different ages or dates of when you want your benefits to start. Once you file, you can check the status of your application. You also have access to your Social Security statement. This might look familiar to some of you. This is something that we used to mail out to everyone every year. Now, the statement only goes to individuals age 60 or older not receiving benefits and who do not have an online account. The rest of us can access our statement through our online account. I know there's a lot of financial planners that will ask their clients to provide the Social Security statement to them as a starting point when it comes to retirement planning. And there's a lot of great information on the statement. It gives you estimates on your retirement benefits at different ages. It'll give you an estimate. For disability benefits, for survivor benefits. So if you were to pass away, how much could a survivor receive off of your record? And then it also gives you information about your earnings record. It's really important to check that earnings record information, especially for any year there that shows a zero and should not be, because any benefit you receive from Social Security is based on how much you've worked and paid into Social Security. So if you do see a discrepancy there, you can either contact your local office or you can upload the information through your My Social Security account. So that would be like your tax return a 1099. Like whatever you may have to show your earnings for that year. W2, you can upload that to your my Social Security account to get that earnings record corrected, but with the Social Security statement. It's a really good starting point, gives you good information, but it is somewhat limited. So, for example, if you look at the earnings chart there, it tells you your benefit amount at age 62, at age 63 and so on. But you might be someone who decides. You might want to know, well, how much is my benefit I age. 66 and two months. You don't get that from the statement, but you can get that from your my Social Security account. Also, the amounts that you see on your statement are making the assumption you are going to continue to work up until that age, but you might be someone who's going to stop work at 62, but not start collecting until 67. So again, that's a limitation on the statement, but it's available through your My Social Security account. So right when you log into your account, you're going to see something similar to this, the retirement calculator. And this is where you can change the age. Or the date of when you want to start collecting. You can put in an average future annual salary. You can change that to zero. This is how you can run those different scenarios to determine how much your monthly benefit is going to be. So my last slide here, this just has contact information, a lot of great information on our website, SSA.gov that's where you log into your my Social Security account. We have our 800 number there. And then if you want to find the contact information for your local office, if you go to ssa.gov locator. You can put in your zip code and then your local contact information will come up. So I'm guessing we have some questions that came in. You'd be right about that. Hillary, thank you so much. Very comprehensive. Wonderful job. Yeah, we have some questions here. Let's just start from the top. If somebody were to apply for survivor benefits, what information with the Social Security Administration need or how should that person best go about that? So to apply for survivor benefits again, that's something you can't do online, so I would Suggest calling our 800 number. Or you can call your local office directly to schedule an appointment. What are going to need is they will need proof of marriage. So like the marriage license, if you're filing from a divorced as a divorced spouse and that spouse has passed away, we would also need the divorce decree. Most of the time we already have the information about the death, so we don't typically need the death certificate. We would need basic information you're going to know just off the top of your head. But as far as the documents that we would need, it would most likely be the marriage license and then if there is a divorce involved, the divorce decree as well. All right. Thank you. Let's just say that somebody works at an employer where they're giving an early packages or retirement incentives to people. How would the Social Security Administration view those dollars as part of a retirement package? Are they seen as? How do they look at that? Is that due to income? Is it subject to the earnings limit, so on and so forth? Yeah. So most likely it's going to be counted as so we call it a special wage payment.

### You (2025-09-03T16:47:09.305Z)

So we called a special wage payment.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:47:12.104Z)

And it would not be counted as part of the earnings limit. So, for example, if you file, or let's say you're retiring from your employer in June, and then in July or August, you get some sort of payout, whether it's like vacation, sick leave, whatever it may be, we would consider that a special wage payment, and that would not be included when we're looking at the annual earnings limit. So if you wanted more information on that, if you go to our website SSA.gov and you can just type in special wage payment and there'll be a fact sheet that will come up that will go into more details on that and give examples.

### You (2025-09-03T16:47:12.425Z)

And it would become. Some sort of. Special.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:47:55.624Z)

Okay. And then kind of staying on topic about the earnings limit. Somebody asked, is there a point where it goes away and we can earn more while collecting Social Security benefits, or does that limit always enforced. So the limit is always enforced. Until you reach full retirement age. So the month you reach full retirement age and continuing, there is no earnings limit. But every year prior, that earnings limit is enforced. Okay? Let's see here. If somebody had applied for benefits. Do they have the ability to put those benefits on hold or stop them or reinstate them at a later date? So once you apply for Social Security benefits, If you decide I actually don't want to receive benefits. You can withdraw the application, and you can do that within 12 months of when you filed, but any benefits that you received would have to be repaid. Another. I mean, it's going to depend on the situation. So if the reason that you want to stop your benefits is because, let's say you're going to go back to work and you've already been collecting for over a year, or maybe you just don't have you've been collecting for six months, but you can't pay back those benefits. So you would reach out to your local office and you would let us know that you're going to go back to work and we're going to put in an estimate on your record, and we're going to make it a high enough estimate. Where it would stop those Social Security benefits.

### You (2025-09-03T16:49:08.345Z)

Situation. So if the reason. Is because. You can't pay back those benefits. So you can reach out to your local office. If you. 're going to go back to work.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:49:40.104Z)

And then you were to stop work or reduce work or something, reach back out to us and just depending on those dollars amounts,

### You (2025-09-03T16:49:45.545Z)

Reach back out to us.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:49:49.464Z)

Then the benefits would be reinstated. Okay? Moving along here. Can I collect for my ex husband if I was married to to them for 20 plus years and am now remarried. My now husband is retired but I am working full time. That's a great question. And the answers no. You can not collect from your ex husband because you are remarried now. Let's say the person you're married to. Now, if you were to get divorced or if that person were to pass away, then it's possible you could receive benefits off of your ex husband. But we're going to determine what benefit would pay you the highest. So, for example, if you're someone that has had two previous marriages, you don't get to collect from both. You would be able to collect from the highest of the two. Okay? Great. So about timing here of Social Security. So let's just say somebody wanted to start their benefits in January of 2026. Does that mean that they would need to apply and say, October, and then they'd be paid out in February? How would that, you know, if they're looking to, you know, again, if they want to start receiving benefits January 1st of 26, when should they apply? So the earliest that you can apply is four months before you want your benefits to start. You don't need four months to apply. I mean, you could, because we also pay a month behind. So if you, if you indicate on the application you want your benefits to start in January, the January benefit is going to come in. February. So if you applied in December, indicating you want your benefits to start in January, that's going to be enough time for you to get that benefit, that January benefit, because it's coming in February. But you can apply a little bit sooner if you feel like you'd like to do that. But the soonest you can apply is, or the earliest you can apply is four months in advance. Here's a tech related question. Somebody's having some trouble signing in to their account for a variety of reasons. Maybe they email's wrong or doesn't recognize it or the phone number. Doesn't recognize it. Is there an alternate way that they should go about that, or is there a someplace they should call? So there is not an so you have to have a login.gov or an ID me account in order to get into your My Social Security account if you're having trouble logging in you would want to reach out to either login.gov or ID me, whichever one that you're using. I've heard that ID me is a little bit easier to utilize, so if you're using login.gov and you're having difficulty, you could try id me. Otherwise, you would want to reach out directly to login.gov. we do have people that call us all the time and they'll say, I can't log in. And we have to refer them to log. If you go to their website, if you just go to login login.gov, you will be able to find, like, the contact us option, and there should be a phone number available. Great. Do they take taxes out of my Social Security? What age can you withdraw from a 401A account or maybe 401K? I can answer that part real quick. Generally speaking, it's 15. Age 59 and a half. When you can withdraw. There are maybe some stipulations around that, but generally speaking, it's that age. So taxes. Taxes. So it's going to be whether or not you have to pay taxes on your Social Security benefits. It's going to be based on whatever your combined income is. Most likely, you're going to have to pay taxes on your benefits. You can have taxes withheld from your Social Security benefits if you want. To. There's four different percentages to choose from. And I think the percentages might be like 7%, 10%, 12 and 15. But don't quote me on that. But you can have taxes withhelds from your benefits, but it's optional if you do that or not. Okay? Talking about benefits here. If somebody wanted to get the maximum amount of benefit, what would be the minimum amount of earnings? For. Call it 35 years of working that somebody would have to hit. So every year we. There is a. It changes every year. So your earnings are taxed up to a certain amount. You're paying Social Security taxes up to a certain amount, and you would have to hit that max.

### You (2025-09-03T16:54:48.345Z)

Your earnings are taxed up to a certain amount, you're paying Social Security taxes up to a certain amount, then you would have to hit that map every single year.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:54:57.144Z)

Every single year in order to get the on those high 35 on 35 years in order to get the highest Social Security benefit possible. I don't know what the max is off the top of my head for this year, but let's say it's probably around $173,000 for this year. So if you have hit the made at least the max for 35 years,

### You (2025-09-03T16:54:58.985Z)

In order to get.

### Guest (2025-09-03T16:55:24.424Z)

Then that's how you would be able to receive the highest Social Security benefit that we could pay out. Okay? Here's another question. So if I stopped working somewhere between age 65 and 70, And I'm not filing for Social Security until a full retirement age. Let's assume that's age 67, maybe. Is it important that you will for Medicaid? Or that you will maybe file for Medicaid. Before. Three months after turning 65, maybe this person. Maybe I can follow up with this person. I think I understand what they're saying. So you might not be ready to file for Social Security until you're older, but you're eligible for Medicare at 65. So you're asking, even though I'm not going to collect my Social Security at 65, do I have to file for Medicare at 65? And it's going to depend if you have coverage through your current employer or your spouse's current employer. You don't have to file for Medicare. You can wait to file until later on. Tell either when you or your spouse retires and you're not going to have that coverage, or for whatever reason, if you are going to continue to have that coverage but you want file, you can do that at a later date without any sort of penalty. Wonderful. All right, let's see. I am divorced after a 20 plus year marriage and I will be turning 62 this month. I have since remarried. My ex husband has retired and has not remarried. Could you please clarify again whether I am still eligible to receive Social Security benefits based on his record? You cannot receive benefits from your first husband's record because you are remarried, so you cannot receive benefits off of his record because you are remarried. Okay? And the last question here, if I pull from my 401k from age 60 to 67, Is that considered income towards the 35 years? It is not. It's not considered income for the 35 years. And then when we look at the earnings limit, It's not part of the earnings limit when we're determining did you make too much money and your Social Security is going to withhold something because you're over the income limit. We call it the annual earnings test. It doesn't count for that either. Perfect. Wow, Hillary, you've done such a good job. I'm just reading the comments here in the Q and A box. And you're getting a lot of praise. Sounds like everybody's gotten a lot out of this. We'll be sure to do things like this. In the future, of course. Hopefully Hillary can make some time for everybody. Next year as well. We'll be sure to ask just again if you guys have any other questions. Generally speaking, Feel free to direct them towards me. And I can reach out to Hillary to get a specific answer in your question. Like I said, this is going to be recorded. It'll be distributed to you. Again. If you have any questions, please let us know. But thank you so much for taking an hour out of your day to spend with. Hi, I'm zach. The founder and CEO of warp. Agents create a lot of code that almost works.

### You (2025-09-03T17:02:47.385Z)

It almost works. Best case, it all works perfect.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:02:48.904Z)

Best case, it all works perfectly. Worst case, you take down Prod. Even with the best coding agents like Warp. Engineers still need to steer agents in a tight feedback loop. Prompt, plan, review, edit, test and repeat until your code is ready to ship.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:04.025Z)

Plan, review, edit, test, repeat. So your code is ready. Let me show you how we support that work.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:08.504Z)

Let me show you how we support that workflow with Warp's newest coding features. When you open Warp, you're able to pick up work on an existing project or start a new one.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:13.065Z)

Are you open more, you're able to pick up existing project or start a new one.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:18.184Z)

Projects have Warp MD files in code based context enabled, and if you already have an Agents MD cloud, NMD or cursor rules, Warp can use that as well. In this case, I'll continue a project where I'm adding support for opening files using the editor variable.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:18.185Z)

Projects have warped that ND files and code based context enabled. If you already have an HSNM cause energy or cursor rules. Or can use that as well. In this case, I'll continue a project where I'm adding support for opening files using the editor variable. This is a top user request, so to get up to speed, I ask the agent to explain what it's done so far.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:31.384Z)

This is a top user request. So to get up to speed, I ask the agent to explain what it's done so far.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:38.345Z)

I scan all the data generated gifts.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:38.504Z)

I scan all the agent generated diffs in our new diff view.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:40.265Z)

And are you?

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:42.104Z)

And I run terminal commands to build the project and see where it's at.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:42.585Z)

Terminal Command project. See where it's at. Our auto detection, which we've recently approved. Detective. User commands not aided. Props.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:03:45.704Z)

Our auto detection, which we've recently improved, text that these are commands, not even prompts. Uh oh, there's a crash that happens. Having worked a lot on this code base is just something I happen to know a bit better than the agent and instruct the agent on how to make the fix. I referenced the code from Warp's diff view and provide more context by referencing specific files using the.

### You (2025-09-03T17:03:54.425Z)

Having more to love on this co basis is something I happen to know better than the agent and struck the agent on how to make effects. I referenced the code from Warp's dip view to provide more context by referencing specific files. Using the app.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:15:56.584Z)

In today's world, there's an infinite demand for insights, and data teams just can't keep up.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:01.945Z)

Often toilet so repetitively. Major sleep of the business.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:02.024Z)

Often dealing with tooling that's so fragmented that can't efficiently meet the needs of the business.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:07.305Z)

Team has went to the house single Berends another supposed to do to moderate in Python. Then two more tools for visualization to be reported. This creates lag.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:07.384Z)

Teams might have one tool to handle SQL queries, another tool to do some modeling in Python. Then two more tools for visualization and reporting. This creates a sort of lag. In the data workflow, wasting a lot of time. And a lot of money.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:19.625Z)

And learn money.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:22.984Z)

Which can be extremely stressful. Wouldn't it be easier if everything was all in one place?

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:23.065Z)

Which can be extremely stressful. Texas, the only comprehensive, unified platform.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:29.704Z)

Hex is the only comprehensive, unified platform for building with data.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:31.785Z)

For building data. In the hex universe.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:35.464Z)

In the Hex Universe, the fundamental building blocks are bite sized units called cells. They can be made out of Sequel Python.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:37.545Z)

Are eyesight units, call cells.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:16:44.264Z)

Charts, even self serve. Since they're all in the same environment, cells can talk to each other and share information, so switching between different modalities feels effortless and more natural.

### You (2025-09-03T17:16:49.865Z)

Since they're all in the same environment, south can talk to each other. Information, so pushing between different modalities feels effortless and more natural.

Finish Data projects can even be shared in the form of a digestible app that anyone can view and interact with.

### You (2025-09-03T17:17:00.505Z)

Finish data project can you share in the form of identifiable app that anyone can view and interact with?

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:17:06.104Z)

And I mean really interact with. Every table and chart can be explored from the finished app so viewers can answer any follow up questions that they'll likely have. This minimizes the frequency of minor requests the data team so that they can focus on delivering deeper insights.

### You (2025-09-03T17:17:06.425Z)

And I really interact with every table in charge can be explored from the first app. So people can enter a phone question that don't let me have. This minimizer is a frequency of underwrites. But include so that they can focus on delivering deeper insights. Start building without boundaries.

### Guest (2025-09-03T17:17:21.544Z)

Start building without boundaries. At hex.
