# Transcript for: HOLD: rescheduled Admin call

### You (2025-09-08T13:01:21.779Z)

Good morning.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:01:23.589Z)

Good morning.

### You (2025-09-08T13:01:24.819Z)

How are you doing today?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:01:26.229Z)

I'm okay. How are you?

### You (2025-09-08T13:01:28.579Z)

Doing well.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:01:29.749Z)

Thanks for joining me an hour early. Sorry about the last minute notice.

### You (2025-09-08T13:01:34.099Z)

No worries.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:01:36.869Z)

Okay, so I know you guys sent me some updates to the budget. And I am going to work on that and getting that out to Drew and to Mark. Everything that we talked about by tomorrow on our call. If that's all right.

### You (2025-09-08T13:01:53.299Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:01:53.509Z)

Okay? Encourage that Mark is diving into the pitch book. Shows that he takes ownership of it. Right. And so I took your advice. I did not include. Well, I did include a TAM slide, but I really didn't put any numbers on the TAM slide. Right. I just put, like, why? It's a big market. I did include an ARR slide. Even though Drew didn't want me to, because I feel like you have to have some numbers in there, like, and it's such a generic slide anyway.

### You (2025-09-08T13:02:31.059Z)

I agree. I don't know why he would push back on that.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:02:36.309Z)

Yep. But we'll see. I mean, well, we'll figure it out, the five of us. The only other thing I on the pricing. What I did was I took your, like, high SaaS pricing, but on the high level because it's hotel and hotel is complex. And then I said, all right, then quickly move to. Which was what you said to T shirt pricing. Right? Like small, medium, large. And then I put a third step, which is as we add modules that are more AI driven. Than try to take advantage of AI pricing hikes, right? Like, you know, like Perplexity. How it went from $20 a month to $200 a month.

### You (2025-09-08T13:03:24.019Z)

Don't put any dollar amounts in those if you can, because I've been doing a really deep dive into AI pricing.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:03:27.589Z)

I didn't put any dollar amounts. And then.

### You (2025-09-08T13:03:38.179Z)

And it almost seems like it has to be usage based, like we have to wonder how much is out there.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:03:42.949Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T13:03:48.499Z)

So if somebody uses deep research, which takes a ton of resources, Their bill is going to be a little bit higher. But there are a lot of examples where a lot of these startups have gone with fixed pricing. And one of the examples, I mean, it's probably extreme, but they were saying they charged like $50 a month and their bill was like $3,000. Because we would be the ones that connect to whether it be OpenAI anthropic. We'd have an API. So the request comes to us. We go through, we get charged by whatever provider we use. And then the results go back. Right, so we're like an intermediary. So we can charge them a fixed fee, but we may incur if they start putting together huge queries. So that's what I've been working on last couple weeks.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:04:55.509Z)

Is there a way you can. Like, we, as the intermediaries, can monitor that. Almost like you. You know, like when you. When you sign up a consultant and you say, okay, if you get to. You know, if you're starting to get to 10k, you need to tell me, because, yeah, you can do that.

### You (2025-09-08T13:05:09.619Z)

Yeah. We would be able to measure the data that goes back and forth.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:05:16.309Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T13:05:17.779Z)

So that is something that we could do as well, is charge a certain rate up to X amount of queries. Or terabyte. Well, however we want to do it. And then if they go over, we can do a charge as well. That's actually one of the most popular pricing, because that way they know that they have a fixed price each month that they can count on. But if there are special circumstances, That they go beyond it would cost more.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:05:52.149Z)

Okay? And then I just concluded that we'd be eventually, like, you know, and when I say eventually, I'm talking, like three to five to seven years out, right? I don't want to freak anyone out about, like, that this is gonna happen in the first year. We just go slow and careful during the first year. Make sure that we have good beta clients, we build a good base product, right? We have happy clients and that, you know, that maybe have some scale to them so we can get some revenue. That could get to us about 500k. And then we'll figure out from there. So I don't want to freak anyone out, like with. With a vision, because that's a long, long term vision. But then I ended the pricing that we would eventually move to a transaction platform and we would charge off of Aum. So that's how I set it up.

### You (2025-09-08T13:06:43.459Z)

Yeah, that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:06:45.509Z)

And then everything else in it. I mean, Mark is free to change if he wants to. He'll probably have Drew run it by. Run it through his AI Program. And then. Yeah, and then we'll go from there. I would love to have this pitch book done by end of the week. Because this is what's holding up now, the fundraising, right, is we have to have those pitch book, and then we get through the pitch book, and then we sit down as a group and really force actual plan around outreach on the fundraising. You know what I mean? Like, we're gonna call this person on this date. Does this make sense? Like, because Drew and Mark feel like I'm going rogue a little bit, and I'm, like, feeling like they're not doing enough. So now that we have the pitch deck, Okay, if we're all going to be aligned on who we're talking to, we actually need the names on a piece of paper. Who's calling who on, you know what I mean? To, like, start to, like, try to monitor or push the fundraising as much as we're pushing the node on the mvp.

### You (2025-09-08T13:07:52.899Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:07:55.269Z)

What else do I have? I'm really excited for you guys to see this Pulse demo. I think it's on Thursday, I think. Or maybe it's on a Tuesday. I forget now. But I think it could really make our product. Look even as it is now, just look so much more than it is because of this interactive deck concept, right? And the photos and the visuals. But again, we can talk about that and if we all agree that if we like it or not, And then the last thing I have is there was something. There was a data platform and you shared it and you'd said, oh, we could actually just use this for our database. And it had a name. It was like, simple. Is this for call? Are you recalling this? It was an actual database structure that you could use.

### You (2025-09-08T13:08:56.339Z)

For.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:08:56.949Z)

Data for our data model.

### You (2025-09-08T13:09:00.179Z)

Okay? I do not, because I know.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:09:04.389Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T13:09:09.379Z)

The node has got everything set up on Amazon web service, AWS.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:09:16.309Z)

Okay. All right.

### You (2025-09-08T13:09:17.779Z)

The only thing. Well. If you can. Was it an email or something?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:09:25.029Z)

Yeah, it was either an email or it was a team's message.

### You (2025-09-08T13:09:29.379Z)

If you find something, maybe it'll. Because I don't remember. Because I don't think I would suggest switching our database, but maybe it might have been. Like our CRM database. Something specific. Not really specific to our model, but something. I would like to see it because. I apologize. Number one, my memory is very bad. Number two, I've been looking at so many different. I send things to you. I send things to the node. It's like, hey, cool. Look at this new toy.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:09:53.749Z)

Y. Eah. I know, I know. Yeah. Yeah. And I just need to go carefully back through. I remember when, but I was so focused on, man, that deck. For as short as it is, it took so long, I just couldn't get it. I hope Mark does a good job of, like, making it more succinct, because it was really, really hard. To put that together.

### You (2025-09-08T13:10:30.739Z)

Yeah. I know. It's like you feel like you have to tell everybody everything, but then all of a sudden, you end up with way too much. And by the time your three slides in, they're dozing off.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:10:43.349Z)

Yes. Yes. Drew's like, no, we don't put any real words. We just put, like, little titles. And I'm like, more like, I need. I need content, you know? So to me, I'm like, what? Like, that's. Well, never remember anything. We have to tell them something. But he's like, no, no, you don't do that.

### You (2025-09-08T13:11:04.339Z)

I think I just remember what it was. A delve for the soc 2. Okay. Yeah, for the soc 2 compliance. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:11:09.029Z)

Might have been delve. Was it a database? Is that a database?

### You (2025-09-08T13:11:16.579Z)

No. They will help companies. With obtaining SOC2 compliance, so they would be using our database. Or making sure we can comply, and they've got.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:11:28.309Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T13:11:33.699Z)

Just like everything else AI driven thing. You talk to people that say, oh, it takes months to do this, and you got to write everything down. Well, they claim they can do it in, like, a week. You have to get a proposal from them. So we could do that. In fact, it probably be a good idea to talk to them because I don't think we're anywhere near. Being able to start that process. I mean, we've got databases that haven't even been created yet that we need.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:12:12.229Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-08T13:12:13.379Z)

We could at least maybe get some idea what the cost would be.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:12:16.789Z)

Okay? Yeah, that. Right. And when it went to put that in our roadmap. Right. Like, that's truly like a 2020. We're almost at 2026 now. It blows my mind. By the 2027 thing,

### You (2025-09-08T13:12:34.259Z)

Yeah, it would not be in the six month budget, but after speaking to them, I mean, it could be last half of 2026 or early 2027. But. Yeah, let me. I don't have any idea. What they would need. To to do that.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:12:54.949Z)

And maybe. So what I did on the funding need was I said we were gonna. We were asking for three. We were gonna phase the precede. Into three rounds. The first round covers, like, six months. And I put 550k in there, which I know is a little high, just a bit higher than what we talked about. But I just felt like when we started to add, like, the AI, you know, people we don't really know yet, some of these costs. So I felt. I felt more comfortable with 550 than 500. And then I put that takes us through March, and then in March, we're gonna go out and look for 1.5. So that's two, and then. 0.5 or 2. I maybe was 2 million. So that's 2.5. And then I put another million after that. I think 2.0. It's 4.5 total. I need to go back and look at it. I'm sorry. I'm not being very articulate. But three phases. The first phase 550 and the other two are like a couple million to get us to 4.5 total pre seed capital, which then we would be ready to go to Series A funding. Is the logic behind that?

### You (2025-09-08T13:14:16.499Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:14:17.189Z)

In two and a half to three years.

### You (2025-09-08T13:14:18.579Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:14:19.829Z)

Right when our a Our is somewhere between two and a half and three and a half. Mil, probably.

### You (2025-09-08T13:14:27.219Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:14:28.869Z)

Does that sound? Who knows, right?

### You (2025-09-08T13:14:33.219Z)

Find me, it's like, yeah, you're way farther along on valuation than I am, so. I am. I'm sticking to my lane with the product, and I'll let you guys work on. But, yeah, I. I mean, yes, I will do everything I can to provide backup.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:14:39.749Z)

Okay? Y. Eah.

### You (2025-09-08T13:14:54.179Z)

And things like that, but, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:14:56.389Z)

Okay? I just wanted to let you know what I put in there. So you had a sense and you weren't surprised, like, Mark may be surprisingly, say, four and a half million, but I do that's. I mean, I've read so much and Drew has read a lot, too, but I feel like that is a good amount to say to get to precede funding and then you take that.

### You (2025-09-08T13:15:00.659Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:15:18.709Z)

For four and a half million. And you say that is essentially worth those investors that precede money, they get somewhere around 12 to 15% of the company for that. And then you grow it up and then that's how you actually determine. That's one way to determine your pre money value is based on the amount of precede capital you need.

### You (2025-09-08T13:15:40.419Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:15:43.989Z)

Just between Sherben and I are going back and forth on value. We have different ideas of what that is. He doesn't quite believe in the big vision. Right. He definitely is investing. But he and I still have to talk a little bit more about, like, the valuation because we're not on the same page there. But we will get. We. I will get there with him on positive of it.

### You (2025-09-08T13:16:08.499Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:16:12.949Z)

Mark had a. I don't know if he talked about this. But when he was at the Ah LA event last Tuesday night, he had some good conversations. Interestingly, it was the management, hotel management community that had the most interest and could see, like, the vision of it. The least interest came from small sponsors. Who were very reluctant to feel like they could give up their proprietary Excel model. Like, it was just too great. It was their secret sauce, right? But it was good to hear that. And one of the companies that feels really positive about this idea is First Hospitality, and they are family office owned by the Schwartz family. Right. So family office money could be a really great place for us. And so, you know, it's another potential use case or Persona that could invest as well. And they are really big into data, data analytics and things like that. On the management company side, And go ahead.

### You (2025-09-08T13:17:24.979Z)

I was gonna say. I. I just want everybody to know. We're not going to close every sale, and you're gonna hear the whole thing about the proprietary Excel model. A lot. You know, I heard that at redIQ, there was one client that spoke of their proprietary Excel model. Over and over and thought, you know, they got the best model out there. They only wanted redIQ to process operating statements in rent rolls, then they would do the rest. And I got a glimpse at their model. It was basic. There's nothing at all special about it, but. But they don't know.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:18:13.349Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-08T13:18:17.859Z)

The only way to convince those is, you know, we'll get the early adopters out there. And one of the things we really want to focus on is turning those early adopters into evangelists and getting their testimonials on a website. And, you know, if you can get somebody who. Would specifically point out that. They were very happy with their Excel process. But InnVestAI took us up to the next level type of thing. Then we'll start chipping away at it. But, yeah, I mean, you will get some people who will die on that hill. And there's not much we can do about that.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:19:02.229Z)

Y eah. That's good advice. I know we're gonna get a lot of no's, so I'm preparing for mentally for that. I also. I'm kind of excited about this. I've been talking about Harvey. You guys probably so sick of me sending you things about Harvey, but Lem Watkins, they implemented an enterprise agreement with Harvey. And so I reached out to a woman that's a hotel attorney there. Her name is Megan Kochi, and she. And I are talking on Thursday, and I just wanna. It's like. It's research. Like, how are they gonna use Harvey? How could they envision having API integrations or AI agent relationships, right? So just to kick around the idea, like, for me to understand what Harvey is, more how they're using it. The security is gonna be like Fort Knox on that. So how will they essentially share workflows? Right. They'll have to share it with their clients for sure. So. But I'm excited because I think that you start to get into legal workflows, and then we're no longer just an avm. Right. And so for the people that say, oh, we start to become a bigger product as we start to tackle different. Adjacent workflows in the process. And then my last update is not a great one for me, but just so you know, because you're gonna see my time limited. I had to get a local retail job to pay groceries. And so I'm gonna be like, I have to go there today. I'll be there tomorrow. It's a lot. Of hours, but I have to do it to be able to work, to feed my family at this point. So my availability is gonna be spotty until we start to get the fundraising in place.

### You (2025-09-08T13:21:05.699Z)

Yeah. Yeah, well. I feel for you because I have tried to find something similar. Nearby. Unfortunately, I live in a small town. And. Just not a whole lot of part time jobs or anything like that available. I just had a hard time, but yeah, I'll probably be right behind you. Because I have had to dip into the IR at the ira.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:21:38.949Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T13:21:40.419Z)

Which did not go over well with my life.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:21:44.069Z)

Right. We had to do that, too. Yes. And so, yeah. And I guess I should feel I didn't feel lucky to have it because for a long time they just looked at my resume. You know what I mean? They looked at me and said, you want to work here? You know what I mean? It was almost an immediate. No. Based on my qualifications. But this job, they had a whole bunch of college kids leave to go back to college. And so I was able to get it, but I totally want to cry every time I go there. It's not bad work. Does that make sense? It's just like.

### You (2025-09-08T13:22:19.059Z)

Yeah, like this is not what I had planned.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:22:21.989Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-08T13:22:22.259Z)

Yeah. Well, we'll get there, though. I still am 110% behind this thing. I know it's gonna fly. We just got to get there.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:22:33.029Z)

Me too. Me too. And we got to get this, like, now we really need to narrow on raising 550k, right? Like, and just push through two months, get it done. You and I might need to brainstorm a little bit to. About what? Wherever Vinode is at the end of this month. Getting something, even if it's just the data upload, right? So that it's in a demo format. And it doesn't. It doesn't have to be the whole mvp. But if it's not the whole mvp, maybe there is a section on our site where we take screenshots of the POV and put them there. Does this make sense so that when we're doing the demo, we could just go, this is what it will look like when it's built out. This is in the PoC format, and since it's lovable, it would be stupid to just try to go back and forth. So screenshots, I think. Or maybe like a DAC or something, you know, like something that, you know, powers through to give the vision of what the AVM will look like when we get the working capital to finish it.

### You (2025-09-08T13:23:16.259Z)

Yeah. It's. It's very easy to do something like that. I mean, even. Even the data extraction. We could put together. Something with the PoC version because we already have a functioning upload in the begin. You can drag and drop a file and get it up there. It would. It would not take long at all. To have the node. Or his team. Connect to that data, upload, process the data, input it back. So you could actually do something like a demo in real time, because that really is the heart of the product. Without that, you've got nothing. With that, then you can do the core avm and then you can build out from there. So if you set, you know, this is, this is the, the number one time saver. Is you don't have to go through and copy and paste anymore. Or manually input. We can give you all this historical data and go from there. So let's see how they do. I know. He says he's making good progress on the data extraction itself. And we may not need to have the POC, because he's got to have the same price. He's already got the upload and everything, so there could be a point where we would just use what he's already built.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:25:16.229Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-09-08T13:25:16.659Z)

And so.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:25:18.869Z)

And so this is my big concern from a business perspective is Mark won't help help kick the can again and say, I'm embarrassed to show that he doesn't say that. Right. But he's not comfortable to write show it. And so we have to be like, dead on by the, you know, and. It doesn't them. VP I know it doesn't have to be finished at all, but like, we have to have something that we can show people and get Mark off that. You know, off that Objection. So we can move through the fundraising process.

### You (2025-09-08T13:25:52.579Z)

Yeah, I'm just wondering if I should start.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:25:54.149Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-08T13:25:56.979Z)

Maybe. Getting with Vinod. It wouldn't be too difficult for me to go in and change the look of the POC to more closely match what he has got for the mvp. There's no color wise, layout wise. He's putting it together to be very similar to the website so that when they go to the website, they click the button as a, you know, the client login button, that it doesn't all of a sudden boom. All of a sudden you've got this totally. Different design. And there are many, many fully functional features in the poc. So if I were to just change the look and feel the layout to match what Vinod is putting together. It would be very easy to do a demo on the poc. So we could show. It wouldn't be vaporware. It wouldn't be slides or mockups. It would be an actual functioning tool. The only difference is it's the POC is in lovable. Hours will be on our website. Function. Still the same. Doesn't matter. They don't care what website it's hosted on. So that's. That's something too we can think of if we. If it looks like we're going to miss the end of the month. Maybe by two to three weeks. Then you should start looking at using the POC for demos.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:27:37.669Z)

Because Mark is at the Phoenix lodging conference on October 6th. Right. So he is going to be with thousands of hotel people at that conference. And if he could have something on his computer that he can just, like, you know, quickly pop up or maybe on his iPad or. You know what I mean? Just that he could quickly show people and maybe like a one. Drew and I keep going back to this idea that we think people need a one pager. Just, you know, in my experience, people love to just have something all on. Just like, look, this is a page, right? And I'll just send this page to you. Like an infographic kind of thing. Which brings me back. How was your conversation with Carrie last week?

Good. I was gonna bring that up. Yeah, she. She emailed me a proposal that, based on our conversations, We talked about hourly or project based, and I think we both agreed that just hourly would be the easiest to go with. So she came back at $30 an hour, which is way less than I would have offered. I almost feel guilty saying, oh, yeah, you know, because I was thinking It'd be like 50 to 60 range. But I think she is willing to kind of lowball in order to have an opportunity to join full time. When the opportunity comes up, she's really excited about what we're doing. She really did enjoy working at redIQ, so I think she's kind of looking forward to the potential. So. But we also talked about the fact that, you know, we couldn't go $30 an hour for full time, so we were talking about capping it anywhere between five and ten hours a week. So we need to take a look and say, you know, could we afford anywhere from 150 to 300 a week? Sporadically. This would not. It would not be a steady 10 hours a week every week. I mean, there's gonna be a lot of work to do in order to get Mark prepared to get the logo out and everything, and then after that, It might died out until we have more to go, so. I don't know. If you want to wait until tomorrow's call, bring it up with the team.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:30:11.029Z)

Yeah, well, do that. We'll bring it up to. On tomorrow's call. Because this is like, well, we have to get the logo finalized, right? So, like, that. I just feel like somehow between Drew and Mark, if they've been splitting these costs that, you know, this is a cost that we have to incur.

### You (2025-09-08T13:30:28.099Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I would love to get started on that. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:30:33.349Z)

And maybe the infographic too, because that is just. It's hard to put it in infographic together. Like I can draw it on a piece of paper, but to actually do it in a, you know, in a. In a program isn't my expertise.

### You (2025-09-08T13:30:47.619Z)

Right. So I am. I've been playing middleman, trying to get her and Mark coordinated on a time kind of hard.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:30:57.349Z)

Ok?

### You (2025-09-08T13:30:59.299Z)

So hopefully we can get something she's got. I was hoping to get them together today or tomorrow. But she wasn't available until tomorrow. When I reached out to Mark, he said, yeah, anytime Monday or Tuesday afternoon would work. And, like, okay, I gotta try to figure this out, but hopefully, maybe he can get together with her on Wednesday. So after we have our call tomorrow, I think that'd be good. But, yeah, she's very excited, and I know she's got a bunch of ideas. That's one of the things that I. It's. It's a good problem to have, but I had to kind of back. I mean, she would. You'd ask her to do something and she'd come. Back with a pile of suggestions, and then she would go out on her own and say, hey, I thought about that. Which is. Which is wonderful, but, you know, sometimes you gotta steer them and keep them on track.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:31:56.789Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T13:31:58.099Z)

But, yeah, so, yeah, she'll do well.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:31:58.389Z)

I'm a little like that, too. Okay, great. And then maybe just to close out this conversation, something I've been thinking about is true. Sent me when we've been talking about valuation. He sent me the safe note that he has with Actus, his technology partner.

### You (2025-09-08T13:32:20.419Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:32:20.789Z)

And it turns out it's not actually a safe node. It's a promissory note. It's like he. They have real teeth. And they like he was in a different position when he had to negotiate that, and they took complete advantage of him in every single way. What's crazy is it's only for 45k. 2 was the amount of the promissory note. But the restrictions he's under are really significant. And so, you know, I've been thinking about this. All of that database structure lives an actus, right? Drew doesn't really control that. Right? I mean, for hotel biz. Am I right about that, or am I? Yeah.

### You (2025-09-08T13:33:04.179Z)

I don't know. I don't know the details of how it's set up.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:33:09.029Z)

Because you brought this up early on and I really did. Listen, it's like we may when we get to the point when we have digital feeds versus just dropping files into up like a portal when we actually have a real digital feeds from the operators. We may need to. It should come to us versus Drew. You're absolutely right about that. And we may need to remap the management company data against each other. Because he has 50, and that's amazing. But I don't know that Actus will ever let him use that for anything other than hotel biz. And maybe because he did it once, he can do it faster a second time. But I don't even know. Like, what if he's. If he has restrictions against that? You know what I mean? Like, it's. It seems more complicated than I had originally thought, so. But one of my walk away is the day when we start to get to the point where, like, if operators really love this idea and we can convince them to digitally send us the information. Right versus sending an Excel. We create agents or API integrations, and then it comes to us, and then we absorb it and do. Then do the work of essentially mapping it against each other, which isn't as well. I don't wanna. It's very tedious work. But we have a uniform system of account s. Right. So it's like we have something to work from, but it's still tedious work that will take us a while to recreate.

### You (2025-09-08T13:34:46.099Z)

It is. But when it comes to digitally receiving the data and putting in a database, that doesn't worry me one bit. That's basic process. So the database portion is not a problem. The mapping? Yes, it's tedious. But I've had to do things like that many times. Things blow, you start over or you do it. But every time, it's like, first off, you already know what you did the first time, so it's gonna be about half the time it did before. Also, I'm thinking with myself and Vinod working with Drew, we might be able to find things that we could do better. There's all for improvement, right?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:35:33.669Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-09-08T13:35:36.899Z)

So he has a good base, but I think we could build on that base.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:35:42.549Z)

I agree. I totally agree.

### You (2025-09-08T13:35:44.899Z)

Yeah. That's not something I would lose sleep over. It would just. It's just a bump in the road that we'd have to get past.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:35:52.949Z)

Okay? All right, so that's all I have for today, and then I'm gonna go to the grocery store. And be a cashier. So I'll be working all day today, and I have to work a lot this week, so again, my availability will be just much spottier than it has been.

### You (2025-09-08T13:36:12.659Z)

Understood? Understood?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:36:13.989Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-08T13:36:14.979Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:36:15.909Z)

All right. Talk to you tomorrow night.

### You (2025-09-08T13:36:17.539Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-08T13:36:19.029Z)

Bye.

### You (2025-09-08T13:36:19.219Z)

All right, we'll see.
