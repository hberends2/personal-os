Hi, everyone.

### You (2026-02-12T19:00:32.075Z)

Good morning.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:00:32.714Z)

How are you?

### You (2026-02-12T19:00:33.515Z)

Good. Doing well.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:00:34.394Z)

Good morning. Yeah, I'm doing great. Thanks.

### You (2026-02-12T19:00:39.115Z)

Good.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:00:41.194Z)

It's still cold on your side.

### You (2026-02-12T19:00:47.755Z)

Arctic glass is gone, so at least.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:00:50.794Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-02-12T19:00:50.875Z)

We're back up into reasonable. I guess if you want to call it reasonably cold. Not bitter cold. But I've had my fill of the cold winter this year.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:01:01.434Z)

Good. At.

### You (2026-02-12T19:01:04.155Z)

How's everything by you?

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:01:06.394Z)

Great. Yeah, I want to keep touch base here because. We are kind of gathering our kickoff a week ago. I'll discuss about the scope and everything and then how do we move forward? We have this idea, one thing is, before we bring someone else, We want to go the MVP before bringing someone else. So I really like your experience and your current prospective. But kind of delaying the decision, like in maybe two months from now, until we have the mvp, we really want to focus on that and avoid any other thing that could be a distraction. But I'm still very clear that I want to bring someone at some point.

### You (2026-02-12T19:02:02.715Z)

Go. Go.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:02:03.514Z)

Before transparent. I've been trying to figure out what's the right profile. And the ideal profile, the way I was envisioning that is someone who does not exist, but someone who has the skills. We have a background is working in a Treasury. For her property management or real estate company. That has also developed product from 0 to 1 that has a financial background and that is very quite savvy in terms of technology and AI and have a good understanding of all the world now in terms of the different concepts and be able to do some good vibe coding. We have lot of. Unanswer equation. I think it's the same for every company. Now is are we going to develop technology? And our product engineering, they're going to work together. So that's we are trying to figure out. It's evolving. And it's going fast. So, yeah, that person that I did find, that doesn't exist, really. I'm combining everything, so it's trying to find the right mix. And I think you have some of these that are very interesting. So I just want to kind of keep you warm. And as we move Howard our the next step, which is really building the MVP so that we can get that in front of two potential customer and further validate our vision. And at that point, we'll have a level of comfort that I think already have that, of course. But I need to confirm that with more facts so that we can have real discussion at a different level with property manager. So typically, the guy that you know that you reach out.

### You (2026-02-12T19:04:16.795Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:04:27.434Z)

Yeah, that. That kind of validation of the problem have. Have that. Done with many different CFOs. Treasurer in real estate. But not up to the point where I can show them. Okay, this is what. What look like. And then that's what I want to. I want to get to that point where I confirm in a more tangible way that we are building something that is amazing. And that's going to be the time now after that, too, okay? Now we are ready to accelerate. And grow the team with our employee or product owner number one, whatever we call it. So that's. That's going to be the right timing. I'm trying to. Very transparent in terms of what's. What's our thinking.

### You (2026-02-12T19:05:22.075Z)

That makes sense. I don't really have any questions at this point, but if you need any help, it's PoC or coding. Anything, just let me know. But I guess at this point, Let's keep in touch. And if you have any other things that I can help with, even beyond the poc, just let me know. But sounds like it's been sound like the Bosnian court. So I guess I will just wait to hear back from you.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:05:52.394Z)

Yeah, definitely. Yeah, let's actually reconnect as soon as I feel I'm ready. But nonetheless, feel free to reach out. I'm going to be a bit head down into the that I'm ready. So don't hesitate to hesitate to ping me on a regular basis and just check so I can give you an update. And if everything changed on on your side, the same thing, let me know.

### You (2026-02-12T19:06:23.195Z)

All right. We'll do.

### Guest (2026-02-12T19:06:24.714Z)

Okay? Cool. Thank you. Talk to you soon.

### You (2026-02-12T19:06:34.395Z)

Five.
