# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:31:12.696Z)

How was your weekend? Mine was. We were just helping out family like a friend to move to a new house. You were there for a few days. So all of us were there. Trying to settle them down. In a bigger house. Yeah, it's always a lot of work. Yeah, it was a lot of work, for sure. Howard. How was your weekend?

### You (2025-09-02T21:31:42.137Z)

That was pretty good. We spent some time at the cottage. But yeah, I was just mentioning to Diane this morning that saw an article where we had the most pleasant Labor Day weekend. On record. It was just perfect weather. Yeah. Like, low 70s and totally sunny. And then each day kind of got warmer by about 2 degrees. So yesterday is like 76. Couldn't ask or anything better. So. Yeah, it was beautiful. How about yours?

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:32:17.736Z)

Nice. Yeah. I was good. Sequoia national park.

### You (2025-09-02T21:32:27.417Z)

Nice.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:32:28.536Z)

With my family and then my brother in law and his family. So five girls under the age of 13 and then the four Berends and my mother in law. It was eventful.

### You (2025-09-02T21:32:42.057Z)

Now. That's up north, isn't it? Closer.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:32:44.696Z)

Yeah, it's like five hours. From here. Kind of closer to San Francisco, although just the way the mountains work, you really can't access it from San Francisco, which is kind of interesting.

### You (2025-09-02T21:32:58.297Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:33:01.016Z)

Yeah. And it was very hot. Definitely not the most pleasant weather we've had for Labor Day here was, like, very hot. But nice nonetheless. While we wait for Diane. I just followed up my questions that I was asking. What I'm going to suggest. Where did that go? Is that. We have like a. This is something I've done. I should say that my business partners and my business. Made me do. Made us do to keep us on track, and it's been useful. Just to have a set standard. Agenda that we go over. We have a weekly call every Monday at 9aM Pacific Time. And we just go over the same thing, like every week. And we have what we have on lbisi. It's got financials, customers.

### You (2025-09-02T21:33:54.457Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:34:07.096Z)

Revenue sales. Tech product and technology, and some of it has. Sometimes there's lots to say about particular things, sometimes there's nothing to say and it changes. But that way we have a consistent agenda to go through every week. And sort of loosely aligned by who owns what. So I own sort of. Operations. And product. Our cfo, obviously, on finance. And then our CTO owns technology on our side. It'll probably be a little bit different. Like, you guys will own product and technology. And I'll probably just own finance. Albeit there's not a whole lot right now and then same for Operations. And Mark really has been kind of responsible for owning the sort of customer investor relations. Activity at this point. And then each week I'll make a new tab here and. There'll be notes or whatever it is I might put. Maybe I'll put this on Smartsheet or. I would have thought there was, like, a really simple. I guess you can do Excel online inside of teams, so maybe I'll just do that. Instead of smartsheet. But I want something that we can all open up and look at. As well as discuss on our weekly calls.

### You (2025-09-02T21:35:38.217Z)

We also have the one note. In teams.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:35:43.176Z)

That's true. I do use OneNote a lot. Or started to use. It took a lot, but it doesn't have any. I want to be able to. Yeah, I guess at this point, there's not like, I don't think we need to go over the budget, the stuff that we were just talking about on teams. I don't think we need to discuss that. In that much detail on this weekly call, except in as much as to say that. We're on track from an expense perspective. We're going over or we're under or we need to add this to our expected expenses. Then that would be good.

### You (2025-09-02T21:36:24.857Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:36:25.976Z)

I'm trying to think about the best way to kind of track all of that and inconvenient place for everybody.

### You (2025-09-02T21:36:33.897Z)

In OneNote, you can embed an Excel spreadsheet. That's one thing. If we're going to be in the Microsoft system, OneNote really is a very good tool. It's very easy to embed links, and what I really like with OneNote is one of some of the advanced features. But you can actually put a link in OneNote that will take you to any other note, like right at the row you want it. So instead of just taking you to the sheet. You can insert a link that'll take you right to the first word and whatever row or paragraph you want to view. So we could set something up where one of the pages could have the embedded Excel spreadsheet. So since it's embedded, You can either update it in Excel or you can update it. There. Either way. Either way.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:37:27.656Z)

Interesting. Is it possible to do onenote? Like, I have one note, but it's for Hotel Bis. Can I separate it out? So it's just separate for an S. AI or does it have to be by Do I need to email and then say I email?

### You (2025-09-02T21:37:41.577Z)

No. So if you use onenote, You can have. You can subscribe to multiple onenotes. So I've got my personal One Node. I've got my other business One Note, and then I got Tycoon. So if you go on the left hand navigation up on top where it shows the name, your name. You can add other notebooks.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:38:07.096Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T21:38:07.817Z)

So you would just have to sign in to invest with your whatever username that you're using right now. I think your email right now will get you in.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:38:18.616Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T21:38:20.617Z)

So the rest of us, we could just log in with our InnVestAI. So you just need to choose whichever notebook you want.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:38:29.256Z)

Okay, I'll try that. Okay. Hi, diane. You're on mute. Thank you. Sorry I'm late. No worries. I was selling Vinod and Howard that I would like to start implement something that has been helpful for my existing company. Where we have an on our weekly calls, which we do just like 9am Monday morning or 10am Monday morning or something like that. We have a set agenda that we go over, like, same things every week. We have a file where we use track the progress of everything every week. And that way we can really just hone in on making sure that. We're not getting distracted by the million other things that need to get done but are not the most urgent priorities. And that we are also staying coordinated on what needs to get done. And know how we're going to know what the best way is to sort of. Do that from. If this is just Excel, obviously, but I want it to be something that we can easily people can access and add notes to if needed. But otherwise, this is something I'm happy to own in the short term. And then we can continue to update the process or modify the process as we go right now. We can add and adjust these items. This is sort of borrowed from my existing business. But operations being sort of the business aspect, business operations. Finance. Revenue expenses. It's receivable stables. Both of these kind of falling under you and me, Diane, to some extent. And then this being Mark Howard the node and been out, I honestly wasn't even totally sure what to put under. What are the detailed items to put under here? Yeah, I think that's kind of what Maybe this is something separate. Because I would like us to be closely tracking what we are. We Talked about the 13612 month product roadmap and the expenses associated with all of that that we would present to investors. And we did this three months ago. Right. But. We should be talking about that every week. We should be like, okay, where are we on this? And are we head of schedule? Behind schedule. Where are the obstacles? For any of these particular things. And so. I want to make sure that this is just a helpful way to keep us all aligned. Got it. And, Howard, you were saying do this in one note on our team site.

### You (2025-09-02T21:41:40.377Z)

It's a suggestion. Let me go ahead. I'm going to share my screen real quick.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:41:50.936Z)

Can I ask a question while you're doing that? It's just because I'm not used to modern tools. But is there not a way that slack? Or there's another, even with our Trello and our Atlantis and tools that we should be using one of those tools for something like this. I'm just curious. I think there are. I'm familiar with using one or. Excuse me, smartsheet. I think this is what Phil Howard is saying. OneNote can be the do this like that, okay?

### You (2025-09-02T21:42:34.137Z)

Yeah. So one note. We already have a OneNote tab. In the InnVestAI teams. So if we can keep everything in team so we don't have to log into different tools for there. So I'm logged into the OneNote desktop here, but it's exact same process if you're using the one on teams.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:42:48.056Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T21:42:58.857Z)

So, Drew, what I was telling you here is. Here are all the different onenote. That I'm subscribed to, right? So if I want to add a new note, I would just come in here. I forget where it is. On the home team or home teams. Oh, down here. Add a notebook, right? So I could click on this and I could navigate to whatever notebook is. Now, this is already connected to the InnVestAI on there, so I'VE been using this. To keep notes. On all of our team meetings. I haven't finished all of the August. I should probably keep this updated, but every. Every time we have a meeting and I use Granola to record it, I just copy it over here. But here's what I was mentioning before, so let me just add a new page.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:43:46.856Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T21:43:50.857Z)

And, you know, if we wanted to invent Excel here, all you need to do is go up to the file. And then I'm just gonna. Here on my desktop, it would be the same thing. You know, I could click in Excel, open it. And then I'm going to get this. Now, what we want to do is select the OneDrive, but since this is on my laptop, I could use this. But if it's on OneDrive and insert a link, this embeds it, so that way you can make changes to the Excel spreadsheet here. In OneNote. Or you can go to Excel and just open up the spreadsheet and whatever you put in one will be reflected in the other.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:44:32.216Z)

Okay, so on teams, is this something I get to from Do I have to put in that OneNote app into Teams?

### You (2025-09-02T21:44:40.697Z)

No. So let me switch screens here real quick. Or actually, I can just tell you. So if you're in teams. And you're in the InnVestAI channel the teams.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:44:58.376Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T21:44:59.257Z)

So on the top, you should see files, notes, InnVestAI whiteboard, everything else. Notes. Already hooked up to the one goat. So everything that I was just showing you here on my desktop is right here. So here's my external meetings, here's my team meetings. And you can see it does look a little bit different here. But if I go to the insert, and I'll insert a file and I can go in here, insert file attachment. It'll just take you through the whole process. Same thing. I prefer the desktop. You can do a lot more in the desktop than you can on here. But if you go in, if you use the desktop version, you can do what I showed you before. Just go and add a new notebook. And then navigate. To the team's site. And go here and you can find it.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:45:58.386Z)

Okay, if I should share this with myself from the teams, I can probably get it from my onedrive desktop.

### You (2025-09-02T21:45:58.457Z)

As long as you're logged in teams. Yes. You can do that as well.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:46:13.506Z)

Yeah, this is cool. I think this would work.

### You (2025-09-02T21:46:19.017Z)

Yeah, I've been using OneNote for years, kind of about where user on that one. And that's one of the things that I like about it. It's very much like Google. Right? If you've ever used a Google work.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:46:31.986Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T21:46:32.457Z)

Google workplace that super easy to connect one tool to another. You can embed it in there. And make changes in one and have it show up in the other real time. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:46:49.586Z)

Okay, cool. All right. Well, okay, that's good. I'll have to work on this and hopefully get it something set up for later this week.

### You (2025-09-02T21:47:04.297Z)

Yeah. If you need any help, just let me know.

### Guest (2025-09-02T21:47:07.186Z)

All right, cool. Dan. I know. I'll let you start because I know something you want to are going to be excited to share with Vinod and Howard. Yes, I am. I think we've secured our second investor. Which is Driftwood Capital. It's Howard. And I had a call with Manny, their cto. In July, and I have been. This is a really just funny story. That I love poor men in February of 2023. I can't believe it's so hard for me to say that right now because I think February of 2023. Right. And I reached out to Jared Kelso that March and asked him to introduce me to two people, Wanda Howard and two to Carlos Rodriguez Jr. Who is an active speaker about technology and how it'll impact total investments in the future. So he did that. And it was on the same day back in March. And obviously, Howard is a partner in our company now. And Carlos Jr. Is interested in investing in us, probably 70 to 75K. There is a little bit of a trade off that I proposed for him so that it would be more easily presentable to his dad. It's a family office. Which is that I will spend two days a week or half my time. Helping them with asset management, where they're currently understaffed. Through the end of March in return for a 70 to 75k investment and InnVestAI. And so kind of upfront, I'm going to need to draw on some of that to just literally, Mark's not on this call, so I'll just be as clear so that I can literally pay bills that I'm already behind on and feed my family. But getting Driftwood on board as a capital partner is huge. They represent the owner Persona. They also have. I didn't mention this. They also have a management company as well, so I think they can fill in for us on some beta testing. With management company stuff. Drew Raiden mentioned this earlier when we talked, but the whole concept of can a manager actually directly transfer data into InnVestAI versus having to drop files. That's not something we're going to be doing immediately, right? But when we get ready to beta test something like that, since their management company as well. They could really help us with things like that. They have an internal project called Domino, where they also are trying to digitize or use AI for their investor workflows. A lot along the lines of what we've talked about, tracking returns and things like that. So there is so much opportunity for, I think, a long term strategic relationship with Driftwood, where they invest in us. And we line up domino with where invest is, where they're farther along on certain things, perhaps like tracking returns and using Yardi and Yardi workaround s things like that. We may be able to advance our go to market strategies based on some things they're more advanced on than we are. But we're more advanced on the AVN piece than they are. So they may benefit from obviously InnVestAI. The caveat is most of their hotels are very complicated, even some resort hotels, they invest quite a lot in Florida with. They have a Space coast strategy. But that will help us. But Carlos really understands all of this, how you would first go after a data structured finance vertical and then an appraisal vertical. Right. And I think his team would be helpful when we get ready to build out a more complicated. The version of a more complicated AVM for full service hotels. Where we have a revenue module and a food and bevered module. So we left it that I owe him an investor deck. Which, by God, we're going to get done by Sunday end of day, if it kills me and Drew and Mark will then look at it and wordsmith it better than I run it through Drew's AI, his beautiful AI template that we've been using. And then I owe him a bit about the economics. Of how we see the company. Our cash needs to get through, like, six months and then to get through college. Do Series A, right? And what you're talking about, the roadmap and all of that. But I'm very encouraged by the conversation, and it's taken me years to build this relationship with him. Of all the customers that could possibly be out there for me, And what I know about what Driftwood is doing. They're the most advanced from a technology perspective and would be the best strategic partner for us because they don't care. I mean, their idea was let's build this for ourselves. And he says it's not let's build all of it. He jokes. Ronnie says it's like, how do you glue the strategy together, right? Build by partner. But I think he would very much like to be a capital source behind us long term so he could benefit. On the work they're doing internally at Driftwood. And it's not just a Driftwood strategy. Right. It becomes a market strategy. So I woke up this morning, the call was at 11. And it was a really nice thing to have happen on September 2 this year. I'm incredibly happy about it. And then at some point, we're going to need to have a call where we introduce him to all of us, he and Manny to all of us, so that our teams get to know each other better. Amazing. That's a great. Yeah. And dang. We could talk about this maybe a little bit more after this, but. There may be more that Hotel Bis can do in the short term. Because some of what you're talking about sounds more applicable to. Yeah, but anyways, let's talk about that afterwards. Yeah, that is very exciting. I'm going to go back here to. I was sharing. All right. So. Okay. Just to get to what? The things we're working on, right? So I'll skip ahead here to our customer and investor relations. Kind of speaking for Mark here. The pitch deck. Right, Diane, you're working on this right now, which will be very important or just kind of urgently needed for driftwood. I think related to that will be a one pager. And this is actually, I can't remember when it was or if we talked about this, that I wanted to try to put together an infographic like a one page because I think pictures speak louder than words in this case. That we can use and maybe put on our website or something like that, that sort of. That illustrates what we are, what we're trying to accomplish from a. Not just from a pain point. And user benefit perspective and also from a features and functionality perspective. And to help explain AI not using those. All those technical terms. But because I just think there's so much confusion about how it works from the business community. And so making it a little technical, but be more and people speak too in that infographic would be really helpful. And then, Diane, I've been keeping a list of groups that we've been talking about. Petrie being one of the top ones. Fulcrum, et cetera. Sasha, Group Rest, Western Lionsbank. And I put their food on it. Now, Prolorriz Jr. And again. I'll think about where to put this. But I think it'll be really, we should. Going forward? Because this is what I wanted to say to that for you. You mentioned the drip from Carlos Rodriguez News. Because that is exciting. But I think it's going forward. We should make sure we have our talking points aligned. Have our single pitch deck that we're using, have our one pager, have our list of groups that we're going to talk to and coordinate prior to talking to them. Because we want to make sure that we are saying all the right things. And Mark is going to have the most experience with this sort of thing and knowing not to offer evaluation. Right. That's one of the. We talked about that earlier. The three of us, right, but. We should be not ever giving ourselves evaluation. At this point if we can avoid it, because once we start to do that, then we immediately start to have that number attached to us that it's going to be really hard to get out of it. Andrew, I agree with that, but I really need to get caught up mentally and understand how. I mean, I get the concept of a safe note. But they get something. They get shares or something, right? Because at the. What I understand about a safe note. Is it converts to real equity at a Series A. Some point in the future. Right. Series A trigger. But some point in the future, it has to somehow mathematically become something in order to get. Yeah. In order for somebody like a true investor, like Series A or somebody. Right. To come in and become a true investor. Right. Like with equity investor, like any of us. They would have to come in and we would have to collectively decide that this company or individual is going to get 20% of the company. For $100,000. Or something like that, right? And that means that that 20% or 100,000 would mean that the company itself is worth 500,000. Right. That's like a screwed up my math there, but that would be how that mechanism works. Safe note. Is more like a loan. That individual where company is going to give us X amount of money. And when a value is determined. They get that amount of money worth of equity. Right. So if somebody were to give us future moment in time. Right. Have to be done. Let's just use series A for a trigger. When a series. When we get to the series A, we will have to do evaluation. And therefore. Then what? Retroactively, you go back and look at how much stock is assigned to the sale. There's no stop. It's just an amount of money. That's why I pick a loan. There's no stock. It's a loan. And so what is it then? The loan then? If It's a Sherbin's $50,000, right? And say that when we get to series A, r valuation is 10 million. Is this good? $5 million? Let's choose $5 million because it's 50k. Is it then that. His 5k is 50,000, then becomes a 1% equity. Right, so it's 50k is the nouminate, the numerator, and the denominator is the valuation at the series A trigger. Is that it? Correct. Okay. And there are other things that can go into it, right? There can be multipliers, there can be discounts. Usually there's like, if you're a safe note investor, you get more than just your amount divided by valuation, you get like a 20% bonus. Or something like that. So there's usually that gives you an advantage over being an early believer, so to speak. And then, of course, if things don't materialize, I had a safe note. Active data and. It was for, like, you know, if something happens in the next year, then they get like, 120% of the value of what they lend it they loaned me. Nothing happens, so I just pay them back. It was a loan. That's it. They did not opt into their equity. Like they just said. This is whatever. Just give us money. Back, and then it was at some predetermined interest rate. So there are all kinds of things that can go into it. But the important part of that, there's almost like a promote on it if it does convert to equity, and if it doesn't convert to equity, it's repaid with a market interest rate. Yeah. Because the important part about this is that it is really hard to agree on a value of something on the value of something as ambiguous as what we have right now. Right. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, whatever. We could just literally write down on a piece of paper and put it up. You're like, this is a 50 million dollar idea. And I'm sure people be like, sure, yeah. I'll buy in. But the group we are right now. I think. We could do that and get a lot of different people agreeing and disagreeing what that number is. And ultimately, it's probably not going to be a number that we like very much. So the more we can kick the can down the road on that, the better. Okay? Would you happen to? I mean, I can. I can find a safe note. Example. But would you share? You can take the numbers out, you can keep the numbers. I just want to see the mat. I just want to see how it's written, the legalese, like all of that, of what it looks like. Would you mind? Shooting me one. Yeah. Thank you. Benod Howard, did you have questions on this? No, it sounds good. And similar to why I was saying we should really keep the three of us. And Vinod and Howard, you as well. Right. If you have people you think would be interested in this at this point or later, but we should be really crafting our messaging and our wants and needs. Needs. To those individuals very carefully before we do it. We should talk about this later. When it comes to driftwood is like, I think perhaps an alternative way to do this, rather than you working for free, might be that if Hotel Bis, if you can get a driftwood to become a hotel EIS customer for their immediate needs, Hotel BIS can pay you. And then we all make. And then that can similarly see data into InnVestAI. Okay, so, yeah, I'm open to that idea too. And we're going to talk about this one on one, so we'll block time. But I do want to kind of make one distinction, and that is you own Operational Asset Management. Right. I don't think any of us even really want to touch that. You are the pro. Hotel bills does that. When it comes to. Down the line to okay, now we need to start tracking returns and IRRs just making sense. This, I feel like, kind of falls more into the invest AI piece. Does that make sense? Because this then hopefully will connect to Juniper Square. And that's how Invest AI gets the end to end connectivity. So I just wanted to mention. I mean, we'll have to figure that out. But they're both asset management functions. It's just one is more of like that investor side, you know what I'm saying? Well, I think we talked about it previously. You, I think, did. This. You would said this. Yes, yes. Portfolio like asset, property, this part of it versus the investment part of it. Right, Right. And there's obviously overlap, but Hotel Bis does is much more in this realm. And I think. And what InnVestAI is talking about is much more in this. Like, it's sort of like one or two steps up. And June per square being more like up here, I think. Right. And I'll say one last thing about this and then I really will end it's just so that it's in your mind. They are very frustrated with actable because they feel like they pay actable way too much to give them their data and then have actable just return their data in the way it's returned. So they've always been frustrated with actable, but they feel equally that they need that light. So many light, so many lighthouse, right? They use lighthouse. And they need that lighthouse data. Really integrated into their operational data and their investment data, their investment modules as well. So I just wanted to mention that to you. Okay. It's very good to know. So we'll talk about more about that. But this is just so to just close the loop on this point when it comes to approaching our investors. Potential investors, potential customers. Before you have more calls. Like you did with Carlos. Circle up with us first so we make sure. We have the very specific talking points down as to what we presenting ourselves as well as what we want in return. And that'll come back to the budget. Piece that we'll get you and how are the road and all of us are working on. And then hopefully we have by the end of the week or next week some clear. And I put this here. 1, 3, 6 months, 12 months. Right. Like budget forecast. To keep track of. Yes, Andrew, I'm sorry. Just going back to this one more time, which is if I miss stuffed with Carlo's apologies. It's just that I've spent two years trying desperately to. Like, I have worked so hard to build that relationship. I can't even explain to you, like, how many free calls. I took or, like, things that I've done to get where I am with Carlos. You understand, right? Yeah, I. Believe me. I've been in the same boat and. Now I have business partners for two years, but I'm still learning to work collabor atively with them versus doing things unilaterally. It is something we all forever work on because you draw the line. Well, I don't want to ask. You don't need to coordinate everything. Right. It's hard to know where to draw that line. And having these weekly calls and bringing things up. Is hopefully will make sure that we are better. Got it. And then the second thing, and I just. I really cannot. If there's someone recording this, record this and put it in giant capex or giant. Capital bold letters is once we get this pitch deck done. And it is my highest priority, along with some mathematical estimate of like shares and understanding the economic side of what our valuation could be based on certain revenue hurdles and profit hurdles. Right? And please, I cannot express this enough. It's time. We have to go start to get these five, six, seven, eight friends and family, this capital in place because people on this call will not financially survive. Six months with no pay. And it's just, we can't be like, okay, it's great we have the pitch deck, but we're still not ready to talk to so and so and so and so. Because it's like, it's just, we have to get vinod on this full time. The next investor that comes in. That capital probably needs to be focused on getting the node away to quit his job and join us full time. We're going to start incurring small costs, albeit costs nonetheless. And Howard and I need. We have to have something, or we're going to. I agree. The two individuals, right. Like investors you already got. I think is fantastic. So just to be clear, though, in the pitch deck, we're not talking about valuation. There is no valuation or revenue projections. Oh no, there do need to be revit though. I mean I have gone studying this for a series a for later on. No, you need to do tam and you need to do ARR or hardwood. Did you say som or something like that? Right. There's a term like.

### You (2025-09-02T22:10:08.377Z)

Yeah. There's your tan. And then your subject, which is what you think you can get or potential. And then I have to go back and look, I forgot what they start with. And then the ones that you think you can really get, right?

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:10:26.466Z)

Yeah. And.

### You (2025-09-02T22:10:30.857Z)

So yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:10:32.386Z)

And you don't need a specific business plan to say we're going to get this. You're just trying to show what the potential is. But even a friend's and family pitch deck needs to have one slide at a high level. That talks about yeah, I can talk about Pam and Market, but we should not try to talk about like, we shouldn't give. A 612 month. We don't even have pricing yet, so it's very difficult to talk about ar, right? But I think you do. Drew, I'm not trying to be difficult. I spent weeks researching what a pitch deck needed to include. And I went through countless examples from different sources. And there is one slide as well that says you need to have some milestones. For example, Chelsea from their capital said you guys really should try to target being at around 500k in ARR before you can start to talk to a group like fair right? So what it's ever all the research I'VE done that's recommended is that within a year you try to get. You're literally just putting a number on paper. But you say 500k. ARR. I agree. Yeah, okay. However, when we have 500 in ARR, we can put together a deck that goes to fair and says we have 500. In ARR. And here's what we think we're going to have in the next six, 12 and 18 months. Until we have that, though. Going to. Your husband's friend. Really good friend. Right. I'm guessing is doesn't necessarily need evaluation. But, Carlos, if we get. If we say we're going to have three months from now, we're going to have 100. And then six months we'll have 250 in. In a year we'll have 500 in. ARR. Then that's going to become a budget. We're going to become beholden to that, and it's going to be. He's going to say, okay, well, I'll put a two times multiple on that for now, or three times multiple and it's going to become a valuation. So does that make sense? But, no, I do understand what you're saying, that that can easily be, for some people, a budget. But again, everything I researched said that this is like a fundamental slide that you need. I know, but just speaking of somebody who went through it. Going through it, who's been in it for five years now. There will be a point, hopefully very soon, that that makes sense. But at this point, we don't want it. That is, puts us at a disadvantage. If we can help it. Right. And Mark is going to say the same thing. He has already said the same thing. We absolutely talking about market size? Makes a lot of sense. Talking about revenue projections for ourselves in the next 3, 612 months. That becomes a valuation. And is going, but it's more like 12 months. It's more like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years. Right. But then we're, like, ahead. Again because I know you believe and I agree. We could be at a hundred million dollars in ARR in five years. There's no way. That's like a moonshot. What I've been advised is you don't actually put 100. You just try to get your ARR to run, like 30 mil. And so you start like 500k the first year, then you bump it up. It's kind of a bullshit. Slide, but everything I've read said it needs to be included. But, look, I'll take it out. If you guys want to take it out. You can leave it in for now. But I think when we talk about it, I suspect Mark is going to stay the same, but that's something we should include. Later. Not in the immediate. Hitch tag, right? Because it's like what I've said before. Trying to not focus about features and functionality. We're selling a dream and a vision. And that doesn't necessarily need any numbers, per se. It's all very much like. There's a lot of gray area in all this. It's a fine line between. Selling the vision and including the TAM and talking about what that means from a revenue and therefore value perspective. But the more we can lean towards just sticking towards the vision and the roadmap. And the immediate amount of money that we need to get from A to C. And then when we get to see, then we can say, like, look, we've got quarter million or a million in ARR, and based on our pipeline and expected customers, And the activity we genuinely like. We have some proof to say that we can get to a million in the next six months. With this amount of money. It gives us more because there's just not enough. There's not enough there there to do that right now. The other thing I've read quite a lot about is that another way to value a startup. Is you take what you need in capital from a precede perspective and let's say for us that's three to four million dollars, which was, I mean that is completely feasible that we would need 3 to 4 million dollars if thing goes, if this goes 24 to 36 months and that it's highly advisable that we break that precede down into, like. We don't go ask for $4 million. We start with 500k and then, you know, we do a bigger one. But I have read over and over and over again that that $4 million typically represents 10 to 15% of the value of the company when you get to Series A. So if you've spent $4 million and we go out for Series A and I'm just going to use 10%, that would probably put our valuation at about 40 million. So that's a mathematical thing that I can't tell you how many articles I've read that say that's a way people look at when there's nothing else because we have no customers. Right. But that is just a way that I want everyone to understand. Because I've read it enough now that I feel like it's a valid kind of tech thing and how people look at numbers and valuations. Yeah. And I've read a lot of the same, and I think there is. I mean, obviously there is truth to that. It's just a matter of. Does that apply to us? At this time. It will apply to us at a certain point, but in this moment. But we're going to need to put out there what we need for precede. To get to precede, right? And it is probably going to be 3 to 4 million dollars when it's all said and done. I'll lay it out so you guys can see it, because I've done probably 50% of the math at this point. But if you've read the same thing, then I just want to say that anyone who's really fluent in something like this may just be like, oh, $4 million represents 10 to 15% of the value. And they may, in their mind, make that like a cap rate analysis. It's as simple as a cap rate analysis. It's a multiple one arrow. It's usually a multiple on error, but again, we have to get there first. So meeting 4 million to get to. We're not at the point where. It's got to be baby steps. And I think what you've done already, like, with these two investors. Those are huge steps forward. And we'll get when we have the pitch deck. And it sounds like a little bit more from an MVP product perspective, we can go teach. Tree is the other one we wanted to talk about. And I think having Driftwood on board, going to Peachtree, Dan Leslie, Dan Lesfer and say, go. Driftwood is involved. I pray to God that unless her just says, that's awesome, let me write a check for 75k exactly. For me. How? To start with capital. As a customer, people are like, oh, well, then you're clearly not full of shit, right? Not completely anyway. So you got to kind of play all these things off of one another. But not like I said. We've talked probably more about this than we need to at this point. Sorry. Again. I hear what you're saying. I agree. It's just a matter of finding the right, taking it one step at a time. Right. And when we get that investor pitch deck done, we need to be careful not to drag our feet, because for whatever reason, we feel like. I mean, because this team will not financially survive. Six months. Okay. Yeah, I completely, completely, completely agree and understand. Yes. All right, so I'm going to put this to my name here for now. As far as the operating agreement. I'm reading that bank account. This is sort of all on. I think these are me as well, but subsequent to the operating agreement being completed, And I'm going to put Rent Li here as well. Diane, I think you're working on this, right? Okay? As far as expenses and. I don't really watch as far as revenues and expenses. But Vinod, how are we talking about this earlier? I want to keep. Well, it's actually back. How are you saying you have a few things on your cards, Credit cards that your expenses. Right, Diane? I'm guessing you do as well. Maybe we should. I think we should try to move those to one card. I'm happy for it to be. I have one card that I was just going to use for this. I think Vinod, have you been able to get that card, that first card I gave you to work for most items or is it not working from aws? So I think it is good. Okay? It was just, like, one thing it wasn't working for, right? Okay, then let's try to get all of it on one card. So, power Van, if you want to tell me what those Just in an email, right, we can just list what those things are and we'll start to try to get it all onto one credit card so we can easily track it. I think that will be beneficial as far as just making sure we know what we're spending. And what about on this very small future things? It would be a very good idea for us to lock down our GoDaddy domain past the year I initially set. Vinod brought that up a couple of weeks ago, which is a great idea. I just on flat broke, so I can't do that right now. Put it on this. Okay. Yeah. Where am I going to put that? Here. And I think Howard needed a subscription to a no code tool. Right. However that you were talking about, that was like, $70 a month.

### You (2025-09-02T22:23:05.737Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I had the bills onto the to the spreadsheets as well. One would be 100, the other one would be 25.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:23:12.466Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-02T22:23:15.977Z)

But that would be if we just did a monthly. Each of those offers pretty decent discount on an annual, but I think the one that's $100 is the lovable tool that I've been using. And things change so fast in there. I almost hate to be locked into one year because I probably have projects on five different tools right now. It's like, oh, yeah, this one's great. Oh, wait, that one just introduced back and forth. The one that's 2599. Drops to 1999 for a year. And that one I think we would probably continue to use almost indefinitely. So that one, I think we should probably should pay for a year.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:24:06.786Z)

Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I would say let's just keep everything month to month right now.

### You (2025-09-02T22:24:14.697Z)

Okay? That makes sense.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:24:16.226Z)

And every month.

### You (2025-09-02T22:24:17.017Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:24:18.306Z)

Every month we can reevaluate. All our tech tools on month to month right now. Cursor, copilot. Yeah, I would rather spend an extra. I'm an annualized basis. I'd rather spend an extra $100 in total in order to save $75 today. Because we have very little cash.

### You (2025-09-02T22:24:43.337Z)

That's a good point. I'm assuming that these credit cards are probably yours or Mark's personal credit cards, Right? So I think as soon as we get a bank account, we'll have our own credit cards that we can use.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:24:53.906Z)

Yeah, or we will just pay. It'll probably just.

### You (2025-09-02T22:24:57.177Z)

We'll have an InnVestAI. Corporate card.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:24:59.906Z)

But again, even when there's. Let's say there's $10,000 in the InnVestAI bank account, I'd rather spend getting. What is that? One of those subscriptions? Lovable was $100 a month.

### You (2025-09-02T22:25:12.537Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:25:13.186Z)

So it's $84 a month if we do it all at once. But that's like almost $1,000 now versus $100 every month now.

### You (2025-09-02T22:25:21.977Z)

Right. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. I'll just make sure everything's month to month.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:25:22.706Z)

It's like, from a cash perspective. Yeah, we just reevaluate every month.

### You (2025-09-02T22:25:29.897Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:25:37.186Z)

Okay? Now, to get down to this part, which I don't have exactly what the best way to speak to these was or is. Drew, if you could share that. She will keep it updated. And next meeting you can discuss. Yeah. I'll put it on the. I think one note. I'll try to figure how to put it on onenote in such a way that we can keep. Maybe right now, this is all qualitative feedback.

### You (2025-09-02T22:26:08.857Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:26:09.426Z)

I do have couple of items to discuss before we run out of the time, so please.

### You (2025-09-02T22:26:13.657Z)

Well, those three product items would be my responsibility.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:26:21.026Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T22:26:21.897Z)

Testing. There's going to be my testing that I would do to confirm that something's ready to go. But Vinod is also going to be doing some testing. So we'll each have something like that to go on. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:26:37.906Z)

Okay? And somehow. Maybe it's in a column. Talk about the different features that we've talked about. That. Are in development. I don't know what the best way is to lay those out. I know from an AI perspective there were four or five. One being pulling data from the PNLs no end, doing market research, doing a deal summary. And I can't remember what the other one was. Right, but those are three. Ideally, I'd love to somehow lay out the product features. That we are working against so that the two of you can articulate. The progress on each one and let us know if they're what's close. What we can do to review and test where you guys need help or input. I know. Power do you need? There's a lot of backlog on the documentation that I need to review. Right. So just, like, if it's all clearly laid out, then we can really easily see what each of us with outstanding and what's done and all that. That makes sense. All right. Howard, do you want to speak to any of these or anything else now from a product perspective?

### You (2025-09-02T22:28:00.857Z)

No, the documentation, I think were good. I think we can finalize the formulas. And then also I just would like yourself in the node to kind of take a look at that high level AI. And Diane, I'm thought I sent it to you as well, but the AIPRD as well. Just want to make sure nobody has any questions on that or that I didn't miss anything. And then testing the note, I was going to ask you, are we good on staging yet? Are we still having some technical issues? I'm waiting for you to tell me that I can do some testing. In the staging environment.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:28:44.066Z)

Yes, tracing is good. Earlier we are having the login issues there. So that is resolved. I believe there's still some issue with the database connectivity that I am actually working on. I'll keep it posted on that.

### You (2025-09-02T22:28:56.617Z)

Okay? Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:29:07.746Z)

Anything else. To list here for now.

### You (2025-09-02T22:29:10.937Z)

Roadmap. Yeah, I think we want to keep the roadmap on everybody's radar.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:29:12.706Z)

Or roadmap. Absolutely.

### You (2025-09-02T22:29:19.497Z)

So for that one, Vinod and I did meet last week. We kind of went over the four grid roadmap for the next six to 12 months. And I'm currently putting that in a PowerPoint. Format. So that you guys can pick and choose how you want to present that in a deck, if at all. I'm pretty. What I'm putting together is pretty detailed, so you probably will want to aggregate certain things or just pick out highlights. But I'll have that ready probably by the end of the day tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:29:57.746Z)

Okay? I think what we put in this from a pitch deck marketing perspective, Will be super high level. And what marketing Diane and I have been talking about is trying. To only refer to features and functionality as it pertains to addressing customers and investors, fears and hopes.

### You (2025-09-02T22:30:21.897Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:30:22.146Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-02T22:30:22.377Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:30:24.146Z)

So your high level. But internally, I think having more detail will be really helpful so we can clearly track the roadmap against the expenses. And progress where we.

### You (2025-09-02T22:30:33.737Z)

Yeah. So right now we've got, you know, the POC has done. For all intents and purposes, they're working on the mvp, expecting that mid to late September, and then we'll need 30 to 6, 60 to 90 days of testing of the MVP. But in the meantime, they'll start working on version one. Then we would hope that we could get version one out in the December, January. Time period, and then same thing each time we have a major version. The next one will be looking at the next quarter. So version 1.1 that I had in there would be probably March and beyond. But again, I also put something in here. You know, if you're not familiar with the term CI cd, it's continuous improvement, continuous development. So I don't want anybody to convey.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:31:26.866Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-02T22:31:29.417Z)

The thought that we're only going to be releasing something every 90 days. I'll talk in quarters for very general but then we will be releasing. I mean, it could be two a week. It could be every two weeks if we're working on something large. That's really kind of what I'm trying to put into PowerPoint just to get that.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:31:46.866Z)

Yeah. Howard doing something else, too. I think that's really important that I want to mention. We talked about it this morning. We've been thinking about. Or I asked him to think about what customer objections could be. When we pitch a customer that might say, well, why do I need InnVestAI I can use AI to do my. I've already figured out how to use Claude to advance my modeling, right? Or I don't see. I have lots of data and I have this great analyst and this wonderful bi tool or something. And so I'm thinking about that with the pitch deck. But, Howard, you said you were going to work on the Personas, right? As well, and almost go through an exercise like that where you try to think about or use AI to help think about what their objections could be so we can plan how to overcome.

### You (2025-09-02T22:32:49.257Z)

Yeah, I've been using AI for that for a couple of years now. I mean, that was one of the earliest things that when it came out, that it proved to be extremely useful, is to play the devil's advocate. And you kind of put in as much detail as you can about what you're doing, what the feature includes. Who are the users? And then you just basically say, what are the points of failure? What are the objections? And it'll give you very detailed responses that you can prepare for. And then what I'd mention to Diane is I've also got a program that I'm using right now to basically do the same thing at the Persona level. So what I did is I created a cloud project. I've uploaded every prd, every document that's related to the development. The Persona document included the AI features, everything that we're doing there. And I'm going through Persona one at a time. So I say, okay, let's take our lender Persona. And the first thing I said, given all this information, what are the top five features that this Persona will use? It'll list out the five features, and I'll say the opposite. What are the three features? That they won't use. And they'll give me that. And then the last thing I ask is what are we missing? Is there any feature that we overlooked and need to include in it will come up with some pretty decent list. A lot of them are definitely not things that we can do. Technologically or time wise? A lot of them were. Yeah, it would be great if you can integrate with the appraisal tools. And it listed the tools. I don't remember what they are, but, I mean, it came up with the actual tools. So that's why I mentioned I think if Diane or anybody, any of us could go through and just do that type of analysis, that would be very helpful.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:34:58.866Z)

Interesting. And kind of speaking of that same way of using AI, I'm going to go through the LLC agreement with, like, 15 very practical questions, real world questions. Of what would happen if we fail or a member wants to step out from a day to day perspective or someone goes bankrupt or someone dies or I'm going to try to think of 15 real world things that could happen to us. But I do want to ask if you guys have any thoughts about things you would want to see in that list, because I think that's how we finally check that the LLC is equivalent is when we run a handful or two handfuls of real world problems that we could face where we would need to look to the LLC for guidance and if we can figure out front if the guidance exists based on the draft. I think that will help us get to a finalized llc. So if you have thoughts about real world problems that could we would have to figure out as a team, please shoot them to me so I can be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible on that. All right. Vinod anything from a technology perspective. From our last meeting. I don't think there's a lot changed. So I was kind of busy doing some personal work. One of the engineer had some laptop issues. So you didn't do much as well. And then Shar equals having different issues. So I asked him to take a break for now and we might bring him on board later on. Once we are better organized. But yeah, I think we'll make him a one month payment one time. And then we'll kind of onboard the new engineer, which I shared in the morning. How do you like that guy? Shared the link, then I don't know whether you have. Yes. Yeah, he looked great. Yeah, I think he is very diverse experience. He can help us out with infrastructure as well as with the application development. That is great. He's currently with tcs. He has worked with AWS and other companies as well. So that's good. But he's not available full time. He'll be probably helping us out. Yeah. Four hours every day. Do you think he will be a better fit? As far as alleviating some of the what we talked about last week. Your limitations on time and availability to get into the minutiae. Do you think he'll be more able to pick up things and go with them on his own? Definitely yes. Is more senior, so he can help me out with day to day task and kind of other things. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, I'll update that technology list, but for now, we are still kind of mapping the extracted data into the application. And implementing the logic, the formulas at the application level. Anything you need from us. For that. More pnl, more oms or anything. No, I think, yeah, you have already provided enough documents, so that is good. The only thing. I would need is what's going on with our account. Are we? I'll have to make a payment to Sharik. I think on 6th or something he completes his one month. So there is just one time. $400 we'll have to pay because he kind of worked for a month now. Yeah. I send you money? That was your last month's, though, so he's coming up on two months. Think. This guy Sharik, right, who is going out. He joined on August. Sixth. I think. Close to a month. He also paid for his cursor subscription because the card was not going through. The ask him to pay from his account. She was the third one that came on, right? Yeah. He was the third one, Yeah. Okay, then I'll send my or however I send you money last time, Venmo. I think I'll send you another. 400 for that. Thing. We'll just continue with the monthly payment. For what? From whatever date. We paid last time. I'll see what date you when mowed me. I think it was 19, I believe. I mean, it's possible. Where then we'll have to bank account. Once we can have an operating agreement to send to the bank, then it should just be like a day or two to just bet of the bank account. That is that. So I'll update the technology list row. If you could reshare that sheet, keep that updated. The couple of things. Anything more in that? Let's draw. We are good. I do have few items beside that list. Now. Go for it. Yes, one is. Diane had asked for six month roadmap in a last call. Right. I think Howard prepared something. Probably finalizing something. So probably Howard will share that. Soon.

### You (2025-09-02T22:41:07.657Z)

Yeah, that's what I was mentioning earlier about.

### Guest (2025-09-02T22:41:11.506Z)

Thing you said you'd have probably this week. You'd have, like, a roadmap, right?

### You (2025-09-02T22:41:14.777Z)

Yeah, same thing.

Are you guys waiting on me for writing LLC signature or anything like that? Or. Good there. Just to make sure you've read it, especially the parts about your wife. And maybe you could just run the I'll see through AI and ask your question s making sure your wife can sign what any personal questions you might have to make sure that it's addressed and I'll see. Sounds good. And then I also briefly wanted to show you this wait list thing. I don't think there's anyone working in our list. So that's why you're kind of. Not getting that email. So do you see my screen? Yeah. Let me see. It's empty. And just to show you it works, I'll quickly fill it and test. So I'll just fill that form and I will go back here. And reload that. So this is the form that I just filled. That functionality is working, but, yeah, there's no one in the waiting list right now. Nice, okay? That's on the web page. That's on the web page. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's all from my side. And how would. I'll keep you posted on this staging environment. All right. Drew, thank you for doing the tracking on this. Yeah, and I'll get one note set up. I will figure out the best. I still want to put some more thought into how this is organized so we can clearly. Make sure we're touching on all the points that we need to touch on each week. All right.
