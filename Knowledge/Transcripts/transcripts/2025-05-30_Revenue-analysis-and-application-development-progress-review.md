### You (2025-05-30T19:01:07.457Z)

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:01:07.608Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:02:36.528Z)

Okay. First thing is that registration thing. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:02:40.887Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Any any word on that?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:02:44.858Z)

No. I haven't returned the email to you, my haven't gone in touch. I'll probably do it over the weekend. But does that

### You (2025-05-30T19:02:53.807Z)

See, if my name cannot go there, I I want

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:02:53.918Z)

see, because if my name cannot quote there, I I don't want

### You (2025-05-30T19:02:58.347Z)

to be like, yeah, this

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:02:58.958Z)

to be like, yeah, let's register

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:00.167Z)

register online thing now. And then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:01.368Z)

on Diane's name now. And then in the future, we'll see. We'll write your name later. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:03.277Z)

future with serial, right, you know, data. Right? And then data might

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:06.338Z)

And then later might never come.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:07.107Z)

name come.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:09.508Z)

Or

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:10.107Z)

Yeah. Changes with that. Yeah. No. I I understand. But

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:10.658Z)

time we change it to that.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:14.407Z)

I think we could put something in writing.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:15.648Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:17.497Z)

And and make it a a definite that when it's registered and when we get funded, then we could do something. But, yeah, I I don't blame you for feeling that way.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:31.288Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:32.077Z)

Yeah. But yeah. I I don't mean, I don't think Diane or Mark or Drew or anybody else's would do something like that, but

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:44.868Z)

Yeah. I mean, initially initially, that's all.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:44.877Z)

yeah, we just wanna

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:49.538Z)

If you remember, at Radix. Right? What was that guy's name? CIO's name? Sean. Sean.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:55.357Z)

showing from Sean.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:56.998Z)

Sean.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:57.347Z)

Oh, Shawn. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:03:57.998Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:03:59.747Z)

He's like he's even have to have

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:00.128Z)

He's like, he's he was everywhere. We know. We know. We know. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:02.847Z)

we're not allowed in all. Right? And then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:05.198Z)

And then he didn't even blink to fire me as soon as he got his VP.

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:06.647Z)

to find me as soon as you got in

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:09.648Z)

After he got his BP, he's like, okay. You are no more required now.

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:14.687Z)

Yeah. So, I mean, that's how people change. Right? Oh, they do. So right now, it's you

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:16.418Z)

So, I mean, that's how people change. Right? So right now, it's you and me who is

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:21.777Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:22.348Z)

like,

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:22.647Z)

forty five days, you might be out.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:23.258Z)

our day in and day out. And, you know, we are kind of

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:25.727Z)

You know, we have kind of very much required

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:27.778Z)

very much required

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:28.657Z)

But once people get

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:29.268Z)

But once people get funding their money, they can hire anyone.

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:30.137Z)

funding, they have money. Anyone. And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:33.288Z)

Then they might not need us. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:33.307Z)

they might not be us. Right? Yeah. That's that that's true. I guess we can we can talk about ways of you know, how we can do that. So yeah, let's let's see what the attorney says, see what options there are.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:04:48.638Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:04:50.267Z)

How it could be restructured. I mean, it seems to me like we could have almost like an employment contract.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:00.108Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:00.377Z)

But I don't know I guess my biggest concern is some type of a contract or something in writing while you're still employed with this other company. Would that be a violation of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:13.878Z)

No.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:14.667Z)

you know, I I guess I those are the only things that I would be concerned about. The best way I can understand is that your wife may have

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:21.658Z)

Best way that I can only send your wife name wife's name goes on the paper.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:24.717Z)

wife's name. Open up the paper. Yeah. And then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:26.908Z)

And then the company does a visa for you, which will cost 6,000 something, which I can pay. Company doesn't need to pay. I'll pay their cost.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:35.817Z)

Sure. And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:37.138Z)

And and then on paper, I'll be

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:42.867Z)

as a part time.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:43.258Z)

as a part time.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:44.317Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:44.578Z)

Which is legal. So you're gonna have two h and b, one doing full time. Another one, you are saying you are working part time.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:45.157Z)

Which is. So you can have two.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:51.728Z)

And that way,

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:51.937Z)

And that would

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:05:55.988Z)

it can work out.

### You (2025-05-30T19:05:56.567Z)

So I was thinking the other day is your wife employed?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:01.838Z)

She's not employed, but stays on edge for EAD.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:02.017Z)

She's not employed. But speaking of an Well, the only reason I asked is because of benefits and insurance. Typically, with a start up, when you have so few people,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:17.368Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:18.527Z)

typically wouldn't have insurance and four zero one k and everything else. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:22.498Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:25.357Z)

that was a concern too. I I didn't know if you could get coverage through your wife's employer, but obviously, if she's not working, then I don't I don't know what you would be able to do in that situation. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:37.788Z)

Yeah. I bought my insurance from marketplace.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:37.947Z)

I bought my service from, like, a place. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:40.918Z)

Which is very expensive, but that's what it is.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:43.727Z)

That's what I told you. It is.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:06:45.228Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:06:45.667Z)

So I I don't know You you do have to legally provide when you get to a certain number of employees, but I don't know what that is. So I'll we'll have to look into that as well. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:05.548Z)

Best way would be probably just jot down our question, get down, you know, rather

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:05.767Z)

Just short. Question get that. Get that point when we

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:10.518Z)

get appointment with the Tommy and yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:11.177Z)

the economy.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:13.938Z)

Get done with that. But, anyway, in the meantime, I'll ask this immigration attorney guy

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:20.277Z)

Yeah. Okay. Cool.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:20.848Z)

Let's see what he says.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:24.917Z)

So I don't know if you had a chance to take a look at

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:27.468Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:29.467Z)

most recent changes that I made. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:32.828Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I didn't. I didn't. Sorry. Yesterday, I dialed, like, dead. And today, it's been kinda working day. So

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:40.567Z)

Kind of work. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:42.658Z)

I was planning to have a look at that today.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:44.587Z)

Today. Yeah. No. Take your time. It's basically, I did my best to replicate what Drew had

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:50.428Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:53.507Z)

on that script that he put over where he went horizontally with the data.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:07:55.308Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-05-30T19:07:59.637Z)

I think it I think it turned out pretty nice. The only comment that I've had is from Diane where she wants she recommended that I put the ADR where the RevPAR is above it So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:08:13.018Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:08:13.507Z)

I can do that with one prompt. So we'll see. I'll go ahead and make that change and and yeah, just yeah, take a look at it. Just to kinda get

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:08:24.188Z)

Do do you wanna go over it right now, or do you want me to have a look?

### You (2025-05-30T19:08:25.967Z)

I could. Yeah. I did pull it up. Let me share my screen.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:08:28.828Z)

Sam? Sure. Sure.

### You (2025-05-30T19:08:31.217Z)

Screen. Sure. Alright. So do you see it right now? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:08:46.098Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:08:46.877Z)

Yeah. Alright. So, yeah, previously, this revenue analysis, some of this was going across, but the occupancy was on a page over here. This page

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:09:00.328Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:09:01.057Z)

let me go to this page first. So so this is the one where we I had originally the years going down vertically. Which was similar to something in I think I don't know if it was Mark's spreadsheet or what. And everybody thought that would be easier to work with horizontally. And I agree. This you know, if I'm in Excel, this is the way I would lay it out. So we've got the market analysis, comp set analysis, and then you can do the subject property down below.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:09:34.958Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:09:35.657Z)

Yeah. And this is where I had those toggles where I can do the direct input you know, over here. So I guess, you know, if you keep a keep an eye on the dotted line up above. So if I

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:09:45.458Z)

Mhmm. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:09:46.377Z)

increase the occupancy, you can see it all you know, it'll go up there. Everything will be changed, so it's dynamic there. Or I could just do the growth rate where you know, I could just do, you know, change it here as well. Yeah. So so that's basically where I

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:10:04.148Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:10:07.437Z)

went with the occupancy And then on the revenue then, I I brought that information over here. Now I do need to tie this. I don't have this occupancy tied to my forecast. The subject occupancy, which which you know, I think in the final version, we'll want to do But this now is getting us way closer to well, it does calculate the rooms revenue, And then I would probably consider continuing on this page and having the f and b or whatever. I think we scroll down, or create a separate f and b page or another page that's basically for other operated You know, we can we can we can talk about you know, there's one thing I thought about is on the property details. You know, we could have, like, a checkbox here that says, yes. I have a restaurant. I have a banquet room. I have a spa. I don't have the Right? And whatever they check here, could potentially flow into both the revenue and the expenses. Right? So I think we need to have a discussion on that with the group to see how we wanna do we do have it all on one page, there'd be an awful lot of verb a lot awful lot of scrolling going on here. But yeah. Not a big deal.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:11:28.378Z)

Yeah. And probably we could also do something like tab on the tab or some tab tabs on the top so we can, you know,

### You (2025-05-30T19:11:37.147Z)

And and remember, we're we're still gonna have little KPI cards

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:11:37.448Z)

click on. Each

### You (2025-05-30T19:11:41.217Z)

up on top or know, something where this is

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:11:44.998Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:11:45.667Z)

you know, frozen up above. So you can always see those KPI cards. So if we did that, then scrolling down here and making changes wouldn't be horrible. Yeah. Let's there again, we can do whatever we want. And when we get in front of the clients, you know, they may think it sucks or they may like it. I don't know. You know, that's that's where we're gonna get the fee or make the final decision based on that.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:12:12.718Z)

Yeah. This is revenue analysis. So this is all what do call?

### You (2025-05-30T19:12:22.587Z)

Call?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:12:23.958Z)

The historical data. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:12:27.257Z)

Well, it it is historical data.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:12:28.288Z)

Except the

### You (2025-05-30T19:12:31.387Z)

Here. And then you've got your year one through five. So, yeah, this is where you could input your occupancy projections You know, if it's a seven year, it could go through 20, 31. Know, be that that would be dynamic based on the number of or your hold period I had it in the different one, but we could have the whole period. You know, in maybe the pipeline. I mean, we'll we'll we'll talk about that, where we can put all of that information, and then whatever you input there is where

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:06.598Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:08.587Z)

we would get the subject property.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:12.138Z)

Yeah. Why I asked that? Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:24.077Z)

Okay. I'm back. Right. I'm sorry. You were saying?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:34.728Z)

No. Why I asked that question?

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:35.347Z)

What? I had a question.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:37.748Z)

Because if you remember, we were creating that new new deal flow. Right? And then we had that several steps there.

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:44.707Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:46.738Z)

So how is that fitting into this screen? Like, which information is coming to this one?

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:53.167Z)

This one. Like, rule See?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:55.148Z)

Like, say, rooms and keys,

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:56.567Z)

Most of what you have been saying.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:13:57.678Z)

most probably gonna be same. Then occupied room, that's

### You (2025-05-30T19:13:58.197Z)

Then how talk them somewhere.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:01.778Z)

gonna come from somewhere because user is gonna input that. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:02.477Z)

Yeah. Occupied rooms is is based on your occupancy down here. So you know, the occupied room, basically, the the number of rooms

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:13.868Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:15.607Z)

times the occupancy and annualized. So you know, that would be done through here for your for your occupancy. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:26.568Z)

Got you. So

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:27.567Z)

Yeah. So So so if I if I change this from seventy eight to 80, then that twenty nine five fifty six or jumps up to thirty one five. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:36.338Z)

Yeah. Cool.

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:37.857Z)

that's that will immediately change

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:40.198Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:40.667Z)

know, the numbers up there. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:14:44.748Z)

And then year on year growth, we're not gonna forecast that.

### You (2025-05-30T19:14:48.637Z)

That's not a forecast. That's a calculated field. So it's saying in 2021, we were 72.5%. In 2022, it went up to seventy four point two. And that's a 2.3% increase. So very simple math. It's current year minus previous year

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:09.748Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:11.007Z)

divided by the previous year to get your growth rate. K? You got a chance. You got a chance.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:18.108Z)

Gotcha. Got you.

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:21.407Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:21.858Z)

And then that comp set

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:22.827Z)

that come

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:25.758Z)

Okay. One second. Okay? So let's year on year, we are just not gonna predict whatever is in the and then comp set as trend report

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:34.557Z)

Yeah. That also

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:36.888Z)

is also

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:36.977Z)

the report.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:38.108Z)

the old data, past data, and then we're not gonna predict that.

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:40.877Z)

Right. So so this is historical data coming from other sources.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:48.588Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:49.407Z)

So Right. Hotel Horizons and Lark give market data,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:15:51.628Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:15:54.957Z)

For the comp set, it would come from STR. And then this occupancy is basically taking you get from the broker. They'll they'll give you the historical information. And then over here is where I would input my forecast. Now something that just occurred to me, this subject occupancy should tie to all of the occupancy numbers here. Now since I'm using made up data, it probably doesn't. I you know, I didn't I take the time to make sure that these numbers the same between those two tabs. But you know, this is this is basically where we are right now. So what I'm thinking of is down here, this forecast method We have two different places. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:16:46.458Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:16:49.467Z)

So I've got my 75% growth here. And I've also got the 75% growth here. So I think what I'm going to do is make this page a report

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:17:02.028Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:17:03.537Z)

and then over here is where they can toggle How do I wanna forecast? If I wanna forecast actual occupancy, it'll be just like this. If I just wanna change by year over year growth, then then these cells become inputs and these would be calculated percentage based on what I put here. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:17:25.888Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:17:28.547Z)

So, you know, they're looking at you know, somebody may rather say, okay. I wanna do, you know, an average of this growth rate or a lot of the information that they'll get from Hotel Horizons or STR, their forecast wouldn't be actual occupancy. They would be forecasting what they think the year over year growth is. So that way, the user could use both. Okay. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:17:54.698Z)

Alright. Right.

### You (2025-05-30T19:17:55.357Z)

So yeah. I think I'll go ahead and make that change.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:17:56.618Z)

Okay. Cool.

### You (2025-05-30T19:17:59.287Z)

Cool. Let's go for a bad

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:01.438Z)

So for revenue analysis,

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:01.447Z)

and says,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:03.628Z)

we don't need anything from that investment

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:04.217Z)

don't anything from that investment interruptions. Right? Now from the

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:07.788Z)

assumptions. Right? From the flow that we are creating.

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:08.867Z)

flow that you're creating. Before

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:11.398Z)

Before. You remember? We had that new deal creation, and we had that big form.

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:11.557Z)

the end. Week. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, down here, what I labeled as the parking lot

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:19.238Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:19.767Z)

these are all of the old forms

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:22.078Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:22.577Z)

but I you know, I I disabled them. It doesn't actually open the modal here. I didn't want anybody to get confused, and we may not even use these or we we might later. But I just wanna take this one step at a time. So now I'm working on the revenue.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:41.478Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:42.097Z)

Yeah. You know, then I'll do the expense, and then we can talk about some of these other items here.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:47.888Z)

Okay. What is the difference between

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:48.347Z)

Right? So Yeah. Sure. So what is the difference between revenue on

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:52.208Z)

yeah. Sure. So what is the difference between revenue on the top and revenue under

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:54.057Z)

on the top and revenue and the Not much, really.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:18:56.638Z)

parking lot?

### You (2025-05-30T19:18:59.087Z)

Because it's it's here we had just inputs. So here on the operating revenue you know, we had certain inputs that we would put in here to get this information Whereas on this page, you've got the holistic view. Get to see everything historical, and forecast in a row format. So so so basically that was the difference. So remember on all of these items, the very first version I had, it was just a it was basically a keras You go and input data, then you click on next. Input data, click on next, but you don't see the results of that input.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:19:39.778Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:19:41.117Z)

So So that's why I wanna make sure that we can convert this carousel into something that's more user friendly and don't have to hop back and forth. You don't have to go anywhere.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:19:56.338Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:19:58.257Z)

Yeah. See, I I agree with that if we can just

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:19:59.558Z)

Yeah. I mean, that would be best if we can just

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:02.477Z)

make make, like,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:03.668Z)

may may, like, keep these field editables

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:03.717Z)

keep these free and added tables there. Somewhere.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:07.078Z)

there itself wherever it is required.

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:08.097Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And then we get some time

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:10.628Z)

Then based on that, you know, change the other numbers.

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:11.487Z)

change the other numbers. Yeah. And just like you do to get, you know, fancy.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:13.928Z)

Just like you did here in occupancy.

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:16.607Z)

So it is for every all

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:17.818Z)

So in this revenue, all we need from user is

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:18.557Z)

from user base. It that

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:21.458Z)

that occupancy one.

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:21.887Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Before

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:23.258Z)

To forecast.

### You (2025-05-30T19:20:24.567Z)

because that that's the way that both Diane and Mark is basically taking the historical, and then you include your growth rate up here. So you can see down here, you've got all of the the RevPAR and the ADR. It's basically the the the math is is calculated in here, so it'll take this, you know, like the ADR times the number of days and it'll and basically what is it's do doing is it's your room's revenue here. So know, this this is what this entire page is trying to get to.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:20:57.268Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:00.837Z)

It's just this row. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:03.368Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:03.467Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:05.998Z)

Cool. Of

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:07.507Z)

Cool. Cool. Yeah. I mean, that that makes sense. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:09.078Z)

Cool. Yeah. I mean, that that makes sense. Okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:13.537Z)

Okay. So for

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:16.038Z)

So for me,

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:16.717Z)

and should I focus on implementing this

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:18.938Z)

should I focus on implementing this page in the application?

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:20.397Z)

Not yet because I wanna get sign off from everybody. So I'm hoping our

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:27.128Z)

K.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:27.587Z)

call early next week. But what I was thinking if I don't know how much you've done for the what we used to call the pipeline or the deal details page.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:38.898Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:39.457Z)

Yeah. I think that I think that would be

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:21:40.818Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:21:42.867Z)

good because I think you and I need to get together and decide what do we wanna include on the property details. You know, this would be this would be step one. This is where I would input the deal. And then what other fields would the user be able to fill in later like, on the pipeline report? So I think that's probably a good place for for you to go. Oh, another thing I was gonna ask So this I think the the Invest AI logo here was the

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:12.598Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:15.887Z)

first one that you sent, but I think the one that I saw when you were demoing the other day had more of a blue and purple. Are we Yeah. I wanted to know as well. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:25.238Z)

I wanted to talk about that as well. So

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:27.807Z)

should I switch Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:29.188Z)

should I switch back and share my screen? Then we can also talk about the detail base. Yeah. Cool.

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:35.557Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:36.928Z)

I was playing around with those

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:37.857Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:39.128Z)

colors and all. So I actually wanted to ask you if this looks any better than that one because I realized on that one is, like, more greenish thing. And then whenever we are using those color, the entire team was looking very green.

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:52.757Z)

K. So one do we write? Do I have this one or do I have one that

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:22:55.388Z)

So which one do you like? You like this one, or you like the one you have?

### You (2025-05-30T19:22:58.447Z)

I honestly don't have much of a preference between the two. I'll I I like the colors of both. I was reading an article the other day

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:11.738Z)

Uh-huh.

### You (2025-05-30T19:23:12.617Z)

about design, and it was Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:14.498Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:23:15.257Z)

It was somebody who specifically chose the color orange because she said orange is comforting and blah blah blah. And I'm like, okay. Well, maybe we should research and see, okay, what colors would be appropriate for somebody who's working with numbers or anything that's like that? So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:36.928Z)

Yeah. That's a good

### You (2025-05-30T19:23:37.027Z)

they mean that is, well, maybe the green is good because green equals money. Right? But Yeah. I you know, personally,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:43.058Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:23:46.597Z)

I I think I like these colors better that you've got, the blue and the purple.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:51.128Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:23:51.157Z)

Yeah. But, yeah, I don't I don't really care one way or the other. Way we go. I don't know if Diane or Mark or Drew have a preference.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:23:56.788Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:00.217Z)

So Yeah. I do have very much

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:03.228Z)

I do have green one in a separate branch. So whenever we want to switch back,

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:03.527Z)

in a separate one. So whenever you want want to switch back, we can do that.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:07.898Z)

we can do that. But what I've been realizing is

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:09.477Z)

Is like, this is what we've heard

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:11.828Z)

like, this is what people have been going with. Like,

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:12.417Z)

going with. Right? He lot. Just one flag. Yeah. I've seen that.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:15.638Z)

lot of gradient and not just one flat color. And I thought probably I'll keep that

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:21.397Z)

That.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:23.388Z)

a shot and get your feedback.

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:24.517Z)

I do like the gradient on those bars. Start off blue and then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:29.678Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:29.817Z)

transition to purple. Yeah. That that's pretty cool. I don't remember. Does the original

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:38.448Z)

Oh,

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:38.517Z)

Yeah. No. The original the original Oh, it doesn't have but I I do have that

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:42.088Z)

original doesn't have, but I think I do have that logo stored in our

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:43.417Z)

low voice. Store. Howard. So. See.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:47.558Z)

thing. So let's see. I'm sure I put it there in the marketing folder, this new one.

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:49.167Z)

That there in the last thing for that is new one. It is. That's that's where I got. Well, that's where I got the blue and green one. But Yeah. 're one? Instead?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:24:56.968Z)

Even this one is there. I put this version as well.

### You (2025-05-30T19:24:56.977Z)

I want this one. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:01.178Z)

Yeah, please have a look. And then, you know, we can we can change entire color theme altogether. I was just playing around with this. Because, you know,

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:04.757Z)

And even though

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:09.838Z)

I think if it if it looks good, then it gives me more

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:13.937Z)

kind of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:14.068Z)

feeling of you know, kind of motivates me

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:16.597Z)

to put

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:17.208Z)

towards, you know, doing things. But if everything is collateral, just tabular data,

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:17.337Z)

things. But I'm that's what I

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:22.748Z)

then it's like, it's not that great. So I wanna make sure that it looks good so that, you know, we feel motivated that something is coming up.

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:28.827Z)

Yeah. Kind of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:30.758Z)

And it's

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:32.007Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:32.148Z)

kind of getting the shape of the application.

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:32.837Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we could we could, like,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:36.908Z)

And then what?

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:37.357Z)

take a screenshot of what we've put together maybe blur it a little bit. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:41.558Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:43.607Z)

Yeah. I mean, we could we could certainly do something like that. And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:48.698Z)

Yeah. So

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:49.597Z)

That's so bad. And then I don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:52.018Z)

that and then

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:53.407Z)

Live. Think

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:54.218Z)

do you like the idea of

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:57.427Z)

to board.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:25:58.398Z)

getting to the portfolio dashboard when the user logs in?

### You (2025-05-30T19:25:58.757Z)

That. Board. Allowed to say Yeah. So that Yeah. That makes perfect sense. That should be the first thing.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:02.648Z)

So that okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:04.377Z)

Okay. Cool. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:07.198Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:07.287Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:08.868Z)

And

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:09.027Z)

how would I describe Question on is it is it my is it my monitor or are you doing something or

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:11.018Z)

how do you like this Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:14.947Z)

are those icons on those card they are changing. Aren't they? They're kinda flashing? They have. Where is going? I do.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:22.808Z)

Have very light animation. Yes. Very light.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:23.197Z)

Yes. Yeah. Where are they? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Although, like I said, I did wonder is my

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:27.048Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:29.207Z)

monitor screwing up? But yeah. That is cool. Is it Yeah. That's fine. That's what it does.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:34.108Z)

Isn't

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:35.067Z)

Live

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:35.118Z)

It's not possible to live because those are, like, main numbers. People will probably value.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:41.267Z)

k.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:42.648Z)

So that and then did you like this one market? Opportunity map? Probably, we could somewhere else, but I thought probably

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:53.297Z)

Something called prefer it on the home page.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:54.648Z)

it would be good to show it on the home page itself.

### You (2025-05-30T19:26:56.107Z)

Itself.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:26:58.578Z)

But then, again, we have market performance and more than portfolio.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:02.547Z)

I'm I'm wondering if the map would be more appropriate to include on whatever we call it. We call it the deal list or the pipeline. Because do you have anything on here that shows the actual deals that they're working on? Yeah. They are

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:23.848Z)

They are here. Support for the breakdown, and then they have a

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:24.257Z)

support for it right now. They are presenting here. I'm open to

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:28.338Z)

recent deal here. I moved it.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:28.477Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:30.288Z)

Down just to show more interactive things on top.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:32.027Z)

But we same thing with the map. Maybe we put the map

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:33.758Z)

But recent deals are here.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:36.457Z)

down here so that what they see in the recent deals correlates to the dots on the map. Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:44.498Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:44.617Z)

yep. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:45.958Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:46.267Z)

Yeah. But I do

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:27:46.508Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We can do that. And then

### You (2025-05-30T19:27:49.287Z)

do like the way I love that. I I love the shading and the the three d effect. I always try to do the same on the ones that I've been building and it does look very nice. What

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:00.908Z)

Cool. Cool. And then these are, like, mock

### You (2025-05-30T19:28:00.917Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:04.978Z)

data right now because I was having some issues Like, I'm very close to using lot of stored processors and all that. I have lot of store present written here. I don't know whether you see these here on the left side, which says functions. So I'm trying to pull the data directly database and, you know, that will also validate where you know, the ETL process we ran, whether that worked. Correctly or not. But I did run the entire like, I out the entire database data and tried to compare it there. So

### You (2025-05-30T19:28:40.867Z)

close.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:41.448Z)

feel like it was pretty close. I don't know if something

### You (2025-05-30T19:28:42.497Z)

Something.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:45.068Z)

messed up, but that will figure out once.

### You (2025-05-30T19:28:45.257Z)

Know if Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:47.918Z)

Data is kind of connected.

### You (2025-05-30T19:28:51.377Z)

It's good.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:28:53.198Z)

So that and then as far as the the I think we already showed everyone this one deal.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:00.317Z)

Yeah. That's that's why I was wondering if, you know, do we call this

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:01.448Z)

Deal list page.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:05.197Z)

a deal details, deal listing, or pipeline Personally, I pipeline is is is is really commonly used in commercial real estate regardless of what property type.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:21.738Z)

Yeah. We can call it pipeline.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:23.577Z)

Sure. But yeah. That's only from an investment standpoint. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:25.538Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:29.677Z)

an asset manager if if they if they own the properties,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:31.558Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:34.857Z)

it's not a pipeline. It's a deal list. So I I think I made the comment on the call, like, could we have it dynamic or or maybe we do both, or maybe we just call it deal list or property list, whatever. I think because that, I think, is a good term

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:49.288Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:51.307Z)

that would be for everybody regardless of what the role is. You know? Here's my list. Here's my property list or whatever we call

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:29:58.848Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:29:59.077Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think you're gonna make that as

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:01.388Z)

And we can always make it dynamic for sure.

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:01.927Z)

Okay. Yep. Make the.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:04.408Z)

Yeah. Making dynamic sounds great to me as well.

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:04.647Z)

Some okay for me as well. If Yeah. You know?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:08.278Z)

If the, you know,

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:08.417Z)

Yeah. But you know what? Asset managers also are

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:11.438Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:12.427Z)

acquisition people. When I was an asset manager, I oversaw property operations, but I was also involved with acquisitions.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:17.058Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:21.457Z)

So that may not be a viable option in a in a situation like that. So more I think about it, the more I think we should just keep it with deal listing or property list or something along those lines because that works for no matter what your role is. Well, yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:44.338Z)

Yeah. I mean, I whatever, you know. We can finalize something. But and so instead of deals, should we call it?

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:51.447Z)

Or the property business.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:52.578Z)

Deal list?

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:53.357Z)

Yeah. Deal list or property lists. You know, that's something we

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:53.448Z)

Or property list? Something like that.

### You (2025-05-30T19:30:57.337Z)

bring up on the call. Yeah. Cool.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:30:59.268Z)

Yeah. Cool.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:01.237Z)

And then, this thing

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:03.028Z)

And then this table one, we already

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:06.447Z)

Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:06.678Z)

saw. Right? So this this lose

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:10.227Z)

find Yep. Yeah. That's no. That's great.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:12.148Z)

fine to you.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:13.617Z)

Yeah. And we have some things.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:15.068Z)

Yeah. I think we have most of these

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:16.337Z)

Yeah. I think they do add

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:18.238Z)

fields here, and then they do add up to the table. And then the other thing is

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:22.457Z)

how they derive already scrolled a small thing.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:24.268Z)

only the right part is crawls, not the the name. Right? The entire thing doesn't scroll. So they can kind of connect the data with the deal. Think we could probably show some something more here, probably

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:35.487Z)

Something or time.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:39.558Z)

some sort of map or some diagrams or something.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:39.967Z)

Or something.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:42.658Z)

Don't know.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:44.667Z)

Well, you know, you a lot of tools have a

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:45.178Z)

Or we just wanna keep it list.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:48.707Z)

a choice. Do you wanna see it as a list? Do you wanna see it on a map? Right? So, like, if you go to

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:54.248Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:55.797Z)

like, Expedia, a lot of those travel places

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:31:56.648Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:31:58.817Z)

I'm looking at hotels, you can look at one or the other. That's

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:01.258Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:02.017Z)

might be an option too. It's just

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:03.418Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:06.837Z)

They've planned away.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:08.298Z)

Different ways.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:10.097Z)

Of showing

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:11.328Z)

Of showing where and the map is one of the option. And one thing Diane was saying that if we could use

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:22.567Z)

they was

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:23.308Z)

Google Earth,

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:24.207Z)

So where do we see that?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:25.018Z)

So where do we see that use case for Google Earth

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:26.707Z)

In this case when COVID are the things that are

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:29.988Z)

Is it on this page? Or

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:30.297Z)

No. I don't think I I don't think so because that would be that would take up a lot of space. I think that would be at the end individual deal. I would have to be looking at fair investment and be on the fair investment page.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:45.538Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:46.507Z)

For that to really be applicable.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:47.108Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:48.877Z)

Okay. See you.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:51.078Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:51.297Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:52.188Z)

Here. Right? So probably we we should have that map somewhere.

### You (2025-05-30T19:32:54.327Z)

Yeah. So if we have the map here, then they could be click on the map to expand the map to take up the

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:32:58.028Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:00.607Z)

and then that would be the place where you want to say, do you wanna see a map or do you wanna see Google Earth? Yeah. Know, something along those lines.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:08.238Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:09.707Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:10.128Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:11.287Z)

But yeah. To to me, it wouldn't make sense being on the page that has all the properties listed. So Yeah. Yeah. Cool. I mean, this is our.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:21.128Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Cool. And then this is our deal detail page. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:23.907Z)

Yeah. Yep. And so this is where a lot of the stuff that I'm working right now, we would have to

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:30.578Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:32.007Z)

it somewhere in that left nav, and this is where they could you know, click in then I mean, this would be where we would have the summary.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:39.868Z)

No.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:40.277Z)

Right there at the very top. And, you know, suppose

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:43.768Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:43.777Z)

those those KPIs But then somewhere around here, we would click to go to the revenue page where they could make alter revisions or expenses if etcetera, occupancy,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:33:57.018Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:33:58.617Z)

So, yeah, we we would need to determine how we would want to do that. Yeah. Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:06.968Z)

Yep. Yep. Yep.

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:07.107Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:09.048Z)

Yep. Quarter quarter revenue. Let's say, when you're a routing revenue or other

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:16.387Z)

Pretty much everything. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:19.558Z)

things as well. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:21.297Z)

I think we

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:21.958Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:22.167Z)

have a revenue section expense section. And then if they have other operated groups, like food and beverage, banquet,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:29.518Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:32.337Z)

That's where we need to determine, like, yeah, how how we wanna lay that out. Do we just want something that expands on a single page, or do we wanna have a different page for each? I'm not sure. You know, that's Yeah. Groups and get some

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:46.988Z)

We can always yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:49.437Z)

get some information back from the users.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:49.578Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:52.077Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:52.848Z)

Yeah. The best I've seen lately, people have

### You (2025-05-30T19:34:53.327Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:34:56.948Z)

very small tabular formats on the top. You can really click on those small buttons. They're really very small. And

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:03.607Z)

You know, all the kind of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:05.568Z)

all the kind of deal details

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:05.907Z)

the details. Could just be on click on those steps.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:09.808Z)

could just be on click of those tabs.

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:10.527Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like the little pill buttons, you mean? Or Yeah. Yeah. The pill button.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:16.838Z)

Yeah. A little pill button on the top. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:18.207Z)

That'd be very cool. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:23.948Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:26.477Z)

Okay. So that is the

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:28.348Z)

Okay. So that is that.

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:29.257Z)

So Hello. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:34.228Z)

So, yeah, I think

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:35.247Z)

what I'm trying to do is

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:36.048Z)

okay. So what I'm gonna do is

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:39.337Z)

what

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:41.168Z)

whatever details you have right now in that, I'll probably add those

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:42.527Z)

I'll probably add those Okay. Probably some sort of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:46.138Z)

tabs here.

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:47.717Z)

k. Yeah. And I think oh, I think it has some placeholder then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:48.178Z)

Some sort of landing pages. Right? And with at least have some placeholder, then we'll decide how

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:52.357Z)

decided how hang on. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:54.968Z)

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:55.457Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:35:56.598Z)

Cool. And, I mean,

### You (2025-05-30T19:35:57.347Z)

Cool. And I'm So I can't say this one. Okay?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:01.418Z)

I was so and you did see this one. Right? Does this look fine to you?

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:03.017Z)

Just just to find it. That's like this.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:06.288Z)

Sorry. This.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:07.017Z)

And this suggest, like, we're just trying to keep our communication.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:09.048Z)

I think this this is, like, pretty standard people are doing these days.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:11.257Z)

Yeah. Especially when we get to things like the page I'm working on,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:16.628Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:16.867Z)

know, I Yeah. I only had five years, but if they had ten years, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:19.888Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:21.717Z)

we're want as much room there. So, yeah, that's that would be perfect just to have the collapsible sidebar.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:28.718Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:31.837Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:31.938Z)

Cool. And then as far as our net navigation goes, accept the space with things like if you are on the details

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:43.027Z)

That week.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:43.208Z)

then, you know, everything related to that page.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:43.947Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:45.708Z)

Is tabular.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:46.997Z)

We don't have to do

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:47.098Z)

But another thing would be on the left bar, most most probably most of the things won't be there.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:51.057Z)

Yeah. Cool. Very cool.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:58.018Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:58.647Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:36:58.778Z)

And

### You (2025-05-30T19:36:59.447Z)

Yep. So so so think it, like, maybe

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:00.768Z)

yep. Yep. So so for now, probably that's what I'm gonna focus on. One thing is, like, bringing the real data everywhere. Half of it, like this table this table does bring in real data. So if I show you a refresh.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:15.837Z)

Oh, yeah. K. It's let's see.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:25.768Z)

Yes. So let's see what we have.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:28.287Z)

We have. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:31.738Z)

So, yeah, this is real data here.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:34.437Z)

And the that's the data from Drew?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:34.458Z)

We have this data coming from database directly. Drew. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:39.667Z)

Okay. And when I go to

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:43.368Z)

And then when I go to deals, detail page, I think some of it should be good. 33.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:52.307Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:37:52.488Z)

So yeah. Here, we have the deal details. Yep.

### You (2025-05-30T19:37:56.787Z)

K. Very good.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:02.778Z)

Yeah. The all the real data that I don't have is on the prop like, portfolio page and, you know, some of these

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:09.747Z)

Things I was trying to Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:12.158Z)

I was trying to create.

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:12.757Z)

Market.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:13.848Z)

These market trends, these things. So, yeah, I'm kinda trying to bring in real data and then evaluate The other thing I wanted to focus on is the AI part. I've been doing some research, like, what all we can do and what

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:29.467Z)

One. What tools we can use. How much it can cost.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:32.198Z)

we can use, how much it is gonna cost.

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:35.347Z)

Like, how

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:36.128Z)

I have done, like, half of the research. So I'm kind of finalizing that, and then I can present. We can discuss that and, you know, see what all we can

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:45.357Z)

Cool. Yeah. I

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:45.518Z)

do there. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:38:48.377Z)

I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it. You know, I think the first question is, what will we use AI for? Correct. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:38:59.078Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-30T19:39:01.697Z)

You know, I think there's a lot things we could do for just general research. Where it's pulling up In fact, I saw a demo

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:39:14.938Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:39:15.537Z)

someone was using I know if it was Notebook LM or Gemini. One of one of the tools where it's more of a research tool than anything else for travel planning, and I'm thinking, that would be very applicable because it can talk you can get information on weather, historical weather, what's the weather like at this time of year? Or and and and what is the you know, different things related that probably won't necessarily be on the other reports that they're getting because I think the other reports, like I STR, they're they're it's data. It's just occupancy and rent. Or, I mean, revenue, things like that. So

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:39:56.588Z)

Yeah. Alright.

### You (2025-05-30T19:39:58.427Z)

that's that's about the only thing I was thinking of at first. And then, of

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:40:00.718Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:40:03.397Z)

you can always have it, like, write up a summary of whatever we have in there. But But I'm sorry?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:40:10.968Z)

But I think predictions are market predictions, future predictions.

### You (2025-05-30T19:40:11.317Z)

Market predictions. That's definitely If we have enough data to start doing that, that would be huge.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:40:15.908Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:40:22.897Z)

And if we are, bringing in other data besides what our users upload. I mean, that was always the biggest problem with Rede is we just didn't have the volume of data necessary to really do anything. But I don't think we have that restriction here because we can bring in third party data that we couldn't at RedIQ, which we could probably get to that point where we can forecast sooner rather than later. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:40:51.068Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. And data yeah. We'll have to see. Data generally I don't know. Outside how much

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:01.577Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:02.018Z)

that costing and all that. And then through you know, when we are gonna look at data from Drew, I think we do need to get that sooner because more data we have, we can do more stuff.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:16.687Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:16.798Z)

And what other thing are the

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:17.347Z)

I like

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:18.818Z)

As far as

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:19.457Z)

going live.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:20.348Z)

like,

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:20.847Z)

With things

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:21.338Z)

going live with these things,

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:23.207Z)

going live

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:26.338Z)

Right? We'll have to this up somewhere on the server. Definitely work out some, you know, server for free, some free database.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:30.507Z)

server. Small, but we can definitely find something

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:34.958Z)

It's gonna be a little slow, but

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:36.687Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:36.838Z)

we can definitely find something.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:38.077Z)

Alright. I know

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:39.398Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:41.757Z)

super bass. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:43.748Z)

Yeah. Superbase is there. Yeah. I

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:45.287Z)

And they're free, and I think we'll allow you to have two different

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:48.628Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:49.737Z)

two separate databases

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:41:54.198Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:41:54.257Z)

or projects And I I don't think that I don't know if there's any size limit to them for the free ones. There there might be, but I don't think a POC would ever exceed

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:02.768Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:05.517Z)

whatever their limits are.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:08.108Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:08.837Z)

So that's that's

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:11.108Z)

They do have some limitations.

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:12.117Z)

yeah. Wait.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:13.888Z)

Yeah. I remember there are some wearing limitation or something that when I was working with Supercase. For the version, but that should be fine.

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:20.037Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:24.988Z)

So that what else would help? What I'm thinking? And then I think we should kind of continue pushing these guys

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:31.567Z)

To where.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:33.368Z)

you know, get funding and try to focus on sales and getting customers. Because at some point, we need to say, yeah, this is

### You (2025-05-30T19:42:39.567Z)

Point,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:42:43.358Z)

it that we're gonna do this much now because know, probably you can focus more on job one thing or something. I could also focus on similar thing. You know, this is where stop now, go and get either funding or someone who can, you know, who is ready to certain take a subscription or something. Right? Because they they we can continue

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:02.167Z)

they they we can continue you know,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:07.248Z)

there can be a lot to do in this application and, you know, we can do

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:07.727Z)

this application and, you know, we can go Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:11.708Z)

a lot of things here.

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:12.307Z)

But some point,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:13.818Z)

At some point, we do need to, you know,

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:14.667Z)

that. At

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:17.528Z)

cannot be, like, unemployed or not getting money from this forever.

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:20.207Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, that's one of the things we've talked about is if we wanna get funding, we have to prove people will buy our products. So we do have to get somebody Not not just one. We do have to have at least, you know, maybe three to five

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:37.968Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:38.207Z)

clients. So There's there's a lot of work we need to do on on payroll, you know, contracts. And terms and conditions,

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:43:48.378Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:43:48.727Z)

and all that stuff that we nobody's even talked about that point. Part yet. So I think that probably falls into my category. Yeah. Not the con maybe not the sales contract.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:00.588Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:03.127Z)

I don't know if Mark can help with that or Drew might have something. I don't know. But we do have to get something pricing. We haven't even talked about what we can charge for something like this. So yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:16.748Z)

And then we do have like, we kind of have our website ready too. We can mean, we'll need to put in some

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:23.847Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:25.828Z)

to run that online. It might not be a lot of money, but at least some. Sooner we get there, probably someone can start marketing and you know, sales type of thing. I think we should draw a line, like, you know, at this point,

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:39.017Z)

At this point, Oh, don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:43.868Z)

you are good to go. Right? But I will continue

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:47.667Z)

Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:47.758Z)

adding features, but then there might be some someone else already working on similar ideas.

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:51.027Z)

someone have a story of walking up.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:44:55.988Z)

And they they get all the clients.

### You (2025-05-30T19:44:57.827Z)

Yeah. No. No. I think if we can get this core feature, which is to come up with evaluation. So revenue expenses

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:45:06.908Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:45:07.447Z)

occupancy, you know, any of the ancillary things. We should be we have to have that.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:45:15.988Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:45:16.177Z)

So Yeah. I'm I'm almost done with the revenue and the occupancy part.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:45:19.398Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:45:20.717Z)

I just need to work on food and beverage and everything else, but remember on that last call, I started to talk about food and beverage, and Drew and Mark, you know, could made a very good point that, you know, let's the revenue done first and do that. So I haven't done anything else on the other

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:45:34.498Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:45:38.277Z)

that looked even very pretty simple too. Mark's Well, no. Actually, I think, Diane's spreadsheet had a much simpler process, calculating the revenue and expenses. So that'll be done fairly easily. And then Yeah. Expenses, I I haven't looked at marks yet.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:02.918Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:46:05.687Z)

Diane, a lot of theirs were just based on a percentage of revenue. So you know, I could say my personnel is 10% of my revenue.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:15.938Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:46:16.447Z)

Right. And so maybe, at least for the proof of concept, we can do that. You know? I I do need to take a look at Mark's, though, because he may have a better process. But I think we can hit that target. And we can start showing this to some of the people that Diane want. To get together with.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:40.238Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-30T19:46:42.217Z)

Two weeks, I'm still a little bit nervous about that. But but, yeah, I think June, we should be able to

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:49.848Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:46:51.527Z)

calls.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:54.238Z)

Right. Right. And as far as that revenue analysis goes, we are waiting

### You (2025-05-30T19:46:59.497Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:46:59.638Z)

feedback from these guys. Right?

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:00.347Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:01.448Z)

I think they posted yesterday.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:04.787Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It's only been there for a day. So I'll

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:05.968Z)

Right? Seven eight eight. Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:08.257Z)

I'll and then I can send out a reminder email.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:12.358Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:12.867Z)

Let them know we wanna talk about it on our next call. Do we have our next call scheduled next week?

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:20.808Z)

No. I think Diane was saying, Mark is out somewhere.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:23.737Z)

Yeah. Well, I I

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:25.648Z)

In some conference.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:27.917Z)

I have the original at 01:30 on my calendar.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:28.498Z)

We don't have to really yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:31.507Z)

So I don't know if we're gonna keep that or not. But either way, I'm gonna tell them that I need their feedback before that call so that we can move on to the next section.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:40.838Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:41.377Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:41.498Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:42.887Z)

You don't have to work for it. And that will

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:45.208Z)

Don't have to wait for

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:45.467Z)

No. No.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:46.498Z)

entire week.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:47.487Z)

So alright. Well, yeah. I've I've kind of made some problems and problems.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:49.358Z)

Also, yeah, I'll I'll kind of make some progress and probably will catch up mostly on Monday.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:55.837Z)

Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:47:57.838Z)

Sounds good. Sounds good.

### You (2025-05-30T19:47:58.607Z)

Anything else? That's all. Thank you. Alright. Well, glad you're feeling at least a little bit better. Hope you get

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:48:02.618Z)

That's all our thank you.

### You (2025-05-30T19:48:06.947Z)

better over the weekend.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:48:07.978Z)

Yep. Yep.

### You (2025-05-30T19:48:10.057Z)

Thank you very much. Yeah. Bye. Have a nice weekend.

### Guest (2025-05-30T19:48:11.868Z)
