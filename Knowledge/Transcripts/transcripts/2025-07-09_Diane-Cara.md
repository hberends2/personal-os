### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:19.496Z)

clients that this is real, that we can actually do this

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:19.555Z)

real. That we can actually do this. Is the

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:22.996Z)

And this is the the kind of the structure of what it's gonna look like.

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:23.165Z)

the kind of the structure of what gonna look like. It's very rare bones.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:27.006Z)

It's very bare bones,

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:27.065Z)

But we're we're getting them.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:28.696Z)

but we're we're getting there. We're really getting to the NOI, and we're getting to, like, the

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:28.875Z)

Really getting to the end of the day, and to like, the cash on cash return and all of

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:33.156Z)

on cash returns and all of that.

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:34.985Z)

And so hoping

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:35.886Z)

And so I'm hoping what we can do today is

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:36.175Z)

we can do today. Walk you through the proof of

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:39.056Z)

walk you through the proof of concept, kinda plant the seed in your mind,

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:39.145Z)

concept kind of plant the seed your mind. And then maybe you could help us bring

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:43.876Z)

maybe you could help us brainstorm on just your thoughts about how

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:44.435Z)

storm. On just your thought. About you know, who we might

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:49.226Z)

know, who we might go who we might approach from a client perspective,

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:49.465Z)

go. Who we might go. Go from a client. Perspective. And on the debt structure finance.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:54.196Z)

on the data and structured finance space, who we might approach from

### You (2025-07-09T17:51:54.295Z)

Base, who we might approach from. Like, a customer, but who also

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:51:59.116Z)

like, a, like, a customer, but who also we might approach from a

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:00.315Z)

find approach from a best perspective.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:03.726Z)

investor perspective

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:04.065Z)

Because I

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:05.756Z)

because I've heard repeatedly that Cindy Estes Green got her start by essentially, like, a pass the hat.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:06.705Z)

repeatedly that Sydney has is great. Got her star by essentially, like, a past that had with in this friend.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:14.436Z)

With industry friends, you know, folks like and I it's probably not these exact

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:15.075Z)

You know, focus on it. And that is probably not decent. Exact people. But Rob. Climb.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:19.166Z)

people, but Rob Klein and Steve Casalica and

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:19.895Z)

Steve Casella, and know, Steve Angel.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:22.996Z)

you know, Steve Angel. But you you know that the people that essentially perhaps

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:23.255Z)

But you you know, that the people that sense like, perhaps can't write chart.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:27.966Z)

can write a check for

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:27.985Z)

For 10 different 50 k.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:30.016Z)

10 or 50 k and might have some interest in this family office,

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:30.035Z)

And might have some interest in it. Family owned. Bed. So the

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:34.956Z)

So those are the things that are on our mind, and we just

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:35.325Z)

things that that are their mind. And we just wanna start to show

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:38.966Z)

wanted to start to show the POC to some friends. And I consider you a

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:39.025Z)

the piece. To some front end. And I consider here. A friend. The extreme.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:43.396Z)

friend in the industry. Women support each other.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:44.185Z)

Women support child better

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:47.556Z)

And we're we're really lucky in this industry that we do.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:50.955Z)

that's

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:51.116Z)

And then let that settle and and get your thoughts on it.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:51.335Z)

settle minded difference the thoughts. On it. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:54.316Z)

Okay. That sounds good.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:54.345Z)

Okay. Good. Alright. I'm gonna my interest

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:52:57.116Z)

Alright. My my interest has peaked for sure.

### You (2025-07-09T17:52:57.645Z)

is peaked for sure. They keep mind. Proof of concept. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:00.796Z)

Now keep in mind, proof of concept. Right? So it this is like

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:01.755Z)

So it's is like it's a video they tell us

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:04.896Z)

it's a they they tell us that if a year from now, we don't look back at this,

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:05.605Z)

a year from now, we don't look back. At this. And we're not kind of

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:09.416Z)

not kind of why wildly embarrassed by what we showed people

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:09.745Z)

why in there. By what we showed people and this is feel like it's really good.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:13.726Z)

And this is we feel like it's really good. But then we've spent way too much time on the

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:14.165Z)

But spent way much time on the proof of concept, right, So

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:18.516Z)

of concept. Right? So the part of it is we have to move

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:19.035Z)

thing we have to move now No. POs

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:21.796Z)

now from POC to an MVP

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:22.415Z)

to an MVP that we can act start

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:25.236Z)

that we can actually start to physically, you know, truly test out and

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:25.295Z)

to fit the you know, truly test out and close to being to test this.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:30.206Z)

really close to being able to test this, though. So I'll stop.

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:30.325Z)

Though. So I'll start because I've a little again. Too much, and

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:33.586Z)

Because I've rambled again too much, and Howard will take it over. And

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:34.605Z)

will take it over. Over. Do the demo.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:37.636Z)

do the demo.

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:38.805Z)

Alright. You should be seeing my screen right now with the InnVestAI. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:53:47.126Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T17:53:47.255Z)

Alright. So I I don't want to make this a sales demo. Where I'm getting into the weeds so I will kinda walk through the process. If at any time you have a question or a comment, just feel free to jump right in.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:54:00.576Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-09T17:54:01.205Z)

Okay. So the idea really is to have a tool that will displace Excel. Number one for underwriting have a I have a very long term lengthy and intimate relationship with Excel and consider myself to be a guru I'm able to write VBA and, and I'm very familiar with it. But having that level of knowledge also makes me understand how bad Excel can be. Many times, right? So you've got people who will overwrite a formula. They'll hard input a number. They'll forget about it and go on to the next model. You know, I've got some research that was done a few years ago showing that up to 80% of all Excel models have an error. Somewhere. So so, yeah, it's yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:54:55.846Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T17:54:56.845Z)

Of the things we want to get away from that is to to to be able to standardize, but also the fact that this is way faster for the users than going through Excel where you're jumping from tab to tab and you make a change in one tab, you have to go somewhere else to see the effect of that change and it's just really a mess. So what I'm trying to do here is to create a tool where you can work on the screen here going down these various tabs of on the side here,

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:55:27.136Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T17:55:29.025Z)

time. But always have visibility into where you are. And what the numbers are revealing at any time. Quickly we'll go through, you know, the very first thing you want to do is you want to set up the deal. So you can enter the the property name, and go through here and and and just go through each of these cells input the information including the specific property type. Because one thing that mention here later on is we do want to aggregate the data anonymize it, and be able to provide users comparisons to the deal they are underwriting versus the market. We wanna make sure that we've gotten apples to apples comparison into the property types, So we can do that. There's other information here. We also have the ability to upload picture so you can have that on your on your page. But we also have a section that we're building out right now for any document to be able to upload and have all documents related to the deal in one place. And then the next screen here, this is something that is going to help with the forecasting for both the revenue and the expense for the other income. Type sections. The idea being that I have a model that I'm gonna go through here on the pro form a page. And that model can get pretty long if I include everything, so what this is going do, this is going to select which items are available in the model for underwriting. Now currently, we're keeping it at these three top levels, just the food and beverage, other operated and miscellaneous. But in the by the time we get to the MVP, you can actually be able to include subcategories. Right? So if I wanted to see my food and beverage, I may not have a restaurant or room service, but I may have a bar. So I can just check on that so that when I go to the pro form a and I start underwriting, I can get down to that bar level But many people from my understanding just keep it at the keeps keeps it at the high level. Right? So you know, it's it's up to the user to to be able to budget any way that they want. So once that deal is set up, then you can move on to the next step, is the market data. We have one page here then which would be the external market comps. You can

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:58:09.046Z)

And are these populated by a report that you upload?

### You (2025-07-09T17:58:11.235Z)

for populate? Yes. It it's gonna be a number of ways.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:58:14.016Z)

Or how are these comps populated?

### You (2025-07-09T17:58:16.775Z)

So, yes, they will be able to drag a report in there. You can see this is actually the star report. So they'll be able to upload copies of the star report for the comps that they've identified We hope and fully expect that in the future we will have sufficient data to basically report the exact same thing a star report does. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:58:42.166Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T17:58:43.245Z)

So they can go through, select the properties, that are direct competitors, view this information here, I didn't I didn't really explain over here, but you know, you've got the star code here in the left hand column. When I set up this property, this census ID is the same thing as the star. ID. We're building it out with the expectation that I can

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:59:02.896Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T17:59:05.765Z)

put in the star ID and then it'll come up with the comps that are related to that. The other thing on the comps comps in ours, we've got two tables now. That the user would upload. And manually input Right? It's my understanding that this is an industry very much like multifamily where everybody knows everybody else. And they're gonna get on the phone and they're gonna call these properties to get more information. And track it. Know, here I can I can upload information and I can just identify that, you know, hotel two, is a competitor to the hotel one? That I'm buying.

### Guest (2025-07-09T17:59:46.866Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T17:59:48.565Z)

And I can go in here and input the information. So I might have information from 2023, and, you know, it would be you know, year to date information. Available rooms, it might be 250. And then when I input the occupancy, let's say it's 83.2 you know, it's going to calculate the rev rev par here. You know, and I can input the ADR, whatever that happens to be. Notes, etcetera. So you can you can see where this is going. You know, that I might do the same thing for 2024. I can do this for as many properties as I want, so here's my first comp, know, I can click on add a property, there's the next you know, keep going as many comps as I need where I can input this. Again, I think in the future as we get more data and using some of the agentic AI capabilities that we plan on building that can go out to specific reports. Can pre populate a lot of this too. We don't necessarily have to have the user go and manually do this.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:00:53.526Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:00:54.035Z)

Same thing like with the transaction summary. So if I'm tracking all of the sales, for that comp, you know, same thing, could input the property name, the year that it's sold, I can input the renovation amounts, you know, buyer, seller, the lender notes, and these are basically me as an InnVestAI user filling in specific information to this deal that I think is good to have as I go through the whole underwriting process. That make sense?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:01:28.926Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-09T18:01:29.425Z)

So far? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Good. So the next step in the process after I've done that is we're going to get to the valuation. And this is where I can put in my investment assumptions, the hurdles, the area that I want to get to, my ROI IRR, So here I can go through, I've got three different sections I've got an acquisition, I've got my financing assumptions, and same thing with my exit. Exit cap rate sales expense, etc. All of these will then help to calculate this information down at the bottom. In addition, this is where I'm going to start getting this information. Now these metric cards will always be visible at the top of the screen from this point forward because anytime I make an input in it's a real time calculation. So if I come down and I put in my acquisition cost here, of 1%, you know, right now you can see the lender fees are $3.67 50, You know, if it comes out to be 2%, Oh, I forgot. I had a demo yesterday. I forgot. This is this is not hooked up. The other pages are. I'm sorry. But, yes, this this is

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:02:45.696Z)

It's okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:02:47.605Z)

yeah. Don't hate me because it's it's not calculating. Yeah. But

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:02:52.596Z)

No. No. It's fine. I I get the

### You (2025-07-09T18:02:54.515Z)

but you can see where it's going.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:02:56.546Z)

gist of it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:02:57.695Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:02:57.866Z)

This is a really nice dashboard, by the way.

### You (2025-07-09T18:02:58.755Z)

Yeah. The financing, same thing here. If I put in the 60% loan to value, this one I'm pretty sure is hooked up. The loan amount should change down below. If it's let me see. Yeah. No. It's not. Anyway, we'll get that going. Yeah. So so you put in the same thing here, but another thing that's been requested

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:03:20.956Z)

Yeah. It's okay. It's okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:03:24.345Z)

and that I I do have work worked up on another tool here is for example, the loan fees. Now you can base it just on the percentage of the loan, or I know some people like to get into the wheat, so this is a mock up of what we're going to be changing there. So you've got the same inputs over here but for the loan fee, I can choose. If I want to have percentage of loan amount, you know, then I can come in here and and and change whatever that is. This one you can see the lenders fees as I make these changes Does does calculate down. Right? So I just put in the 2%

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:03:59.636Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-07-09T18:04:02.635Z)

know, my my lender fees now are double what they were before. But if I wanna really get line by line, then I can select

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:04:06.466Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:04:10.285Z)

detail at which point this is no longer valid and I can come in here and I can put in my my cost. You know, maybe it's a 50 bps origination fee, maybe the underwriting fee is a flat $5,000. And so you can see there now that's controlling that. So Based on the user feedback and trying to implement it right at the very beginning. You can see as we go through and everything is calculated live, we will be able to track all of this information. Right now, just as an FYI, these numbers are not going to change They're just hard input numbers just so you can kinda see how the layout works. Yeah. So any any other questions then on on

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:04:55.346Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:04:56.895Z)

on the valuation portion? Not yet. Okay. Okay. So now we're getting into the real

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:05:04.496Z)

Not not yet.

### You (2025-07-09T18:05:06.555Z)

meat.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:05:06.566Z)

I mean,

### You (2025-07-09T18:05:07.425Z)

Of

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:05:07.476Z)

I'm intrigued.

### You (2025-07-09T18:05:08.225Z)

the the program here. This is where I'm gonna start putting together my pro form a. And again, always will keep these cards at the top so you can see the effect of the inputs, but we also have some very specific key metrics that are tied to the groups down here. I've got my first metric here, which is a very kind of high overview of you know, what is my occupancy ADR RevPAR. And this historical information that you can see here is what would be uploaded by the broker, the investor, or any user You upload your historical documents, and so you'll see the historical

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:05:45.416Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:05:46.935Z)

data there. Now for this particular deal, when it was set up, we would input a whole period of five years, but it could be three, could be ten, but whatever you put in for a whole period is how many periods will be here for the forecast. In addition we have occupancy metrics, so we can get into more detail there. We've got a breakdown of the revenue. And you can see my other operated revenue is rolled up, but if I want to see the detail, I click on the detail and see that. It depends on, you know, what level of detail are you wanting to see. And then same thing with the expenses. Okay? Yeah. And that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:29.606Z)

And can I jump in for one second? And that is, you know, we have work

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:29.795Z)

data. Can great job.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:33.616Z)

to do on how we're we're getting the data in the model. But right

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:35.115Z)

Drop. Five the same.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:37.026Z)

IQ did did a great job of, like, being able to drop

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:38.795Z)

Yeah. But let's take, like, July and Flint.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:41.566Z)

files in, and then they would pull it up into the model.

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:41.845Z)

Perfect. She has a really big portfolio. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:44.856Z)

But let's take, like, Julie Pernell and Flynn for a minute.

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:45.045Z)

Now. It was the the former high gate stop. There's third manage.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:48.446Z)

She has a really big portfolio. Right? And a lot of it was the the former Highgate stuff. They're

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:49.545Z)

And Drew who are co one of our cofounder has provided. Her.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:53.416Z)

a management company. And Drew, our co one of our cofounders,

### You (2025-07-09T18:06:53.525Z)

All that. Data. So we envision the future, like, two years from now,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:06:57.996Z)

provides her all that data. So we envision a future, like, two years from now

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:00.565Z)

community that's right. Really if you're

if we can get the ownership community behind us, right,

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:05.295Z)

especially on death structured finance because hotels get

where, really, if you're especially on debt and structured finance because

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:09.395Z)

refinanced. And it single day. Right? That in three years.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:13.756Z)

hotels get refinanced

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:14.125Z)

Releases this data. To

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:15.756Z)

every single day. Right? That an operator simply releases this data to Drew Drew digitally pulls it up or or

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:15.805Z)

drink. Drew digitally pulls it on board. Or they release it. Invest. AI. You're part of the best AI. So I wanna be using these. Terms. To get them right.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:25.446Z)

release it to InnVestAI. Drew's part of InnVestAI, so I can I'm using these

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:25.995Z)

But they're they're in good year. We will have it down.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:29.666Z)

terms together. Right? But they're

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:29.955Z)

They're digital transfer from the operator direct. Directly and on it.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:32.866Z)

they're in in a few years, we will have it down pat that there's a digital transfer

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:33.465Z)

End of historic set. The budget, the trailing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:36.906Z)

from the operator directly in on any of the historicals, the budget,

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:37.205Z)

twelve. The forecast, you know, all the stuff right now. Update. Automatic.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:41.876Z)

the trailing 12, the forecast, you know, all the

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:41.985Z)

Automatically. So that it have to come in and then

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:45.046Z)

stuff. Right? And it and it can just update automatically.

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:45.235Z)

month. Doing. The refund. Process. When they get my

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:48.216Z)

So that an analyst doesn't have to come in and every month during the refinancing process

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:48.655Z)

new monthly financing we'll go back.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:53.186Z)

when they get a new a new

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:54.195Z)

That what had. We we trick

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:56.306Z)

monthly financial, go back in and update the trailing 12 and you know? So

### You (2025-07-09T18:07:57.295Z)

techno with power

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:07:59.956Z)

that's where we're headed. And with

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:00.105Z)

in the window. Knowing it. Much about data.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:02.396Z)

with Drew's technology,

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:02.525Z)

Transfer.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:04.526Z)

and with Howard and Vinod knowing as much about data and data transfer

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:05.425Z)

There. Take us a little bit of time. And a little bit little bit of time. Shift.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:08.866Z)

as they do,

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:09.255Z)

From the ownership.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:10.196Z)

we're gonna get there. It's just gonna take us a little bit of time and a little bit of shift

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:10.685Z)

Community. This. Sense.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:14.926Z)

from the ownership

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:15.515Z)

But everyone goal is

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:16.486Z)

community and kind of how they think think about this, if if that if that makes sense.

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:16.665Z)

so that no one really has to touch this stuff. And if few years. It just

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:20.916Z)

But that's our goal is so that no one

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:21.425Z)

gets digitally run. From. From

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:23.906Z)

really has to touch this stuff in a few years. It just gets digitally routed

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:24.115Z)

breaker. Into deal. Ecosystem. Ecosystem. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:28.366Z)

from from operator into the deal

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:28.825Z)

Interesting. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:31.706Z)

ecosystem.

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:31.835Z)

Carry on. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:32.896Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:33.745Z)

So again this is where I can

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:34.286Z)

Interesting.

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:36.085Z)

get into the weeds, but I don't want to. Let me just I know you get the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:08:36.116Z)

Okay. Carry on.

### You (2025-07-09T18:08:41.055Z)

high level overview here. So know, you can go through here and how you've got your row by row occupancy inputs, your ADR, etcetera. But we recognize that different people have different ways of how they like to do it. So on most of these lines where there are different ways of doing it, If it's yellow, this would be like a user input, If it's just a white background, it's a calculated field. So I may just want to manually input my expected occupancy here. So as if I choose occupancy in this drop down cell, then I can go through this row and input essentially whatever I want that occupancy to be, it could be just continuing on from the prior year could be 78.6 and go, you know, 77.3 or two, whatever. Right? So you can go and put anything there.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:09:38.016Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:09:38.085Z)

Other people just like to take a look at the year over year growth. Right? So I can do them the same thing here. So, you know, I might want a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:09:45.936Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:09:46.475Z)

1.5% increase you know, maybe minus two. I mean, why do I know why we're want it. Forecast a decline, but so same thing there. Right? So you've got an option of how you wanna input it. Same thing, very similar down here. For forecasting my ADR growth. I can go ahead and put in a flat growth here and then whatever I input into this cell will be populated throughout here, so it's going to calculate the 2% going through here or if I want to do the same thing input my own yearly growth, if I select that, now these cells become live. And I would go through and input that. Okay? And then scrolling down here, RevPar, this is all calculated, there's no information you get there. But once I've gone through and put in my forecast and I'd have my RevPAR calculated there, These first few rows are actually data that we would get from HBIS or other sources. And they're historical only, which is why there's no data up here. So I got my historical information from these other sources, my subject property, and then I can use this information then to go through my assumptions. Revenue. Very similar down here. So this is, you know, based on my occupied per year. So if I put in my $60 there, you know, tab over and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:10:58.966Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:11:15.795Z)

61, That's how I'm gonna go through and create my food and beverage revenue. Same thing down here for all the other operated under occupied, etcetera. And then getting down into the expense. Now there there is an option, you know, we're going to make an option here for the revenue. We're you can either do it on a per occupied room basis or just hard input the number here. Maybe instead of going with you know, I might just want to put in a million 8,000,007 you know, whichever way you prefer. I I don't know how popular that is. I I seems to me that in all the conversations I've had that it really is kinda based on the occupier

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:11:57.406Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:12:00.715Z)

rooms per year. Expenses, however, we do have three different ways of inputting them. We can go with the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:12:08.286Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:12:09.975Z)

preoccupied room and same thing here, if I put in 52, 53, it's all gonna go through and calculate everything. But I also have the option of basing it on the percentage revenue or just manually inputting it, but I'll just do everything here just to show that it it is live. So my percentage of revenue, if I select that, what it's going to happen is is it's going to calculate the percentage here. I'm sorry, chose the wrong row here. Percentage of revenue, down here, it'll go through and calculate Oh, wait a minute. Did that Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. Alright. So percentage of revenue works. And, you know, so so same thing here. I can put in my 40% you know, 50%. Now I don't have the percentage really actually calculating yet, It's only based on the POR, but you can see where that's going. See that. Yeah. Same same thing for the manual input. You know? I might just Yeah. Go seven 100,008 100,000 whatever. Whatever.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:13:12.446Z)

I'm I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's great.

### You (2025-07-09T18:13:12.705Z)

And so that's that's how we'll go through the expenses. Now not

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:13:14.886Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:13:16.325Z)

all of those expenses would be calculated that way. You know, for example, your your management fees down here. Nobody you you management fees are always a percentage of of income. Percentage of revenue, etcetera. You can input your taxes and insurance, but you can see we can all get all the way down to the total operating expense I skip by it. You've got your gross operating profit calculation. And then we go below that to get your total expense, your EBITDA, Reserve for replacement, you know, we can calculate here, maybe 3% and it will populate the information over here to calculate your net operating income. It's my understanding that very few, if any of the other tools out there today actually get down to the NOI.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:06.016Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:06.595Z)

My understanding that most of them will stop at the gross operating perf. So, like, hot stat? And what's Cynthia screen? And just launched with her new profit. Plan. Right? There. Focus. On being expense

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:19.186Z)

So, like, hot stats and what Cindy has just launched with her new profit platform. Right? They're really focused

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:19.785Z)

compare. And we will have that too. That's a big part our strat because you know, Charlotte the workflow automation

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:26.786Z)

on being expense comparables, and we will have that

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:28.395Z)

is there. Important. Because it's gonna save people time.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:31.096Z)

too. That's a big part of our strategy because

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:31.155Z)

But the end, day, the it's the amount mindset.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:34.386Z)

you know, Howard the workflow automation is very

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:34.475Z)

Data aggregation that is going to help the industry as well.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:37.886Z)

because it's gonna save people time. But at the end of the day, it's

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:38.605Z)

Right? We see that as the other tools out

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:41.416Z)

the it's the anonymized data aggregation that is is going to help the industry

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:41.535Z)

there. Are are their coming up. From the hotel. Other operations perspective.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:46.266Z)

as well. Right? We just see it as the other tools out there

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:46.595Z)

We're coming at this direct from the capital markets perspective, right? We need

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:50.786Z)

are are they're more coming up from the hotel operations per

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:51.065Z)

NOI. Because you value by cap or

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:54.496Z)

and we're coming at this directly from the capital markets

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:54.715Z)

running. A DCF. On NOI. And then on

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:14:58.086Z)

perspective. Right? We need NOI because you value by capping

### You (2025-07-09T18:14:58.865Z)

the proof of concept, part of where we stand. It is where it

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:02.786Z)

or running a DCF on NOI.

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:02.865Z)

is unique. Position. Where all of this is residing on Howard. Computer. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:06.536Z)

And then on the proof of concept, part of where we stand is

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:06.705Z)

Now. And that's step is for us to turn it over to our software engineer.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:10.966Z)

we're in this unique position where all of this is residing on Howard's computer right now.

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:11.495Z)

Who pull it up into the cloud. And then kind of tapping out.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:15.936Z)

And the next step is for us to turn it over to our software engineer who will pull it up into the cloud and then

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:16.245Z)

What we can do on an on an individual computer. Right. Then that step is we really do need to get it. It up and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:23.326Z)

we're kind of tapping out at what we can do on an on an individual

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:24.015Z)

class. Starting to to get it. It. So column. The soft

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:27.786Z)

with this. Right? And so the next step is we really do need to get

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:27.835Z)

coding. Actually. Is that is that how I would say that? Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:31.946Z)

it up in the cloud and start to get

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:32.225Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:34.016Z)

the, how would what would you call it? The software coding actually written

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:34.895Z)

which which wouldn't take very long because this is

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:38.386Z)

that is that how you would say it? Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:39.265Z)

being coated in the background, but it's not something that you would release at an enterprise level. Works great on my laptop, but we wouldn't be able to have, you know, 50 people logged into my laptop and working on it. So Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So so yeah. Will. Well, the MVP, yeah, it'll be Yeah. Limited.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:15:58.566Z)

Today,

### You (2025-07-09T18:15:59.965Z)

So that we need to take it from my laptop put it into an enterprise database Azure

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:03.096Z)

to yeah. In a year from now, we we will. And,

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:05.335Z)

Amazon, Google, whatever web

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:07.306Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:07.665Z)

we use. That way everybody can authenticate get in, underwrite, etcetera. And then find yeah, ahead. It. Is that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:20.996Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:22.455Z)

this is purpose built. For hotel investors.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:24.626Z)

And and one other thing, Kara, is that, like, one of the reasons we're starting to socialize is

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:25.935Z)

And so you can imagine got it. Now you've got

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:29.476Z)

so early is this is purpose built for hotel investors.

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:29.565Z)

me. You've got Drew. You've got Mark. You're like, telling. You know, you know.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:34.446Z)

And so you can imagine you've got you've got me. You've got Drew. You've got Mark. Right?

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:39.805Z)

They user that we're selling

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:41.416Z)

And we're, like, telling, you know, and Howard, all these things. But, really,

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:41.555Z)

it to, the we're building with the with the type. With how big one.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:45.206Z)

we we're thinking about it the way we would do it, but we wanna make sure that the users that we're

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:45.345Z)

Model is. And so it's really important. For us to get out there get first early.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:49.726Z)

selling it to, that we're building it with the with the type with how they wanna model it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:49.795Z)

Feedback. From each. And from you know, front.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:54.696Z)

And so it's really important for us to get out there and get early feedback from

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:55.375Z)

Or So for different that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:16:59.666Z)

analysts and from, you know, private

### You (2025-07-09T18:16:59.935Z)

we build it. Exactly way they want it. Not the way. We

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:03.526Z)

debt firms and from banks. Do you know what I'm saying? So that, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:17:03.575Z)

think. They want it. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:07.986Z)

we like, we build it exactly the way they want it, not the way we think they want it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:17:08.345Z)

And and then the last thing to show here is we we didn't stop at the NOI. So we've actually got

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:12.836Z)

It. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:17:13.875Z)

the capital expenditures in here as well. So we can track, you know, if I wanna add a new roof next year, know, I could go through and add the new roof. I can select what what group it is. And it might be $123,456 in year one and then something, you know, year two. CapEx. And whatever. Right? So you can go through here. Maybe I'm gonna upgrade the meeting space in

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:42.936Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:17:43.765Z)

next year. A couple years from now. So and and then same thing just like I showed you before, you know, I can just keep adding additional line items. So that I can get my full CapEx project

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:53.986Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:17:56.295Z)

there. Which obviously for the lenders and for the underwriting people that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:17:59.986Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:18:01.835Z)

they're going to want to know what the plans are, etc. So one one thing that I wanna make make clear as well that, you know, kinda going back before my tech

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:18:13.166Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:18:13.615Z)

days back as an asset manager, I was responsible for the deal from Cradle to Grave. From the acquisition through the disposition and we are also designing this tool with the asset manager in mind This isn't just an underwriting tool. Right? It's not just come up with an evaluation, we want this to be something that they can use throughout the entire life cycle.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:18:37.556Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:18:38.285Z)

We do have additional features in mind and we'll be building that out as well But This is where we stand today as the proof of concept Of course gonna have reports. I've got one here that know, I can click on the occupancy report, and then based on the occupancy that I input into the model, it'll show you your historical and then forecasting out.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:18:57.386Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:19:01.505Z)

One of the things that we do plan on doing, and as early as is to provide users the ability to create a investment package. You can go to an investment committee or that you can send out to lenders, etcetera. So everything that I'm gonna show you here today, you'll be able to print out and we expect to a list of different reports here so that the user can just go and check the boxes and then click a button to print the package and you'd have a PDF that includes everything that you want there. Summary page you can see is still under construction, but that would be part it too. This is really going be you know, the dashboard. Where you're going to have, you know, maybe three you know, six little widgets with different graphs, you know, the highlighting, the KPIs,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:19:51.986Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:19:54.125Z)

probably the same thing as what we show

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:19:54.266Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:19:56.125Z)

in these cards up here, you know, you'll have the graphs there. Last here is, I'm hoping by hopefully maybe by the end of Friday

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:20:06.406Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:20:07.915Z)

we'll have the documents section. As I mentioned before this will just be a a typical drag and drop. You can upload any documents. That are associated with the deal. Keep everything in one place, and then also you know, we're you're gonna buy a property, you're also gonna sell it, you want to and this is a very, important part of the underwriting itself. So we'll have the disposition waterfall So that not only will we have you know, our exit assumptions up here, we're also going to be including the distributions and everything else down to the last detail, Again, for that. Cradle to grave and for that initial underwriting evaluation. Tool here. So If if we log in deal path Right? Correct? On it. And I don't wanna say we're copying deal pack because we'll we played that with API and a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:01.946Z)

And and we love deal path. Right? We're

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:02.145Z)

integration with deal partners. But so that like, buying a black stone.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:06.526Z)

and and I don't wanna say we're copying deal path because we'll we plan to have an

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:06.565Z)

Or Brookfield and I using. One. Good deal. Cloud.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:10.086Z)

API integration with deal path. But so that, like, if I'm a black or Brookfield and I'm using one of DealCloud or DealPath,

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:10.155Z)

Deal path that I can still pull my hotels up with all my other asset class right and see it all. Together. But problem deal path is it's just not configured for hospitality.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:19.456Z)

I can still pull my hotels up with all my other assets

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:21.535Z)

So it seems like a lot of

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:22.476Z)

classes, right, and see it all together. But the problem with deal path is it's

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:23.525Z)

deeper than the the big institutional shot

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:27.176Z)

just not configured for hospitality.

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:27.555Z)

that want to have everything together can have it together.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:30.196Z)

This is, like, a level deeper that

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:30.775Z)

But then have a tool that's more specific to hospitality.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:33.496Z)

the the big institutional shops that want

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:34.825Z)

And the c we we go

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:36.876Z)

to have everything together can have it all together, but then have a

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:36.935Z)

all the CEO. DealPath. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:40.196Z)

tool that's more specific to hospitality.

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:41.645Z)

he says you know, behind

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:43.916Z)

And the c we we love we follow the CEO of Dego Path on a lot of the things he does. And he says, nirvana

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:44.155Z)

for calling. For an institutional shot. Is to be to see of your existing portfolio and overlay

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:51.906Z)

for an owner or I'll call it for an institutional shop.

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:52.175Z)

not top up that. Your pipeline. What you're looking what you're looking at

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:56.186Z)

Is to be able to see all of your existing portfolio,

### You (2025-07-09T18:21:56.445Z)

the market. Sure. Right? And then also getting

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:21:59.926Z)

and then overlaid on top of that all of your pipeline.

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:00.375Z)

much more advanced in what they're doing as

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:03.036Z)

What you're looking what you're looking at in the market. Right?

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:03.305Z)

far as pooling. Legal back. In. Closing doc document. You know, we're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:07.396Z)

And they're also getting much more advanced in what they're doing as

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:08.055Z)

looking at part in this will be the attorney in here that comes out. And I'm I'm

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:12.066Z)

far as pulling legal documents in, closing documents,

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:12.495Z)

in part of really. Focused on this. You know, over the next twelve months.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:15.956Z)

You know, we're looking at part, and this will be the attorney in you that comes out, and

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:16.445Z)

It's starting be able to pull turf sheet. Right? And and it might summarize.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:20.656Z)

I'm I'm

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:20.955Z)

Term sheet.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:21.436Z)

Howard and I are very focused on this, you know, over the next twelve months.

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:21.545Z)

Very quickly. To pull a joint venture, great agreements and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:25.116Z)

Is starting to be able to pull in term sheets. Right? And and, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:25.455Z)

loan agreements. And manage management agreement. And then the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:29.186Z)

summarize term sheets very quickly to pull in

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:29.395Z)

essentially I was just following the yellow brick road of what's already happening in commercial real estate.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:32.436Z)

joint venture agreements and loan agreements and management agreements. And

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:34.905Z)

But hospitality is an entire

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:37.166Z)

I mean, we're essentially I was just following the yellow brick

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:37.205Z)

decade. Behind. So we don't have a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:40.186Z)

road of what's already happening in commercial real estate

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:40.245Z)

tools like this and other do, but it's gonna take people

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:43.536Z)

but hospitality is an entire decade behind.

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:44.095Z)

that know, hospitality build this for hospitals. Hospitality. And

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:47.846Z)

So we don't have any tools like this, and others do.

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:48.005Z)

so kinda like the attorney you. And the lender you,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:51.346Z)

But it's gonna take people that know hospitality to build this for

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:51.845Z)

like, that that you you walk as will be your command central and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:55.776Z)

And so

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:55.945Z)

all. Of your deal. And your existing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:22:57.586Z)

kinda like the attorney in you and the lender in you, like, that that

### You (2025-07-09T18:22:58.985Z)

loans, you know, what you're negotiating all of that.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:01.746Z)

you you will have this will be your command central, and all

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:02.825Z)

Be here. Including

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:05.066Z)

of your deals and your, you know, your existing loans

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:05.145Z)

you know, do plan to try pull in?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:08.086Z)

you know, what you're negotiating, all of that.

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:08.855Z)

Is a future thing. But, you know, all closing.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:11.256Z)

Will be here, including

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:11.575Z)

Time. Too. Right? Which now sit on someone's server.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:14.246Z)

you know, we do plan to try to pull in this is a future thing, but, again, all the

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:15.035Z)

And you're always going to access those. Right? I need the final executed version of the loan document so I can check something.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:19.216Z)

all of the closing docs too, right, which now sit on someone's

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:21.785Z)

And so now the idea that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:23.256Z)

server and you're always going to access those. Right? I need the

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:23.825Z)

that seek some to

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:26.516Z)

final executed version of the loan document so I can check something.

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:26.615Z)

find So I I do need to let you know that we're fair focused on security at

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:30.856Z)

And so now the idea is that

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:31.055Z)

well, and that's in our roadmap. Because

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:33.876Z)

well, we will seek SOC two compliance. So I I do need to let you know that we're very focused

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:33.955Z)

deal path has SOC two compliant. Procore has it. But that that's division is like you're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:38.546Z)

on security as well, and that's in our road map.

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:39.845Z)

you're not 20 through your for every

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:42.076Z)

Because deal path has SOC two compliance and Procore has it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:42.335Z)

single thing. It all sits here on your command central. And

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:45.906Z)

But that, I mean, that's the vision is, like, you're, you know, you're not hunting through your network

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:46.725Z)

it is allows you to to you know, do four deal. At the time it would take you to do

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:50.696Z)

for every single thing. It all sits here on your command central and

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:52.035Z)

one deal. I'm thinking about that metric, but Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:55.426Z)

it allows you to

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:55.845Z)

And, Cara, Diane just made a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:23:57.356Z)

to, you know, do four deals in the time it would take

### You (2025-07-09T18:23:58.395Z)

a good point here. I just wanna make sure that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:24:00.376Z)

you to do one deal. I'm making up that metric, but I just yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:24:01.255Z)

you want that to clarify that what I just showed you is just at an individual deal. Level. My my colleague is working on the actual InnVest website which would then when a client logs in, they'll see their entire pipeline. They'll have a list of all the deals they've got whether they're closed, whether they're currently in progress. If you want to see a roll up if you're buying three or four deals in an area, can check those and see the the full aggregated results of those. And we're also very much interested in moving forward with the marketplace which is something that we were in the process of doing at Red IQ. Which essentially would be connecting Invest AI broker clients with InnVestAI investor clients, So a broker would go through and do what I just did. They'll go through and they'll create the deal in their in their account use it to come up with the valuation for their OM. They can put together a package but then what they can do is

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:25:15.236Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:25:15.885Z)

is what we had in RedIQ which is just deal sharing. So they can input the email or they can share it with with another investor. And that investor does not have to go through and do everything from the very beginning. They're gonna get a completed package and they just need to tweak. Some of their assumptions. They may have a little bit of different financing. They may have different exit strategies. Different hold period So in that way, you know, it would benefit the brokers because as they share it with other clients, you know, that's a that's a another another name for their client list. Or protect your prospect list, then of course saves the investors a tremendous amount of time So not only are we in a position to greatly the amount of time it takes to assess a deal. And underwrite it. But also from the time that goes that is listed to the time that they start getting bids and offers could be reduced from weeks to days, or theoretically even hours. So that's really one of the the the huge benefits of this type of tool. Excellent. Okay. So I have this some thoughts on you

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:26:39.006Z)

Excellent.

### You (2025-07-09T18:26:40.295Z)

is there more that you'd like to share? Should I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:26:42.956Z)

Okay. So

### You (2025-07-09T18:26:44.525Z)

jump in? Yeah. That'd be awesome, Carol. Thank you. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:26:46.386Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:26:48.175Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:26:50.316Z)

I will say

### You (2025-07-09T18:27:22.745Z)

And then I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:27:24.286Z)

one of the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:27:33.606Z)

I started going a little bit farther. I actually had a conversation

### You (2025-07-09T18:27:35.195Z)

It was like, I'm just going into it going like this is really hard to try to buy a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:27:38.276Z)

I don't recall specifically what it was, but

kind of

### You (2025-07-09T18:27:51.895Z)

in this.

Got this struggling.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:00.266Z)

lack of fit in this role that we were discussing or whatever. And I literally went on AI, and I'm like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:01.605Z)

Idea that I don't wanna get up, you know, I just like, just bring.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:05.526Z)

that attended. Were I learned how to upload.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:25.586Z)

that was pretty awesome. And I I went

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:25.835Z)

Different So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:28.936Z)

took a couple classes at a

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:29.025Z)

in a lot of ways, my

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:31.636Z)

conference that I attended where I learned how to, like, upload

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:32.115Z)

regretting. AI.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:35.516Z)

different presentations and

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:35.565Z)

And say first time I've really breathe.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:37.766Z)

so

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:38.775Z)

Technology

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:39.086Z)

in a lot of ways, I am despite my dinosaur brain,

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:40.165Z)

as a tool. In real estate. Because I do

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:42.336Z)

I am

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:42.975Z)

I always

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:43.376Z)

embracing AI. And it's I would say the first time I've really embraced

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:44.055Z)

joke. Every deal. Is a snowflake. You know. Just every

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:48.136Z)

technology as a tool in real estate because I do

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:48.325Z)

know, he's sick. You see that. Send them the text. Thing. You get a feeling really, I'm not into that.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:53.066Z)

always joke every deal is a snowflake.

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:53.785Z)

You know? And I kinda

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:55.986Z)

You know? You just every you know, you think you see patterns,

### You (2025-07-09T18:28:56.495Z)

doubt it. That I had

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:28:59.546Z)

then the next thing you get a deal, and you're like, oh, that doesn't fit into that

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:00.375Z)

So I will say, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:03.646Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:04.475Z)

the direct you're going

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:05.276Z)

kinda

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:05.705Z)

with the number. Of things and other

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:06.176Z)

data

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:06.815Z)

things that written.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:07.366Z)

I don't know, interface that I had in mind. So Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:07.615Z)

Down. That you have addressed. Any deeper. In the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:11.966Z)

I will say, like, the the direction you're going with the number

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:12.515Z)

it somewhat some type you'll look

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:15.556Z)

things. Another thing that I had written down that you

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:15.825Z)

at it. You know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:18.896Z)

kind of addressed, but I wanna go a little deeper on, is the idea that something like

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:18.915Z)

beverage on it. Per available room sometimes you wanna hard code it. Sometimes

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:22.926Z)

sometimes you'll look at

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:23.735Z)

percent. Of revenue. Right? Like, depends on

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:26.916Z)

you know, food and beverage on a per available room. Sometimes you wanna

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:27.035Z)

you're looking at it. We kinda have set. It definitely will say person

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:31.436Z)

hard code it. Sometimes it's percent of revenue. Right? Like, you

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:31.795Z)

different approach. On the deal. One thing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:35.506Z)

depends on how you're looking at it and the kinda asset and

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:36.205Z)

we do in debt which I think it

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:38.556Z)

and it like, I will same person, different approach based on the deal.

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:38.625Z)

people don't do, as much. Of it. An It is that solving.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:43.136Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:43.445Z)

So we will literally

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:44.756Z)

Mhmm. One thing that we do in debt

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:44.805Z)

go okay. Let's assume

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:46.906Z)

which I think it people don't do as much of an equity

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:47.425Z)

that cow race

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:50.856Z)

is

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:51.155Z)

sting same.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:51.806Z)

back solving. So we will literally go, okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:52.005Z)

And we are this

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:55.306Z)

Let's assume

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:55.845Z)

is not just

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:57.116Z)

that

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:57.975Z)

we foreclose

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:29:57.986Z)

cap rates stay the same

### You (2025-07-09T18:29:59.295Z)

and it. Cost basis, so in other words, like, the vendor run our loan.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:02.466Z)

and we are this asset is in distress.

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:03.315Z)

And let's assume that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:06.766Z)

And we foreclose

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:07.625Z)

months. Our far.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:08.756Z)

and our cost basis. So in other words, like, we've underwritten our loan.

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:08.985Z)

Doesn't. Pay. The their payment. So our balance

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:13.316Z)

And let's assume that our

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:13.645Z)

from 10,000,000 to you know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:16.326Z)

for six months, our borrower doesn't pay

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:16.915Z)

10,000,800 and And and we can

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:19.716Z)

their their payments. So our balance has gone up from 10,000,000 to

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:21.705Z)

and we have right are. Worth it. For. When we bought it.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:25.406Z)

you know, 10,000,800. And we foreclose

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:26.215Z)

So so percent. What like, you know, when I to be?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:31.176Z)

and cap rates are where they were when we

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:32.005Z)

Find it.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:35.036Z)

bought in. So seven and a half percent

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:36.085Z)

Right. To get to that. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:38.226Z)

What does my NOI have to be? And if my NOI is

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:38.735Z)

price. What that mean has happened like? To our

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:43.166Z)

whatever the number is,

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:43.725Z)

top line? Right.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:45.816Z)

right, to get to that

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:46.475Z)

So that we have a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:47.376Z)

sale price. What does that mean has happened, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:50.675Z)

because right, here.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:52.486Z)

to our top line?

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:53.115Z)

So summer

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:54.116Z)

Right? So

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:54.485Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:30:56.936Z)

then we have to kind of fidget with our expenses because

### You (2025-07-09T18:30:59.645Z)

apart. Check on what you

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:00.976Z)

right? You got Mhmm. Some are fixed, some are not.

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:03.125Z)

RevPAR?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:04.566Z)

Then you kinda back solved what your

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:05.885Z)

Client. System.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:06.756Z)

RevPAR has to be, and then maybe you take a little bit of a gut check on what you think the

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:10.405Z)

That's

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:11.156Z)

contributing factors to that RevPAR would be. Like Mhmm. We are seeing new supply. It's just

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:14.425Z)

see like And

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:16.126Z)

gonna be

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:16.975Z)

we're gonna get

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:17.266Z)

know, we're not gonna be able to get

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:17.615Z)

tested. Again. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:19.116Z)

occupancy, and we're gonna have to compete on rate. Or

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:22.375Z)

Right? And we're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:23.266Z)

we see is, like, the more more vulnerable.

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:24.005Z)

still gonna get home. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:26.156Z)

Then we kinda gut test it and go, okay. So we can see this

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:27.275Z)

About that. No

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:29.326Z)

kinda decline in occupancy, this kinda decline in rate,

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:31.405Z)

Sorry. One sec.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:32.886Z)

and we're still gonna get out whole.

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:33.725Z)

One thing that would help

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:34.966Z)

Okay. I feel pretty good about that. Or, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:36.505Z)

desk.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:38.286Z)

does not leave a lot of room for error.

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:38.585Z)

It

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:40.426Z)

Right? Mhmm. So I will say one thing

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:42.385Z)

functionality.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:44.606Z)

that would help in the debt space is

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:47.585Z)

Spike. Nothing.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:48.466Z)

if there is a way to add that kind of back

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:48.605Z)

Full cheating. Death. Really. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:51.486Z)

solving functionality, which I think in equity is almost

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:51.505Z)

Cheating. We're out. Slowly. Solving. See. Great.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:54.966Z)

they're loathe to do it. It's it's almost like no. That's

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:56.045Z)

Tip right now.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:31:58.196Z)

full cheating. In debt, we're like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:31:59.505Z)

Correct.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:00.126Z)

yeah. That's cheating. We're absolutely back solving to see. Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:03.095Z)

Yeah. You're truly doing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:04.766Z)

You know, getting to these numbers.

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:05.455Z)

right. You're doing.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:06.926Z)

You're testing the downside. Right? You're you're testing the

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:07.785Z)

I don't think people in equity. Do.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:11.086Z)

testing the downside. Yeah. And you're you're truly doing, like you're doing a back solve, which I don't think people in equity do

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:17.505Z)

Beat them? Rep? Party? And actually are?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:19.596Z)

nearly as often. I mean, maybe a little, but really they

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:20.005Z)

Expensive? For them. Expected. Solve

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:23.876Z)

tend to look at it more like, what happens if we

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:24.385Z)

for their stress.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:26.726Z)

if we beat up RevPar and and actually our

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:26.865Z)

Way. We send it back some? Our distress scenarios

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:29.746Z)

expenses go up more than expected, and then they kind of

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:30.905Z)

Yeah. So I've been one one of the things let me let me address that real quick is

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:33.266Z)

solve for their distress scenarios that way.

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:36.015Z)

we do have a road map

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:37.706Z)

We tend to backsolve our distress scenarios

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:38.375Z)

where we have a risk matrix

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:40.556Z)

Mhmm. More.

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:40.905Z)

that we plan on implementing. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:32:41.566Z)

I think.

### You (2025-07-09T18:32:43.665Z)

when we come up with a value right? It'll say our cap rate's 5% and then here in interest rate is here, but it's it's very simple to create a matrix. So, you know, what happens if my cap rate goes down or cap rate goes up or interest rates go down So you can kind of take a look there. And create basically a heat map so you can instantly see where do I get to that zero or negative number where's my positive number is very easy to do. But another thing that we can do and again, I I'm an AI fanboy. I've been using every single tool that's come out since November of twenty twenty three, and and I I very, very familiar with the risks as well. Everybody will tell you, you know, they'll talk about hallucinations, or, you know, the the data that you've got available ends last August, and we don't have enough And that's all true. But everybody also agrees that when it comes to numbers, AI does a really really good job You can upload a financial statement and get all sorts of graphs and charts and calculations and everything else. So one of the early things that we really would like to implement is exactly what you're discussing here. You could just literally get in there and say, what would happen if or how do I get this number two and input it And it can go through the model, and they can give you all the different options. Okay, well if you want to get to this particular IIR then you have to make these changes.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:20.796Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:21.095Z)

You know, and it might give you a list of them. Right. Yeah. We're we would definitely have that on the radar. Thinking about it. A little from more

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:29.676Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:30.375Z)

because I come from there. Actual the house I was from the equity space.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:33.426Z)

But, Carrie, that is

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:34.285Z)

Right? So you I I what you're saying. It's like a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:37.266Z)

I think we have been thinking about it a little from more because I come from the

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:38.475Z)

it's same thing that Howard said. It's just that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:41.456Z)

act well, Howard and I both come from the equity space. Right?

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:41.655Z)

all being even a little bit more because you're back solving that now. For

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:44.746Z)

So you I understand what you're saying, though. It's like an

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:45.135Z)

can I get out of this loan?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:48.066Z)

it's the same thing that Howard just said. It's just back

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:48.715Z)

It x y z. I have them with how so much.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:51.356Z)

solving even a little bit more because you're back solving now for

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:51.895Z)

Will room doing. Have? To be able to access this?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:34:55.126Z)

can I get out of this loan, right, if x, y, and z

### You (2025-07-09T18:34:55.185Z)

Loan. Yeah. And is that something that like, that's what my my team.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:00.006Z)

happens, how how much wiggle room do I have to be able to

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:00.175Z)

My can make sure we can search about? Or does it we feel confident? That that's

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:04.196Z)

out of this loan? And and is that something that

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:04.375Z)

enough? Coverage to to get us on. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:08.206Z)

my invest my my team, my investment committee should be concerned about, or does it get

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:09.625Z)

And we feel like mostly back solved.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:12.676Z)

we feel comfortable that that's enough coverage to

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:12.775Z)

Shamelessness is not there on the equity side. That's No. No. It's not. You know what about

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:16.176Z)

to get us by. Right?

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:17.735Z)

thinking about too, and I think the equity side, they

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:18.876Z)

And we do seamlessly back solve. And I feel like that

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:20.415Z)

really. Need. Pause. On it. But I do think it's needed, and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:22.586Z)

shamelessness is not there on the equity side as much. No. No.

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:24.025Z)

fact that it is exists operators forecast.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:26.086Z)

But you know what about other things I've been thinking about too? And I think the equity side may really

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:28.885Z)

And operators are created

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:31.056Z)

pause on this, but I do think it's needed. And the fact that it exists is

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:31.075Z)

forward three months forecast. Right? It's very, very important measure. To them.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:36.016Z)

operators have forecasts, and

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:36.285Z)

They have to be able within like, nine five six Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:39.366Z)

operators are graded on forward three months forecast.

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:39.885Z)

No. You can all further, it doesn't really

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:42.776Z)

Right? It's a very important measure to them.

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:43.215Z)

hard for me. Year. The back half. Of the year doesn't it gets

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:46.246Z)

They have to be within, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:46.475Z)

scrubbed until really. July or August when there's

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:48.546Z)

95, 96. Right? Now when you get out further,

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:49.375Z)

starting to budget. But I were let

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:52.356Z)

it doesn't really as you march through the year, the back

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:52.505Z)

I I'm want them, three forward. Forecast. Remember? And the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:35:55.586Z)

half of the year doesn't get scrubbed until really July or August when they're starting to

### You (2025-07-09T18:35:56.705Z)

in the of, like, oh, this go Like, I see I'm almost

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:00.556Z)

budget.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:00.995Z)

for a few months.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:01.446Z)

If I were a lender, I might want that three month forward forecast.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:01.805Z)

Is this a trend or am I gonna see this in the next couple of months? Now the equity guide

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:06.266Z)

Right? As a indicator of, like, oh, is this

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:07.465Z)

will hate that. Right? Because they won't

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:09.476Z)

going? Like, I see I'm off for a few months. Is this a

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:09.655Z)

wanna share that. That, by the way. Yeah. The group

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:13.066Z)

trend, or am I gonna see this in the next couple of months?

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:13.175Z)

will hate. That. I think there. They're like, it really could

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:16.866Z)

Now the equity guys will hate that, right, because they won't wanna

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:17.915Z)

be. Shared. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:20.546Z)

share that. Will hate that, by the way.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:21.045Z)

Yeah. Well,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:22.806Z)

Yeah. The brokers will hate that. But the the the data's there.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:22.975Z)

that be very helpful. Like, I said, as

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:27.086Z)

Right? It really could be shared. So yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:31.925Z)

a little, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:31.986Z)

Yeah. Well, that that would be very helpful. And, like, as a

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:32.995Z)

our client was really she was in

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:36.176Z)

as a broker I mean, I can think of one instance in particular where it was, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:36.835Z)

the lender. Based. On best rate. And most dollars to the penny.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:40.636Z)

every time we lined up a lender,

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:41.355Z)

And unfortunately, this is asset was just on a slow

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:44.066Z)

our client was really

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:44.735Z)

creek. Downward. And if he

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:46.096Z)

choosing the lender based on best rate and

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:47.395Z)

been, a little bit more open to the idea

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:36:49.806Z)

and most dollars to the penny. Mhmm. And, unfortunately, this asset was just on a slow creep downward. If he had been a little bit more open to the idea of going with a slightly more expensive or lower proceeds lender than there would have been some room.

### You (2025-07-09T18:36:51.005Z)

going a slight more expensive board. Lower. Proceeds lender and some So we ended up having to, like, restart because each lender would go. To two months in the diligence would go It doesn't work for us anymore. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:08.046Z)

So we ended up having to, like, restart because each lender would go

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:09.505Z)

having that forward three, I'm under would love it.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:12.506Z)

two two months into diligence would go, this doesn't work for us anymore. And I was like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:12.795Z)

And you're my hate it. You're right. You

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:17.356Z)

oh my god. So

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:17.725Z)

the way you're explaining it. It could help them navigate

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:19.706Z)

having that forward three, I mean, lenders would love it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:21.695Z)

their own into the rent. Loan versus

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:23.536Z)

And

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:24.325Z)

loan.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:24.836Z)

you're right. Hate it. You're right. But then but in a way, like, the way you're explaining it,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:24.905Z)

Deal. Right? That means need. Something to it. That could be helpful tool because let's not

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:29.806Z)

if it could help them navigate their

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:30.355Z)

having been on the owner side and finding out strike.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:32.946Z)

owner into the right loan versus blow up a deal,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:34.235Z)

You Look. They're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:36.056Z)

right, then maybe there's something to it that it could be a helpful tool. Because

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:37.095Z)

is. The senior person in in in that has disbelief.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:40.456Z)

I'll tell you, having been on the owner side and financed, right,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:41.875Z)

That could go down and further right. And then you've got the asset

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:44.066Z)

you'd like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:44.665Z)

in. There. Saying, what

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:47.236Z)

there is the senior person in in investment company that has disbelief that you could go down any

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:52.645Z)

a bunch of different something like that. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:53.756Z)

Right? And then you've got the asset manager sitting there saying,

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:54.555Z)

Sometimes they're Where you actually have debt

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:37:56.866Z)

well, we might actually still

### You (2025-07-09T18:37:57.645Z)

educate the whole senior person to your

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:00.246Z)

by a couple, you know, by because we backloaded the

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:00.455Z)

to the back. That there is wreck. That it's not

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:03.536Z)

budget or something like that. And they should sometimes they're completed.

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:03.655Z)

right. Yeah. So that goes around. All really great.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:06.496Z)

Where you actually have to educate the most senior person too

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:06.785Z)

Point. It's interesting. Okay. Here's another thing I said maybe some

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:11.196Z)

to the fact that there is risk, that it's not Right. Right. Yep. So that those are all really great points. It's interesting. Okay. Here's another thing, and this is

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:19.765Z)

what thing is that as an example,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:22.076Z)

maybe too

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:24.125Z)

it's only thing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:25.006Z)

much of a

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:25.895Z)

space. You know.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:27.316Z)

kind of

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:27.905Z)

Be ex

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:28.336Z)

pie in the sky. But one thing is

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:29.045Z)

people. Are. On hotels. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:32.186Z)

as an example,

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:32.945Z)

what the concern that I have

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:35.876Z)

in the lending

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:36.065Z)

in an automated system

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:37.396Z)

space, you know, we're not we're not the experts of the equity people are on hotels.

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:38.445Z)

It that you You're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:42.246Z)

So one of the concerns that I have an automated system is that

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:49.195Z)

You know, trying to get the down.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:50.966Z)

don't

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:51.395Z)

That looks great. Gives all the answers

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:53.456Z)

your

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:54.075Z)

It's not as necessarily taking the time to

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:38:55.756Z)

the the person on the deal who's under time pressure and trying to underwrite as many as

### You (2025-07-09T18:38:56.935Z)

come out. And digest. And process, and one of the things that sometimes happens

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:00.486Z)

and, you know, trying to get the dashboard that looks great and gives all the answers.

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:01.345Z)

is a super simplified. You go

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:05.826Z)

Is not necessarily taking the time to, like, take a moment, digest

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:06.715Z)

okay. It's just so that know, we're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:09.656Z)

and process. And one of the things that sometimes happens, and this

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:10.205Z)

using it. Slower. Growth. Rate. Your rent.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:13.246Z)

is a super simplified

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:14.205Z)

Then do that. And then they

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:16.096Z)

one. But, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:16.215Z)

forget to adjust at the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:17.676Z)

you go, okay. Adjust it so that, you know, we're you see a

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:18.505Z)

b or they forget. And I know you got, like, percentage in there. But some

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:22.646Z)

slower growth rate on your RevPAR. And then they do that,

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:23.465Z)

percentages are not. The dominant. One. One. We're like Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:27.336Z)

then they forget to adjust

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:27.525Z)

So, like, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:29.406Z)

f and b or they forget. And I know you've got, like, the percentages in there.

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:29.525Z)

you're it's ratio. When you're top line. You know, decline.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:34.256Z)

But sometimes the percentages are not

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:34.335Z)

By percent. Year

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:36.566Z)

They're not a one to one relationship. Right? So, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:36.875Z)

over March. Are not static. Right here.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:40.506Z)

you know, your expense ratios when your top line

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:41.355Z)

Sometimes, been expenses

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:44.416Z)

you know, declines

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:44.485Z)

but even not fixed

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:46.516Z)

by 5%, your margins are not static. Right? Your

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:46.765Z)

expense is. The expenses are not they don't it they don't

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:51.006Z)

margins are gonna decrease.

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:52.045Z)

in one year. Way.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:53.286Z)

Sometimes I mean, obviously, there's fixed expenses, but even in the non

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:53.395Z)

With the top rate. Are there any, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:57.686Z)

expenses,

### You (2025-07-09T18:39:57.715Z)

yeah. Things are, like for that? I'm looking at

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:39:59.456Z)

those expenses are not they don't

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:00.035Z)

that. Side,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:02.016Z)

it they don't decline in a linear way with the

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:03.015Z)

look at flow through. Flex. Right? Right.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:05.976Z)

top line. Right? Are there any, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:08.505Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:09.506Z)

flags or, like for that. Look at this.

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:10.905Z)

fluid. Members. GOP.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:12.716Z)

The operating side, we look at flow through and flex.

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:13.815Z)

Line. Help you here. In the right direction.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:16.906Z)

Right? That is, like, when if you're going up or down by even a little bit or a lot,

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:17.845Z)

So more data we click, the more deals that go through our system. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:21.756Z)

there are flow and flex measures at the GOP p line that tell you if you're moving in the right direction.

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:22.855Z)

We're lucky and we're able to keep deals in the system from, like, lender tracking in and around. And awarding.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:29.656Z)

So the more data we collect, the more deals that go through our system, right,

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:29.825Z)

Know? We collect we able to track all those flex

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:34.266Z)

And if we're lucky and we're able to keep deals in the system,

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:34.525Z)

and flow. And essentially, almost flat

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:37.366Z)

from, like, lenders tracking it or asset managers, and the more data we

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:37.455Z)

it. It's makes sense. Right? If your account has or

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:42.336Z)

collect, we will be able to track

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:43.245Z)

less say the Yeah. Let's say that lower.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:45.456Z)

all those flex and flows and essentially almost

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:45.975Z)

Revenue. Right? But they haven't really accounted

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:48.806Z)

flag it if this makes sense. Right? If your analyst has

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:48.855Z)

for it. That the property can't look. Well. As as

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:53.146Z)

lowered or or let's just say they've

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:53.205Z)

they put there. That's the roof. Margin. Can be high.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:40:56.226Z)

yeah, let's say they've lowered revenue. Right? But they haven't really

### You (2025-07-09T18:40:56.735Z)

So I believe that we can see it. June. GOP level for someone to, like, be

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:00.176Z)

accounted for the fact that the property can't flex as well as

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:01.095Z)

best in class. Offering metrics. Set them

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:04.646Z)

as they put in there, that the rooms margin can't be as high.

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:05.005Z)

up in and in a in a that you know, under right

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:08.506Z)

So I believe that we can actually, at the GOP level, pull some of the, like, the best

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:09.035Z)

flat. You wanted. If that flexor flow

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:13.296Z)

in class operating metrics and set them up

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:13.665Z)

looks out. Market. Does that make sense?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:17.126Z)

and and in a in a way that your underwriting can get

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:18.265Z)

Love that. So I am I've left firmly believe

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:20.866Z)

flagged if you want it if that flex or flow metric looks

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:21.175Z)

that we all hold are bound a lot of competing. You know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:25.836Z)

out of market. Does that make sense? It does, and I love that. Yes.

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:27.825Z)

Well, yeah. Without the help.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:30.956Z)

So I am I'm a firm believer that we all

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:31.585Z)

Something like that. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:34.126Z)

are balancing a lot of competing

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:34.155Z)

Just creates a place that you don't have to spend three times amount.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:37.736Z)

you know, demands. And

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:37.755Z)

The amount of time fit Right. With your efficiency as

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:40.156Z)

even the best of us will Yeah. Zone out on something like that. And

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:41.565Z)

often times like, even using. The efficiency for me

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:45.126Z)

you know, it just

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:45.415Z)

is not the is making your

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:46.556Z)

creates a mess that you then have to spend three times amount the amount of time to fix.

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:47.695Z)

It's like when I read it's answer, I'm like, oh. Yeah. Oops. Forgot about that.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:51.136Z)

Right. So the efficiency is oftentimes like, even using AI,

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:52.575Z)

Right now. Right. Yeah. And I'm so we have

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:55.836Z)

the efficiency for me is not that it gives me the answer.

### You (2025-07-09T18:41:55.845Z)

the data. To do that. Right? And so that's part of our goal, the more deals that get underwritten and the more that I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:41:59.846Z)

It's that when I read its answer, I'm like, oh, yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:02.565Z)

the deal ecosystem

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:03.146Z)

Oops. Forgot about that.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:03.875Z)

uses, the software, the more information we're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:04.736Z)

Right. Right. And so but we have to have the data to do that. Right? And so that's

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:06.445Z)

collect. And then the number of individual information

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:10.176Z)

goal. The more deals that get underwritten and the more that

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:11.195Z)

that would be the of our company. Right? So gonna have a nominalization

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:14.546Z)

the deal ecosystem uses the software, the more information we're able to collect.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:16.105Z)

of lock down. Like, on you know, on super control

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:19.276Z)

And then, again, we will never give out any individual information.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:19.955Z)

But that know that You know, young analyst, they don't always

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:23.406Z)

That would be the death of our company. Right? So we're gonna have anonymization and lock

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:23.845Z)

know. Too. When I'm was a 27 year old analyst. And I really

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:28.376Z)

down

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:28.535Z)

cool and to some of

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:29.256Z)

like, on, you know, on super control. But

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:29.585Z)

these downturns. I would make a mistake like that Just simp

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:32.496Z)

that I know exact and and, you know, young analysts, they don't always know too. When I was

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:32.915Z)

by not really on understanding. Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:37.406Z)

a 27 year old analyst and I hadn't really lived

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:38.545Z)

Okay. Here's another question. Know, when you do

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:41.086Z)

some of these downturns, I would have made a mistake like that

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:41.615Z)

do a heavy rent renovation, take offline.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:44.346Z)

just simply by not really understanding flex and flow.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:44.465Z)

Is that calculation? That if I around one sort of

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:47.926Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:48.355Z)

do over here on my own and then just have that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:49.066Z)

Right. Okay. Here's another question.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:50.845Z)

reflect. In the red. Part? Or is there, like, a worksheet or

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:52.596Z)

You know, when you do do a heavy renovation, take rooms offline.

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:53.535Z)

there We'll have a worksheet for that. And that'll be in our

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:42:56.696Z)

Is that a calculation that if I were underwriting sort of

### You (2025-07-09T18:42:57.885Z)

our our road. Map. But as like, what we have in

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:00.816Z)

do over here on my own and then just have that reflected in the rep

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:01.845Z)

mind is that you don't have

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:03.836Z)

RevPAR? Or is there, like, a work or is there We'll have a work

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:04.745Z)

four revenue for food and fabric. Just like

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:07.756Z)

for that, and that'll be in our our our road map.

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:08.205Z)

you have spa. Your phone. Because more complicated. Right? Or say, doing some sort of really big value add

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:12.456Z)

But, essentially, like, what we have in mind is that

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:14.555Z)

project, Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:16.776Z)

you'll have for

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:16.815Z)

That you actually be able to

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:18.576Z)

revenue, for food and beverage. Like, say you have

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:19.345Z)

like how we're just showing you the pop ups. Like, so we'll have a pop

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:21.596Z)

spa or golf. It's more complicated. Right? Or say you're

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:22.865Z)

up. Deep dive analysis.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:25.126Z)

doing some sort of really big value add

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:25.465Z)

That allows you to commit depending on what

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:27.946Z)

project, right, that you

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:28.215Z)

deep you wanna go. Lender may have a bearing. High level

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:30.966Z)

will actually be able to like Howard was showing you the pop ups. Like, so we'll have a

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:31.585Z)

deep in analysis. Right? Rate tape rooms out infant then

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:35.606Z)

pop up deep dive analysis that allows you to

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:35.685Z)

assume a certain ADR fund. An operator was probably going way

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:40.396Z)

mean, depending on how deep you wanna go. A lender may have a very high level

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:41.445Z)

and say okay. Here are my 15 segmentation lines Right? And I need to

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:44.916Z)

deep analysis, right, where you take rooms out of inventory,

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:45.995Z)

grow corporate. You know, corporate by this and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:48.386Z)

and then you assume a certain ADR bump.

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:49.315Z)

retail by this. And so by

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:43:52.036Z)

An operator is probably going way deeper and saying, okay. Here are my 50 segmentation lines. Right? And I need to grow corporate

### You (2025-07-09T18:43:52.195Z)

having about and Drew to to out to the level that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:00.826Z)

corporate by this and retail by this.

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:00.865Z)

I agree respect. It. Customer in our ecosystem

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:04.066Z)

And so by having Howard and Vinod and Drew working together on this,

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:07.625Z)

But that's a really big thing. Right? Because and then what I'm went to play

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:10.786Z)

we'll be able to drill down to the level that

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:10.795Z)

meat as an acid and then I take my acid manager

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:14.316Z)

every respective

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:15.895Z)

I would really love

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:16.986Z)

customer in our ecosystem needs.

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:17.175Z)

to be able to say that I'm under wrote You know what you see when you do underwrite?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:20.666Z)

But that's a really big thing. Right? Because and then what I would like me as an asset at

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:20.965Z)

You say, okay. I believe this renovation will create $2,000,000 more and then I'll NOI.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:25.636Z)

I'm putting my asset manager or investment manager hat on

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:26.215Z)

I would love for future to have

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:28.736Z)

I would really love to be able to say that I underwrote

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:29.915Z)

place where done that ROI analysis

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:32.806Z)

know, when you when you do an underwriting and you say, okay. I believe this renovation will create $2,000,000 more in NOI. But I would love for our

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:33.075Z)

you can actually track the results the underwriting. Like, that be in a update. Thing. Us. To be able to say we thought

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:41.156Z)

future to have a place where you've

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:41.355Z)

that And here is the map mathematics. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:44.176Z)

done that ROI analysis and you can actually track

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:44.655Z)

That roll up the program on direct then we're tracking it up

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:48.186Z)

the results to the underwriting.

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:49.485Z)

right now, this is how it actually

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:51.206Z)

Like, that would be an amazing thing for us to be able to say is we thought this.

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:51.895Z)

played out. And you know, 10% of our

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:55.396Z)

And here is the mathematics, right, that rolled up into the broader

### You (2025-07-09T18:44:56.095Z)

goal. And on your right Because because again, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:44:59.616Z)

underwriting. And then because we're tracking it on a regular

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:00.345Z)

a it's those blend of level. You probably will stick with ADR.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:03.536Z)

this is how it actually played out, and we were within, you know,

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:04.065Z)

ADR. Parked. Works out. The tour. Certain, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:07.966Z)

10% of our goals and underwriting.

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:08.365Z)

margin improvement based on more revenue Right?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:11.286Z)

Because because, again, like, at the at the lender level,

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:11.685Z)

Something like that. But if I'm David said, then I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:15.266Z)

probably will stick with ADR occupancy, RevPAR, rooms out of inventory.

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:15.985Z)

I I fucking get into something that's a lot more detailed

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:19.696Z)

Maybe certain, like, margin improvement based on more revenue

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:19.785Z)

on that in that you know, on on the equity side then. We have the because

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:24.636Z)

Right? Something like that.

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:25.475Z)

that direct me crazy on the equity

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:26.096Z)

But if I'm Davidson, then I

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:27.005Z)

side. It's not being able to actually follow that kind of stuff. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:29.656Z)

I hope I'm getting into something that's a lot more deep

### You (2025-07-09T18:45:30.615Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:45:32.676Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:28.246Z)

this is a this is not a very common sponsor, but

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:28.505Z)

Talk to times incredibly

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:31.266Z)

feel like we've seen them before. And you type that sponsor in and then there pops up the deal that you looked at

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:31.885Z)

informative. Especially on lending side because you're like, wait a second.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:36.236Z)

before.

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:36.395Z)

We almost did a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:37.496Z)

Those prior deals, whether it be by sponsor or by box,

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:37.715Z)

deal on this. Asset. Or whatever. They were requesting loan proceeds

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:41.776Z)

maybe by brand, whatever,

15% higher 15% lower

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:43.896Z)

are oftentimes incredibly

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:45.805Z)

Why don't we hear Wait a sec. We've seen this still twice

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:47.696Z)

informative Mhmm. Especially on the lending

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:49.255Z)

before this. This. Episode.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:51.106Z)

side because you're like, wait a second. We almost

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:51.215Z)

Always. Fail.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:54.126Z)

did a deal on this asset where they were requesting

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:54.215Z)

Yeah. If you have, like, this. And not gotten there, several times

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:47:58.526Z)

loan proceeds 15% higher or 15% lower

### You (2025-07-09T18:47:59.485Z)

And never works. You know? Even though the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:02.776Z)

Why are we here?

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:03.165Z)

situation might be right,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:04.496Z)

A second. We've seen this deal twice before. This this

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:04.595Z)

It's so informative. To be able to have those

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:07.186Z)

asset always fails. That's a broken deal. Right?

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:07.505Z)

prior iterations with you or even to say

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:11.046Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Like, we have liked it,

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:12.005Z)

oh my god. We looked at

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:13.036Z)

and not gotten there

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:13.835Z)

this deal. This sponsor.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:15.036Z)

several times

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:15.695Z)

Before. I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:16.576Z)

and it never works.

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:17.885Z)

I'm gonna go

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:18.136Z)

You know? And even though this iteration might be right, it's so informative.

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:18.645Z)

ask. 60 what And then see is like, oh,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:23.106Z)

To be able to have those prior iterations

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:23.285Z)

my god. Then you lie? Through. Their tea.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:26.376Z)

with you or even to say, oh my god. We looked at this

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:28.295Z)

Their money, save our teeth,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:30.926Z)

deal with this sponsor before.

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:31.405Z)

So if we could

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:33.326Z)

I wasn't on it, but I'm gonna go ask Susie who what

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:33.585Z)

you can have that trace. Ability, which is probably already

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:37.486Z)

And then Susie is like, oh my god.

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:38.565Z)

somewhat inherent in the just the fact that

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:41.226Z)

They lied through their teeth.

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:41.325Z)

a database. That you're growing. That

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:44.546Z)

Wasted months of our time. You know?

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:45.895Z)

to me is like, it's like a way

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:48.096Z)

So if we if you can

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:49.245Z)

to

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:51.166Z)

have

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:51.215Z)

It's institution. Knowledge.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:52.296Z)

that traceability, which is probably already somewhat

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:52.705Z)

Even though have continuity of workforce. Tell me your class

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:48:56.016Z)

inherent in the just the fact that it's a database that you are growing,

### You (2025-07-09T18:48:56.825Z)

Right? Yeah. And even if they may not have been that one.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:00.266Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:01.165Z)

They don't.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:02.026Z)

That to me is like

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:02.355Z)

Yeah. Howard, Howard,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:03.956Z)

it's like a way to create institutional knowledge even though you may not have

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:06.495Z)

Yeah. I I I think we've got that covered. Mhmm. First off,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:10.886Z)

continuity of workforce?

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:11.535Z)

the the hierarchy

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:12.576Z)

Total continuity. Right? Yeah. Even if some of the people are there,

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:14.305Z)

of how we would implement a client would

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:16.706Z)

they may not have been the one dealt with them.

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:18.185Z)

be at the account level.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:19.726Z)

Howard, how did you what what are your thoughts on that? Because you're you'll be the one that

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:20.155Z)

So you know, if if if the the Jane Smith broker creates an account, and Jane Smith has five people. Working for her. So they would be five users. So Right. But every deal is associated to the account. Not the user. That's numb number one. That would be how you could get this shared between colleagues or former people or colleague, like you said, that's left and no longer there.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:51.996Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:49:53.755Z)

The second part is what I touched on real real quick. When I showed you the property details model, the census ID.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:49:58.036Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T18:50:01.225Z)

Which is the star report, ID which is from my understanding the only consistent property ID used throughout the property, so whatever Jane Smith has for the census ID, If I start underwriting it, you know, I'll have that same census ID in our system that will tie that we'll know that that hotel, no matter what the name is, no matter who owns it, etcetera, we will have the historical information on that hotel. And another thing that I did skip over, which I shouldn't have, but but you can create versions of these under the underwriting. I might go through a process of underwriting everything and I'll call it Howard's version one. And then I can go through and do other scenarios. So I can create what if scenarios, etcetera. But at the same time, then like you said, three years down the road, you wanna take a look at it. Well, you can back and say, oh, yeah. Howard wrote worked on this back in in July of twenty twenty five. Here's what he came up

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:51:12.966Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-09T18:51:15.095Z)

with. Then. And and and and we can just just go from there. So, yeah, you will have the access to historical files, as long as they're not deleted. Which they wouldn't be in our system, but they could be in yours. Right? Or Sure. Can yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. I I do like the idea, though, of of the note field where you can say they lie to you teeth. You know, we'll I do. I like Yeah. Yeah. I I I actually other than the document upload, I don't think we've

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:51:48.216Z)

Sure. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T18:51:49.725Z)

anything in there right now for just general comments on the overall deal. That's

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:51:51.216Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:51:54.005Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:00.776Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:01.435Z)

you know speed. The cut

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:04.516Z)

oh, go ahead.

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:04.765Z)

every deal a snowflake. Yeah. You know? You wanna I know. Call qualify

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:12.906Z)

I will say I am a huge fan

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:12.995Z)

You you might put next expense in one category

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:16.006Z)

of the

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:16.175Z)

wouldn't. Or something like that.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:17.306Z)

just sort of

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:18.705Z)

It just had a little

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:18.916Z)

notes field.

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:19.615Z)

note. That

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:20.096Z)

Because every deal is a snowflake,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:20.415Z)

every said you know, what this there. As well.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:24.166Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:24.385Z)

Yeah. Or whatever. It's like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:25.956Z)

I don't know, qualify,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:26.205Z)

it just stumbled. That If it's me, I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:29.866Z)

You you might put an expense in one category that you normally wouldn't

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:29.945Z)

something that otherwise sometimes kinda useless because you don't know. You don't.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:33.976Z)

or something like that. And to just have a little note there,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:34.655Z)

You know, it looks like when you look at a p and l and they're

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:37.516Z)

that says,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:37.765Z)

like the other income

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:39.026Z)

you know, I put this there. This is why I did it.

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:40.055Z)

And usually, it's pretty small.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:41.566Z)

Or whatever. It's like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:41.585Z)

And it helps and so in a way negligible.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:43.786Z)

it just solves that

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:44.645Z)

You're like, is this

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:45.546Z)

To me, it makes something that is otherwise sometimes kinda useless

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:46.575Z)

parking? It's the same telephone

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:49.736Z)

because you don't know

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:50.345Z)

because it's way too

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:51.226Z)

you don't you know, there's but it's like when you look at a p and l and there's,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:52.035Z)

back. Out in the future. It's a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:55.006Z)

the other income. Mhmm. And usually, it's a

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:55.935Z)

what is it? Great. And

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:52:58.026Z)

small amount and so in a way negligible. But you're like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:52:58.815Z)

you know, what happens is to with with those notes

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:02.746Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:02.805Z)

sex es, you quickly

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:04.706Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:05.245Z)

to cut

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:05.836Z)

telephones? Because we need to zero that out in the future. Is it

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:06.425Z)

liberty. That 14 Yeah. And we don't think we Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:10.806Z)

you know, what happens is

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:16.885Z)

time. Trying to figure something out that may be very

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:17.916Z)

if with with those note sections, you can

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:19.515Z)

inconsequential or whatever.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:21.036Z)

very quickly map to kind of the liberties that were taken

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:23.435Z)

On the topic of that, I was gonna say,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:25.446Z)

and be able to go, okay.

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:26.565Z)

you know, if there sort of

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:28.186Z)

Okay. Now it makes sense. I can ignore that or whatever, and you don't end up

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:28.365Z)

catch all of like an expenses or whatever, but whether

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:32.526Z)

you know, spending time trying to figure something out that may be very inconsequential.

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:33.735Z)

there's, like, a catch all. Worksheet. Then his for

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:37.496Z)

Or whatever.

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:39.255Z)

random

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:39.876Z)

And on the topic of that,

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:39.975Z)

things that don't fit in categories.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:42.306Z)

I was gonna say, you know, is there sort of a

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:43.525Z)

So you know, one thing that's coming to mind is, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:45.676Z)

catch all kind of kind of like in other expenses or whatever, but whether there's, like, a

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:48.315Z)

what if your property is tight? For, like, earthquake retrofit

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:51.416Z)

catch all, almost like worksheet,

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:52.015Z)

expense? Translates

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:53.746Z)

that is for

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:57.215Z)

and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:53:57.546Z)

things that don't really fit in the category. So

### You (2025-07-09T18:53:58.635Z)

taught line. Grim It's all just

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:54:01.456Z)

you know, one thing that's coming to mind is, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:54:01.485Z)

almost cost basis. But, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:54:04.526Z)

what if your property is tagged for, like, earthquake retrofit expense?

### You (2025-07-09T18:54:04.985Z)

because you just there's it's adds to your purchase price to do it. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:54:09.496Z)

None of that translates

### You (2025-07-09T18:54:09.675Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:29.495Z)

And then he brought on blue green.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:32.146Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:37.875Z)

the deal. And then

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:39.246Z)

I forget

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:40.055Z)

we have

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:40.436Z)

specifically, but

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:40.625Z)

to figure out it. And then, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:41.916Z)

he had this

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:42.115Z)

a sales model

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:42.956Z)

crazy deal where he had, like, a

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:43.985Z)

where it's, like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:44.606Z)

NOI guarantee from Choice, and then he brought on blue green.

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:45.665Z)

start He could sell Bluegreen windows. And I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:49.576Z)

And blue green was buying one unit at a time. He condominiumized the deal.

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:50.385Z)

got like, certain amount of reimburse reimbursement plus for offering

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:55:56.276Z)

And then we had to figure out and he had, like, a

### You (2025-07-09T18:55:56.375Z)

that blue green. So there's, like, a revenue split on Bluegreen Grill. But that's blue green grill,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:00.176Z)

sales model where it was, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:01.065Z)

only sold after x

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:02.116Z)

he had to start he could sell blue green rooms

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:02.705Z)

percent of the hotel but not not

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:06.236Z)

and then he got

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:07.205Z)

totally like, they had to be

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:08.236Z)

like, a certain amount of reimbursement

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:08.935Z)

put in into after a certain occupancy.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:11.066Z)

plus

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:11.805Z)

So in other words,

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:12.216Z)

for operating that blue green. So there's, like, a revenue

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:12.665Z)

the owner sell it last but they

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:15.416Z)

on the blue green room, but those blue green rooms were only sold after x

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:16.005Z)

you know, under all the obligation to sell it. For see them? Mhmm. And

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:19.906Z)

percent of the hotel. But not

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:21.975Z)

then we were looking at it really

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:23.136Z)

not totally like, they had to be

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:23.805Z)

we do if we end up foreclosing

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:26.156Z)

and, like, I don't remember. Maybe a 150 units. Yeah. A hundred and fifty fifty keys to begin with.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:29.946Z)

the owner couldn't sell it last

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:32.205Z)

And then we're down to a 138, and we

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:32.656Z)

but they weren't, you know, under obligation to sell it first either.

### You (2025-07-09T18:56:36.365Z)

12 units are owned by Bluegreen.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:56:37.566Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:58:27.636Z)

and be able to effectively underwrite it using the tool

### You (2025-07-09T18:58:29.725Z)

really came with the sale.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:58:45.696Z)

### You (2025-07-09T18:58:46.885Z)

To Bluegreen. Once they end up demand, for

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:58:50.666Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:27.096Z)

utilizing this model? Or is this a deal where we go, you know what,

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:27.975Z)

know, far and I like that. Exception.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:31.436Z)

not using Invest on this deal. We're just gonna underwrite this using Excel and

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:31.815Z)

Or, like, like, something to get kicked into. Almost like a special service.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:36.016Z)

No. We wanna use an invest on that, and that's an excellent point. So you're saying it's not

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:36.245Z)

Thing. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. Like, like, special circumstance where you're like, okay. Literally, I

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:40.656Z)

finding the document. It's when you have a weird situation like that and you need to underwrite

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:42.865Z)

to tell, but it's a red one. And so we're just gonna have the data enter and

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:45.566Z)

the document. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:45.725Z)

every single number. Or they keep

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:48.486Z)

Yeah. That's great feedback.

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:49.715Z)

on this. Side.

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:50.956Z)

And maybe it's like, you know,

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:51.345Z)

Sort of Yeah. Yeah. However you handle it, but there would be, like, a

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:52.906Z)

far enough down Like a catchall or some sort of exceptions or, like,

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:55.135Z)

you could catch all for the

### Guest (2025-07-09T18:59:57.096Z)

like, something has to get kicked into a almost like a special service in

### You (2025-07-09T18:59:57.385Z)

wonky deals. That are just just cannot

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:01.526Z)

know what I mean? Like Right. Yeah. Right. Like, special circumstance where you're like,

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:02.535Z)

solve. Around. That yeah. And it's great.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:05.056Z)

okay. Literally, unfortunately, it's a complicated deal, but it's a rich one, and so we're just gonna

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:06.515Z)

Which goes back to my dinosaur brain. You know, I'm always like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:09.576Z)

have to data enter every single number

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:09.865Z)

you know, well,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:12.196Z)

manually. Or And keep notes on the side.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:12.615Z)

get to that in the medics there's another thing that comes up. So, by the way, I know

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:15.456Z)

Of why Keep notes. Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:16.315Z)

you're you're you were talking about

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:17.666Z)

However you handle it, but there would be, like, a

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:17.995Z)

using this for apps.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:20.406Z)

like, a catch all for the wonky deals.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:21.325Z)

You know, it's it's so interesting because conceptually to me, I

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:23.956Z)

That are just you you just cannot

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:25.435Z)

a lot more time on the acquisitions or

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:27.266Z)

solve around

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:27.525Z)

origination side than I have on the asset

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:29.006Z)

That yeah. That is great.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:29.225Z)

asset management side. And what I wanted when I have an asset

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:32.336Z)

Goes back to my dinosaur brain. You know, I'm always like,

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:32.865Z)

man management, I'm in debt. Asset management. Management. No. I've never

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:35.346Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:35.565Z)

been. An equity asset manager.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:37.456Z)

well, I'll get to that in a minute because there's another thing that comes up. So, by the way, I know you're

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:38.095Z)

I been as deal person. So surprised

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:42.216Z)

you're you were talking about using this for asset management. I agree wholeheartedly.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:44.405Z)

what deal with. My asset managers.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:46.516Z)

You know, it's it's so interesting because conceptually to me and I've spent a lot more

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:47.115Z)

With how difficult it is. To, like, take

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:51.456Z)

time on the acquisitions origination side than I have on the asset management side.

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:51.605Z)

acquisition I'm like, well, now we now fake number that I

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:55.916Z)

And when I was

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:56.535Z)

dreamt up when I was

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:00:57.196Z)

I have been asset management, I've been debt asset management. Not I've never been

### You (2025-07-09T19:00:57.485Z)

underwriting it, just plug in the real number and they're like, it was more

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:01.416Z)

equity asset manager. I have been, as a deal person,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:05.315Z)

and failed to understand why it doesn't.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:05.906Z)

so

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:07.755Z)

But, yeah,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:07.896Z)

surprised

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:09.015Z)

It may

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:09.896Z)

when I deal with my asset managers with how difficult it is

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:10.175Z)

okay. I'm trying not to get frustrated with your lack of understanding of what I do.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:15.706Z)

like, take an acquisitions model. I'm like,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:16.315Z)

But I cannot do that. So I think it's

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:18.806Z)

well, now we now instead of having that fake number that I dreamt up when I was underwriting, it just

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:19.365Z)

great if you can design it too. That works for acquisition

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:23.746Z)

plug in the real number. And they're like,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:24.985Z)

asset

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:26.006Z)

doesn't work like that. And I'm like, I I literally to this day, twenty six years into my career,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:26.645Z)

and disposition. Dispositions, like how that would be amazing.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:30.916Z)

fail to understand why it doesn't. But the asset managers are like,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:31.435Z)

Amazing. Said when you started, like, that's the like, that's that's our goal.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:36.496Z)

okay. I'm trying not to get frustrated with your

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:36.515Z)

Yeah. And we think can be the first property type to do it because

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:39.516Z)

lack of understanding of what I do, but I cannot do that. So

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:41.075Z)

we are a very tight knit

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:44.106Z)

I think it's great if you can

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:44.245Z)

ecosystem community. Where brands are a big part of our business. Right? And so compared to all

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:46.606Z)

design a tool that works for acquisitions

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:49.365Z)

offer

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:50.416Z)

asset management, and dispositions like

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:50.485Z)

retail, we have some advantage in as to our network and

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:54.246Z)

hallelujah,

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:54.705Z)

why we could our

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:55.906Z)

That would be amazing.

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:56.255Z)

our small size

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:01:57.426Z)

Right? And then, Howard, that's what you said when you started. Like, that's the like, that's

### You (2025-07-09T19:01:57.455Z)

and our connected we are home. On here. I think I

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:01.276Z)

that's our goal, cradle to grave. And we think we can be the first property

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:02.025Z)

really feel like we could be the first proper time to go cranial to grade

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:05.106Z)

to do it because we are a very

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:05.245Z)

digitally on them. Yeah. So Just to set shed some light on there.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:08.726Z)

tight knit ecosystem community where brands are a big

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:10.255Z)

That is one of the first initiatives that I implemented

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:12.286Z)

part of our business. Right? And so compared to office,

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:14.655Z)

RedeyeQ. Because

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:15.306Z)

or retail, we have some advantages

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:17.215Z)

like you said, you've got that

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:18.596Z)

as to our network and why we could

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:18.615Z)

acquisition model but you use the same data

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:21.276Z)

our our small size and how

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:22.915Z)

as your going through.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:24.776Z)

closely connected we are all are, I think I really do believe we could be the first property type to go cradle to grave.

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:26.005Z)

So what we would do, number one is we would need to break down into monthly increments. Right now for the proof of concept it's just

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:30.826Z)

Digitally on this. So

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:33.635Z)

twenty twenty twenty twenty four. Right? Right. But all they need to do is each month just just upload a copy of their financial statement. And they can upload a budget and they can compare your actual to budget, which is what any financial statement already does. One of the things directly by your partnership with hotel bins. Right? Because again, we're we're

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:02:57.316Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T19:02:57.755Z)

try to the point where we're pulling all of that up directly from the

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:00.596Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:01.155Z)

there. So we're you know, taking away the the mail. Thing. It's it's either we have a long way to go. Right. Yeah. But but what you're describing is is pretty basic. Process of what we need to do

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:15.806Z)

Or get that information directly

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:17.745Z)

what I was going to say is, you know, any financial system now already does

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:20.106Z)

by our partnership with Hotel Biz. Right? Because, again, we're we're gonna try to get to the point where

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:22.455Z)

actual versus budget, but what we have is the pro

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:24.476Z)

pulling all of that up directly from the operator. And so we're

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:25.625Z)

form a. And so as an asset manager, I

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:27.856Z)

you know, taking away the the man I mean, it's that's

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:29.505Z)

I not only wanna see

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:03:31.236Z)

years where we have a long way to go. But

### You (2025-07-09T19:03:31.275Z)

how am I comparing to my budget, but overall, how am I comparing to my pro form a. Am I outperforming? I thought it would be. If am I underperforming? What what do I what steps do I need to take to get it back in line or adjustments. You're looking it's more forward looking. Your financials it's all rear view mirror. Right. Right. Water under the bridge. But yeah, that that's absolutely when when I talked earlier about the asset management

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:00.056Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:02.075Z)

portion, that's exactly what it is that we're that we're gonna be doing. It's like I'm wonder such good feedback. And and, like, the backing into it. To think about

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:16.076Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:16.605Z)

more of a depth perspective that equity perspective. Perspective that brilliant. And

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:20.766Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:21.335Z)

don't think we would have thought like that and

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:21.866Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:23.545Z)

initially. So is there a way that just stay on your radar? Screen and, like, get that, you know, give give you call in a couple of weeks

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:30.586Z)

Hey, guys. I need to go. I'm a little bit late for a call, but

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:30.705Z)

and maybe just reconnect. With them. I know. Have a song for us or

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:34.536Z)

Kara, do you I mean, this has been wonderful. You've given us

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:35.155Z)

if you you know think of anyone.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:37.606Z)

such good feedback and it and, like, the backing into it.

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:37.615Z)

Who might be interested in doing a small pilot

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:41.226Z)

To think about it more from a debt perspective than an equity perspective, that's

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:41.395Z)

know anything along those lines? Appreciate the feedback

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:45.296Z)

really brilliant. And I don't

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:46.015Z)

And honestly, you never know, like, who

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:47.576Z)

we would have thought like that initially. So is there a way that we can just

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:47.835Z)

where we're just starting, but come you know,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:51.976Z)

on your radar screen and, like, get that, you know,

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:51.995Z)

eight six, eight months from now, you know, like, ready to launch into

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:54.686Z)

give give you a call in a couple of weeks and maybe just reconnect? And if you have any of your any other thoughts,

### You (2025-07-09T19:04:55.315Z)

deploy. Again. The definite structured finance market. It's something you'd be interested in,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:04:59.656Z)

for us or if you, you know, think of anyone who might

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:00.565Z)

there's an opportunity for us to work together too. Because I don't know

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:03.696Z)

interested in doing a small

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:03.925Z)

this would have been you may not. Wanna you know, do anything

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:06.286Z)

pilot without do you know anything along those lines, we'd really appreciate the feedback. And

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:06.855Z)

technology related, but structure.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:11.256Z)

and, honestly, you never know. Like, we're we're just starting, but

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:11.885Z)

Back. Yet we feel like this tool and I makes

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:16.076Z)

come, you know, eight six, eight months from now when we're really, really ready to launch and to

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:16.195Z)

fit them structured finance That's first almost. Right? But so

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:21.046Z)

against the debt and structured finance market,

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:21.345Z)

putting that out. There too. Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:24.186Z)

it's something you'd be interested in, maybe there's an opportunity for us to work together

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:25.005Z)

Yeah. Will like go. This is this is fun. Exciting for you guys.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:28.556Z)

too because I don't know if this would I mean, you may not wanna, you know, do anything

It seems like a really great tool. Yeah. I will I will send you an email really quick

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:32.506Z)

technology related, but none of us have debt instructions

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:34.115Z)

because I do have just a couple more thoughts. And, again,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:36.786Z)

finance.

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:36.975Z)

lot of this is like,

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:37.916Z)

Background, yet we feel like this tool

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:37.985Z)

you know, I'm sure things you are thought through, but

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:40.936Z)

actually may fit debt and structured finance

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:41.735Z)

you know, whatever. If it's trying, I may be now.

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:43.646Z)

best first almost. Right? But so just putting that out there too.

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:44.175Z)

We did. Had Yeah. We did. Think through the backing it up. Like you did on the lender side. So

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:48.556Z)

Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I will let you go.

### You (2025-07-09T19:05:50.425Z)

### Guest (2025-07-09T19:05:56.996Z)
