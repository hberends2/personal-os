# Transcript for: Howard | Vinod weekly call

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:31:46.072Z)

I could have taken easier approach to just extract the data, but I think the long term approach would be to have our own model trained.

### You (2025-08-04T21:31:46.233Z)

Good afternoon. In the long term approach would be to have our own model trained.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:31:56.712Z)

And kind of give us lot of output in long term.

### You (2025-08-04T21:31:57.433Z)

And. Yeah. I think we're going to need that. Definitely. Okay? Well, cool. You said you've been testing it. Already.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:32:17.512Z)

No, it's not working correctly right now.

### You (2025-08-04T21:32:19.113Z)

It's not looking at a.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:32:24.392Z)

So it's still kind of working on that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:32:25.433Z)

Kind of working on that. Okay? I have. Only I've made a couple of minor updates.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:32:38.072Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:32:39.113Z)

On the poc. So I think I've sent out an email, one of them. I just updated the PRD today, but I think I might have mentioned it. On our call. Team call, I think.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:32:54.472Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:32:56.793Z)

Drew brought up. The request to be able to have market comps just like we did@red IQ. So I did add on page one of the property details modal checkbox just like we did before. So if it's a market comp, they can check it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:33:07.272Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T21:33:18.393Z)

And that way we can use the pipeline to filter and group and take those out of the overall metrics.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:33:30.472Z)

One more thing. I was thinking on that property detail model,

### You (2025-08-04T21:33:30.553Z)

One more thing. I was thinking property, if you remember. I think it was true. Only was saying that we wanted to segregate. Whether we are underwriting the property or whether I own or the property, right?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:33:34.872Z)

If you remember, I think it was Drew only who was saying that we wanted to segregate. Whether we are underwriting a property or whether I am the owner of the property, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:33:45.433Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:33:47.192Z)

Thinking whether that should go on that model, or will be able to determine that based on the user type itself.

### You (2025-08-04T21:33:49.193Z)

That should go. Based on things you have hired itself. Yeah. That is for the asset manager. So there might be use cases outside of asset management. But I can't think of any. But one of the things that I don't know if you remember, we brought it up on a call maybe a couple weeks ago.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:34:10.792Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:34:24.473Z)

That initially we want to focus on lenders. And servicers because they don't get down into the details. So we don't have to worry about food and beverage and all the underlying subcategories.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:34:41.032Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T21:34:42.393Z)

So that I think would also apply to something like what you just mentioned. I don't think we would need that for a lender. I mean, lenders don't own properties. Low in service, don't own. So I think we'll be okay. There. I think there's probably one or two other of the Personas. I mean investors. And brokers. Will eventually. We do need to get down into those line item details.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:10.392Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:35:11.273Z)

So while we're letting the lenders and the servicers and those testers. We can start working down the other ones. While they're going through and kicking the tires.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:29.832Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T21:35:29.913Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:30.392Z)

Okay? So I think we are fine without that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:35:31.113Z)

So I think we are fine. Without that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:33.992Z)

For now, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:35:35.913Z)

And that came up in my weekly call with Diane today as well. She was talking about some conversations she had, and so. You're familiar with Lark, the data. Right. That is. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:53.272Z)

Market data.

### You (2025-08-04T21:35:54.473Z)

Market data, and that is part of a consulting group.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:35:56.072Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:36:01.113Z)

That basically all they do is. Loan underwriting. Anyway. They don't do investment underwriting or anything else. I'm pretty sure it's lone. It's some lw advisory group. I'll send you the URL. And you can take a look at it. But when you go to their home page, There's a link called predictive analytics that takes to the lark. Website.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:36:36.472Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T21:36:38.713Z)

She said she had a really good conversation with them. Drew talked to them as well. It's the guy that Mark knows. So it sounds to me. Like number one. They're interested in investing. And invest. And number two, they would have a use case for it. With that. So Diane and I, we're talking about the fact that we really need to focus on just getting this out. So that they can start testing it as well.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:13.912Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:15.913Z)

That makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:22.792Z)

I mean, trying to complete the MVPS soon as you can.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:25.833Z)

To complete the ups on every time.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:31.592Z)

I can take an easier path from data extraction.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:31.753Z)

I can take a path from data extraction.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:37.032Z)

I just thought we still have little bandwidth, so kind of make that model solid.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:37.113Z)

I just start with average. Bangwood kind of make that model solid.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:47.592Z)

If I think that we are moving very slow, then I probably extracted using some either easier to learn some Python code.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:47.593Z)

If I think I am more slower. Than I probably extract it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:59.512Z)

But yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:37:59.833Z)

But, yeah, I would love this model to work.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:37:59.992Z)

I would love this model to work. As we expect.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:03.913Z)

As. As we expect. And that would be a huge win. We'll be able to do longer with that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:05.592Z)

And that would be a huge win. We would be able to do a lot of work with that. But yeah. If I feel like it's consuming a lot of time.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:14.393Z)

I feel like nice consuming amount of time.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:17.032Z)

Right now. Shivam has been spending some time on that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:17.273Z)

Right now, Shiloh has been spending. Some time on the high.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:22.152Z)

I was mostly working on the instructor side of it.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:22.473Z)

I was mostly working on the infectious, trying different approaches.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:26.392Z)

Trying different approaches. Like we were trying to use something called SageMaker that AWS provides, and then.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:27.913Z)

Like we were trying to use sales. Something of sales maker that AWS provides. I tried kind of using hybrid approach, document based database.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:37.752Z)

I tried kind of using hybrid approach. Document based database. Postgres so when the extraction happens.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:46.713Z)

So when the expectation happens that they are just codes.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:48.312Z)

The data just goes as is in the document based.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:50.313Z)

As it is in the document based.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:54.632Z)

What you call database.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:55.193Z)

So that we don't have six column.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:55.512Z)

So that we don't have fixed column.

### You (2025-08-04T21:38:58.073Z)

It just kind of consumes it from there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:38:58.712Z)

It just kind of consumes it as is. And from there. We run the etl process to get the data from this dynamodb into our selected data into the pssq postgres SQL.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:02.313Z)

Process to get the data from this dynamod into our selected data into the tss.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:39:15.112Z)

Yeah, initially I was just trying to do with postgres.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:15.833Z)

I was just trying to do postgres that are becoming harder.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:39:18.632Z)

And that was kind of becoming harder.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:20.633Z)

And this approach might work.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:39:21.192Z)

But this approach might work.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:22.313Z)

So kind of making some progress there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:39:22.792Z)

So kind of making some progress there.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:24.393Z)

Okay? All right. Let me know if there's anything I can do.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:39:26.232Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:39:29.513Z)

The call that I want to schedule with you and Diane. In our call, she asked again about do we need a third engineer with AI background, and I told her that you had some thoughts on that. And that we should make sure that the three of us talk about it. And something that occurred to me is. What do we need an engineer with AI background or somebody on the product side with a background? And so that's something that we could discuss on Friday is like, do we need somebody who's going to actually write the code? Or do we have. Would it be better if we had somebody who's actually, from a product management standpoint, developed these types of tools? Know which ones are worthwhile. So it could be a short call, but just give you a heads up. That's what we wanted to touch base on.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:40:29.672Z)

Sure. I'm from product side. I think you do lot of great research and provide that valuable insight.

### You (2025-08-04T21:40:32.793Z)

I think you do not great research. And provide that value inside. Well, I appreciate that. But I don't really have much hands on experience with it other than what we did@red IQ. Yeah. I don't mind continuing. In fact, I will continue to research and play with new toys. But yeah. I really kind of feel that you and I can handle it. And that we don't need another person. But let's at least have a conversation with Diane and make sure she 's aligned as well.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:41:06.392Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:41:13.913Z)

Correct.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:41:14.392Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:41:16.713Z)

For the management. There is definitely a.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:41:16.952Z)

From engineering perspective. We'll definitely have to engineer. Add more people down the line. Even from. I don't know, from product. I'll let you take the call.

### You (2025-08-04T21:41:30.073Z)

But once we go. Support required from production support.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:41:30.472Z)

But once we go live, right? There will be a lot of support required from production support, kind of running the failing documents. Probably retraining our model on those failing documents so that they fail lesser and lesser day by day.

### You (2025-08-04T21:41:43.433Z)

Probably a bit crazy on those trading government. So they're not doing the field. And then, of course, the supporting.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:41:51.832Z)

And then, of course, kind of supporting the application, adding new features.

### You (2025-08-04T21:41:57.993Z)

And future.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:01.272Z)

And there are a lot of things, like you've got to do a lot of testing.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:02.553Z)

You got to do a lot of testing, performance.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:05.192Z)

Their performance that you need testing all those things. Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:08.633Z)

And security right now.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:08.712Z)

And then security infrastructure right now. Doing all that? But even. And you know that that's the kind of person I want.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:16.073Z)

That's the kind of person I want.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:19.192Z)

Who doesn't say for this piece of work. I mean, there are a lot of help from pooling perspective these days, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:27.033Z)

These days.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:28.232Z)

So there's live coding and all this.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:28.873Z)

Live coding and all this. And.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:31.432Z)

And then people should really be able to kind of perform on all the front.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:35.433Z)

All the part. Someone can be a program on one side.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:36.472Z)

Yeah. Someone can be stronger on one side. As in our team, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:38.873Z)

And now working right?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:40.552Z)

Raj is more strong on the infrastructure side.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:40.953Z)

Is more stronger.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:45.912Z)

Warm has more. App development side so you can work on database.

### You (2025-08-04T21:42:50.233Z)

So you can walk on day. But I'm not telling them to just focus on that strong data.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:42:54.632Z)

But then I'm not telling them to just focus on their strong areas, but rather work throughout. Otherwise, you know, we don't have so much work.

### You (2025-08-04T21:43:06.073Z)

So much work. In just one area. We cannot just have one.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:43:07.512Z)

In just one area. Like, we cannot just have one infrastructure engineer and then sitting idle for other times.

### You (2025-08-04T21:43:11.113Z)

It's sitting out of the 4th. Other times.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:43:16.472Z)

We need person who can kind of work from all the. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:43:21.993Z)

You bring up a really good point. Everybody's focused on AI. AI? What can we do with AI? Do we need somebody else to build AI? Why don't we, on this call on Friday, maybe put together maybe a timeline or.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:43:31.032Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:43:40.153Z)

Because when we go live, We're going to have to deal with all of those things that really aren't within Shivam and Raj's area. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:43:52.232Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:43:52.553Z)

They're going to have to keep focusing on writing code. Who is going to do the qa, who is going to handle the security in all these other things. So maybe that's what we need on this call, is to go through all these other positions that we're going to need just to keep this thing up and running. All right, that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:44:18.312Z)

Yeah. Feel free to involve wherever you feel. I think you do a great research. So if you want to involve anywhere in tech side. So I know you are saying about database.

### You (2025-08-04T21:44:26.713Z)

If you want. I know you're saying.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:44:33.352Z)

I just didn't want you to waste a lot of time on database. Because. I haven't. I did touch it.

### You (2025-08-04T21:44:40.153Z)

I did that during. I designed something.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:44:41.512Z)

And I designed something. Then I realized, no, the more work that needs to be done.

### You (2025-08-04T21:44:47.273Z)

Not.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:44:47.672Z)

Not sending the model to true yet because I know there's more to understand, more to do.

### You (2025-08-04T21:44:49.913Z)

Because I know this.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:44:55.432Z)

But, yeah, feel free to jump in over there. Maybe not.

### You (2025-08-04T21:44:56.793Z)

Database. Cool. So, yeah, other than those two little minor things that I added into the poc, I'm pretty much done with it. I haven't really done anything. I got all the screenshots. For Mark and Drew for their presentation. I know they use some this morning. I don't know if you read Mark's email yet. It was pretty good. Feedback that he.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:45:26.792Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:45:29.753Z)

But at this point, I'm going to pivot and focus on pricing. And all of that stuff that we've talked about before that we need to get lined up.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:45:44.072Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:45:44.153Z)

Before we can do anything.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:45:47.832Z)

Yeah. Really? We need to focus on that. And then probably, if you could also figure out how will onboard any user on our platform.

### You (2025-08-04T21:45:52.873Z)

On board. And use it on our platform. Yes.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:45:58.472Z)

What roles and how many user and all that. Then that would be great. So as soon as RMVP gets completed, probably we'll jump into that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:46:05.113Z)

We just completed.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:46:08.472Z)

Straight up so that if somebody wants to use mvp.

### You (2025-08-04T21:46:09.113Z)

So that somebody on the street was mvp.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:46:12.952Z)

You could just use code.

### You (2025-08-04T21:46:13.753Z)

I would love to make it as self serve as possible. Keep it simple. I think we need admin and user. We. We don't need a bunch of different roles. I would love to as part of the process. Get their job titles, but not nearly as detailed as what we had with Red iq. I just wonder, are you a broker? Are you an investor? Are you a lender? I mean, those different things. But I think a lot of this stuff, we could probably do a lot of self service onboarding. It's like, okay. Here's your username. And your temporary password. Go ahead and log in and take them from there. I don't know. What do you think? Do we need somebody? Like someone commits there.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:47:15.992Z)

Once someone creates their.

### You (2025-08-04T21:47:17.513Z)

Once they sign up.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:47:17.992Z)

Once they sign up, will eventually have to have some approval process, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:47:23.193Z)

That process.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:47:23.432Z)

Manual approval process. Otherwise, anyone who signs up will be able to log in.

### You (2025-08-04T21:47:25.113Z)

Anyone who signs out will be able to log in.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:47:28.472Z)

And I don't think we want that, right? We want to restrict that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:47:30.793Z)

Yeah. No, I think what we would have to do is there would still have to be somebody. I mean, typically, it'd be a salesperson. The Barns, they signed the agreement. Then they would create. The account in the system. And then create the admin user. But then I think at that point, then the admin user, they won't even have access to the URL data. I've only access to our marketing webpage. But then after they've signed the agreement, We would manually set up the account and the one user. I don't know. I think maybe once we get to that. Point, then that admin user could just create other users in their account.

But then that will also depend on our pricing model, right?

### You (2025-08-04T21:48:27.513Z)

Also depend on a pricing model, right? Where the different pricing model for how many users you can add.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:48:32.472Z)

Whether the different pricing model for how many users you can add or how many deals you can have. I don't know how that pricing model would look.

### You (2025-08-04T21:48:39.673Z)

I love that. Something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:48:44.472Z)

But something like that.

### You (2025-08-04T21:48:45.273Z)

Yeah. That's why I need to focus on that. And get something out there. I don't think we're going to make a decision. I'm going to just present options. But it seems like on all the calls. Mark brings up subscription. But subscription is dying out. It's a lot of people are pushing back against paying for something if they're not using it. Or out. So I think we have to come up with something that's more of a hybrid. But how? What are those things that we can add on or how do we determine usage? Is it logins or is it deals created? I mean, a lot of things we need to consider.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:49:35.272Z)

Yeah. That would be goody area to focus before we have something for you wherein you can check whether everything is working correctly.

### You (2025-08-04T21:49:38.233Z)

Before we have something for you can check whether things work behind it. For now.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:49:45.672Z)

At least for now. I think you'll have to do it.

### You (2025-08-04T21:49:45.833Z)

I think you have to do it.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:49:48.552Z)

Because you did a lot of work on POC so you understand how the entire thing works. And then if we decide to go with QA or somebody, then we'll say,

### You (2025-08-04T21:49:55.033Z)

Qa or somebody. Which reminds me. We're also going to have to make a decision on Pendo or Heap, which we want to use. So I'm going to have to get with the reps to get some pricing. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:17.192Z)

Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:50:17.753Z)

Yeah. Okay? All right. Yeah. So I'll take that as an action item as well. So, yeah, I think my focus now is going to be more on the administrative side. Cool. All right, I can do that. It's part of the job.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:37.752Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:50:40.873Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:41.112Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:50:41.513Z)

I'm sure this is not for you on the product side.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:41.832Z)

I'm sure there's a lot for you on the product side as well.

### You (2025-08-04T21:50:46.473Z)

But yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:47.272Z)

But yeah. I think for now, if we could just.

### You (2025-08-04T21:50:51.753Z)

Complete assignment, Pindi and full package.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:50:52.232Z)

Probably complete this MVP as a full pack as well as we have the onboarding, pricing, sales strategy, marketing and the product working.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:01.513Z)

Yeah. And I'm pushing back. I know Drew has asked for a couple of things. And I'm like, okay. That's a great idea. Let's see how our clients feel.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:51:12.152Z)

Yeah. I think you're been better on that. Front than me. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:18.793Z)

And he's been good about it. He hasn't really. No, we need to do this. He understands. He's coming around. To what product management is that we have to get user feedback.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:51:33.192Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:40.713Z)

All right. How's the family doing?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:51:42.952Z)

Of course. The family is doing great. My mom is also here now.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:49.353Z)

I was talking about that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:51:49.512Z)

I think I was talking about that. In the last Internet. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:53.993Z)

My mom came here on board.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:51:54.472Z)

My mom came here on 4th, so it's great. It's been almost a month now.

### You (2025-08-04T21:51:59.193Z)

Yeah. How long is she going to stay?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:05.512Z)

Return ticket. Is for January 2nd.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:07.513Z)

Okay? I know you don't make a trip that long.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:11.112Z)

Let's see.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:15.033Z)

And just get here and turn. I figured she'd be around for a little while.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:16.872Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:18.393Z)

That's cool. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:20.632Z)

Yeah. I mean, she loves to stay with us, and we'll allow her to be here as well.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:24.713Z)

To be here. As well. Just because of these biggest situations.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:26.952Z)

Just because of these visa situations.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:30.073Z)

What happens once a year.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:30.552Z)

It just happens once a year, like for six months.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:35.433Z)

Cool. All right. Anything else you wanted to touch base on?

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:42.472Z)

No, I think. I think everything is good.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:43.833Z)

Just keep you posting on the problem.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:43.992Z)

I'll just keep you guys posted. On the progress. For now, I have very solid thing to show or push on stage.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:51.193Z)

So that.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:51.432Z)

So that's why I haven't posted anything. But as soon as there's some good progress,

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:54.633Z)

Some good progress.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:52:57.112Z)

Keep you guys posted.

### You (2025-08-04T21:52:57.513Z)

Okay? I pinged out your hand to find out what time on Friday works for her. I haven't heard back yet. So as soon as I do, I'll send out the invite. For Friday. Or wait. Do I? Oh, no. That's her Thursday call. Okay? I thought. I had to switch my computer around because the light in the window was too bright. So I have not got to look around the side there to see what's on the calendar. All right, cool.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:53:30.792Z)

Out of the showing. Go with that. Positive.

### You (2025-08-04T21:53:33.673Z)

It went really well. A lady come in last week.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:53:43.432Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-04T21:53:44.713Z)

And the first time she was here. She said she was looking for her daughter. And so she was, like, probably 75, 80 years old. I think she wanted to find something kind of like for the family just to come and hang out. And then she came back on Saturday for another showing, and she called or her realtor called ours and said she's interested. In buying the property, and would we consider a contingency offer? And it's like, I'm not going to take a contingency offer. Because that means you have to take it off the market. While we wait for her to sell her place. So we know that this one person who's ready. And then the people today, I believe, When they made the appointment, his agent said that he's an investor in Short Term Rentals. So he's looking at it for, like, an Airbnb.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:54:45.432Z)

Well thought.

### You (2025-08-04T21:54:47.033Z)

I kind of went and stood outside. So I didn't make him feel uncomfortable. So they could go ahead and talk. But I did hear somebody or did hear him say, like, well, you could put something over here. Right. So, I mean, if they're. If they're figuring out where to place furniture, they got to be somewhat interested. Hopefully we'll see. But I am not going to take a loss on it. I'm not going to come out of pocket.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:55:10.472Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-04T21:55:13.593Z)

To get rid of it. We'll see. That's a good side.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:55:18.792Z)

Cool. That's a good sign.

### You (2025-08-04T21:55:19.433Z)

Yeah. We'll see how it goes. All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:55:28.792Z)

Yeah. So you don't want to animating then? Yeah. All. Team meeting. Yeah. All right.

### You (2025-08-04T21:55:34.073Z)

Okay, we'll see.

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:55:34.392Z)

Bye.

### You (2025-08-04T21:55:34.553Z)

### Guest (2025-08-04T21:55:36.072Z)
