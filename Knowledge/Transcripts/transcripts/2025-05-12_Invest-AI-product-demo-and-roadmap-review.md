### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:34.768Z)

So, Ginny, we wanted to demo real quick unless

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:36.376Z)

Demo real quick unless someone wants to go first.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:39.228Z)

wants to go fast.

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:40.776Z)

Because I might have to drop or

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:41.918Z)

Might have to drop or

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:43.436Z)

something like that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:43.698Z)

something like that. Yeah. Sounds good. Yep.

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:45.126Z)

Yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. Love to see it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:48.588Z)

Yeah. I mean,

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:50.696Z)

Yeah. I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:51.888Z)

no. It's not where I wanted it to be or probably we wanted it to be, I did a lot of work

### You (2025-05-12T17:33:58.656Z)

work.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:33:59.548Z)

for sure. Made some good progress.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:00.026Z)

We made some good progress. So the thing about this is so we need to create the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:03.038Z)

So the thing about this is we need to create the user and account management first before we

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:12.116Z)

10.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:12.508Z)

can do the deals. Right? Because each deal is assigned to an

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:12.516Z)

To attend the trial, but each tier is assigned to an account and the user

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:16.368Z)

account and the user.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:18.686Z)

So I have to do that first, like, kind of, in the real effect, but

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:19.118Z)

So I have to do that first so I can't derailed a bit, but I think I made some good progress there. So we have the

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:22.466Z)

I think I've made some good progress there. So we have the the log in page working here.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:26.068Z)

login page working here. Let's log in.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:29.546Z)

Let's log in. Hang on. This is a general

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:31.548Z)

And then this is a generic dashboard. The teaming is

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:33.476Z)

that. Board. Team is yet to be worked on by

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:36.838Z)

yet to be worked on, but you will see some buttons are not visible. There's create

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:38.436Z)

some buttons are not

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:41.208Z)

create new all deal. And things like this.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:44.526Z)

like this. I need to do a lot of work here.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:47.038Z)

I still need to do a lot of work here.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:48.676Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:49.218Z)

But

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:49.376Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:50.118Z)

yeah, few things are there.

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:50.196Z)

A few things are there. So that went down.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:52.618Z)

That and then Howard did a lot of great work on creating the new deal

### You (2025-05-12T17:34:53.086Z)

How did how did work on currently? In your day?

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:34:57.188Z)

and he passed it over to me. So that was super helpful. So we have all these steps

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:00.156Z)

So we have these steps

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:02.998Z)

created in here in the app itself.

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:03.376Z)

train it. In to end

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:06.478Z)

Till the end. For the POC, however, since, you know, we are not

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:10.856Z)

just extracting

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:12.548Z)

extracting the data from the documents, what I've done right now

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:16.816Z)

If I'm getting the data directly from the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:17.688Z)

is I'm fetching the data directly from the

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:20.306Z)

database. This is the same data that I'm providing. So if you see any

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:20.648Z)

database. This is the same data that Drew provided. So if you see when

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:24.706Z)

type hotel,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:25.018Z)

I typed hotel,

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:25.686Z)

so it will

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:26.208Z)

so it drew, like, it

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:27.756Z)

it gave me all the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:28.378Z)

gave me all the

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:28.896Z)

the list.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:30.048Z)

list of the hotels that are just in our database right now.

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:34.946Z)

If I say repair,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:34.958Z)

If I say fair,

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:36.766Z)

so

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:37.308Z)

so it'll kind of create that drop down with fair. It also gives me the address of the property. When I clicks on this,

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:45.196Z)

this

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:45.708Z)

this should basically fetch all the details from the database.

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:46.036Z)

basically fit all the details

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:49.758Z)

And create that deal

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:50.276Z)

with the for me.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:51.888Z)

for me based on

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:52.346Z)

On the data we already have in database. It's gonna go there. It's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:53.498Z)

the data we already have in database. It's gonna go there. It's big big hiccup.

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:59.146Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:35:59.608Z)

There. It's creating that deal.

### You (2025-05-12T17:35:59.646Z)

It's great. So that

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:02.148Z)

So that we are free field one, that investment is

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:02.766Z)

yeah. Great. Feel the advertisement is time frame of their

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:06.428Z)

I'll show that by seeing the core right now. So that deal is created here.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:10.846Z)

So that getting here. So we caught some of the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:13.608Z)

We got some of the

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:14.776Z)

details.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:15.298Z)

details.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:16.056Z)

This data is definitely not correct. I missed the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:16.558Z)

This data is definitely not correct. I'm still

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:20.106Z)

working on this.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:20.628Z)

working on this. But it looks something like this.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:24.266Z)

This. The one time and after five is

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:25.278Z)

The one is that. Then other part is delisting page. So if I go back one second. Okay.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:29.776Z)

the existing data

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:33.488Z)

So I'm not gonna Internet here, so I'm just

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:34.586Z)

Some router interconnect.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:38.368Z)

connected through my mobile's Internet. So it's gonna be a bit slow. Okay.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:47.016Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:47.528Z)

So in recent deal, now we see three deals instead of

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:50.056Z)

two. But

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:50.618Z)

two. But this is basically our deal list page. Of course, I need to change these columns.

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:54.146Z)

it's a what I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:56.748Z)

And, you know, we'll show all the

### You (2025-05-12T17:36:57.746Z)

so

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:36:59.588Z)

deals here. We'll see whatever details we want in that table.

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:00.376Z)

see whatever it is we want in that in

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:03.778Z)

Then, you know, we can always

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:04.006Z)

we can always

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:05.358Z)

view the deal based on that. The account management part here, so that's created too, but it's

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:11.696Z)

So that's gonna be a no worries.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:14.128Z)

currently breaking. So if I click on that, it's gonna break, so I'll not go there. But I have the account. There's user management section created. I was just actively working, so it's kind of in progress.

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:23.646Z)

And

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:25.848Z)

And then we have some some progress made on other parts.

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:27.636Z)

some progress we make. Partners. So let's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:32.158Z)

So let's

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:33.806Z)

see.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:34.288Z)

see. That is working.

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:35.066Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:35.718Z)

Okay. That's breaking. So let's ignore that one now.

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:37.006Z)

That's great. So I can say not that. So, yeah,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:39.878Z)

So, yeah, basically, we have the some progress made on the deal creation, deal list, deal details. And then I'll basically map all the deal

### You (2025-05-12T17:37:54.696Z)

one.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:37:55.398Z)

part to our model, which is would be the next high priority for me. That's amazing. So the next step then is to be able to, like, take that and pull it into, like, an actual

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:04.596Z)

To be able to, like, take that pool into, an actual, like, p and l. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:07.768Z)

like, p and l. Right? And and with the underwriting assumptions and things like that.

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:08.786Z)

And the underwriting assumptions and things like that. Yes. So I'll fix

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:12.008Z)

Yes. So all these d deal creation that data that we gather from the user or that we have in the database will eventually end up in our model.

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:22.876Z)

And we have

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:23.678Z)

And we have the logic already written in the model for

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:26.816Z)

in the last part

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:27.358Z)

in the logic part.

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:29.946Z)

So, basically, that's all.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:30.508Z)

So, basically, that's all this all

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:32.026Z)

It's all is gonna go.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:34.058Z)

gonna go.

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:34.386Z)

Yeah. So so, Diane, just to clarify, most of what you see here is coming from what you would input, but there's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:38:43.598Z)

Mhmm. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:38:43.666Z)

other than there's there's Drew's data here as well. But that exercise that I went through where I changed cell references to named ranges, that's one of the next things that we need to do is I need to then go through and, help Vinod actually create some of the calculated fields and some of the calculations based on those formulas. And translated into database language, essentially. So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:13.668Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:16.456Z)

Yeah. That looks so good. I can

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:18.288Z)

That looks so good. I can't believe we actually I mean, we're this far. Right? We're making

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:19.776Z)

can't believe we actually were this far. Right? We're making progress.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:22.898Z)

progress. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:25.256Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:25.698Z)

Yeah. I think this weekend is was a bit productive for me.

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:25.966Z)

It's always productive Yeah. Yeah. I just

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:29.818Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:34.538Z)

Yeah. So, basically, this is where we are, and I'm expecting to have the model. Right?

Now

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:44.048Z)

That's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:47.178Z)

trying to do.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:48.868Z)

trying to do.

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:49.396Z)

Okay. That's great.

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:51.868Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:52.216Z)

I know you guys have requested

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:52.638Z)

I know you guys had requested, like, us

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:55.296Z)

like, us to upload

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:56.438Z)

to upload

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:57.366Z)

OM

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:39:57.898Z)

OMs and stuff like that. So I did go through and try to find any

### You (2025-05-12T17:39:59.196Z)

like that. So I did go through and try to find any ON

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:02.388Z)

OM or

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:02.646Z)

or investor deck.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:04.028Z)

investor pitch deck or anything like that that I had.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:05.536Z)

That I had. Unfortunately, I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:07.798Z)

Unfortunately, I don't have a ton of that stuff because it's all with companies, you know, and not in my

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:08.466Z)

that stuff because it's all with companies, you know, I'm not in my personal possession.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:12.738Z)

But hopefully, some of it helps you if you need to try to play around with extreme

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:13.316Z)

But hopefully some of it helps you. You need to try to play around extracting data from

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:17.498Z)

extracting data from

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:18.936Z)

PDF.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:19.388Z)

PDF documents.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:20.826Z)

Yeah. We did actually move

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:21.328Z)

We did actually go go through that last week.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:22.956Z)

do that last week. So that's in

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:24.798Z)

But that and that'll that'll fall into the category, Howard,

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:25.636Z)

that's all of it again. Great. Howard, We start last week and then

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:28.148Z)

but we discussed last week, I think.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:30.966Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:33.308Z)

Yeah. Drew did provide a lot of files, so which is great. But Right now, I'm not actually work on that. So whenever that comes through from your side too, and that'll be great.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:41.726Z)

Well, we got

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:44.558Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:44.986Z)

files from Drew, but were they actual broker packages, OMs, things that the a broker would send to an investor

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:51.688Z)

Those were not

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:53.146Z)

Those were not

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:56.158Z)

things those were not OMs.

### You (2025-05-12T17:40:56.406Z)

those were not o m.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:40:58.558Z)

But they would be in they would they would be included. Like, if you're gonna go you know, buy a hotel, you're gonna get one of those files. That's a it's a basic profit and loss statement. Right? So that's like a that's gonna be the second thing you get after the OA, probably.

### You (2025-05-12T17:41:10.526Z)

Yeah. To deal with. Right. So what we would be looking for is something along the lines of the marketing package. Where they would send out a PDF typically a book, at least on the multifamily side, which will contain all sorts of stuff. It'll contain the write up in the description of the property and history and well as, you know, some high level overview.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:41:40.918Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-12T17:41:42.546Z)

Mhmm. I had about

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:41:43.818Z)

I I had about four or five of them that I could upload.

### You (2025-05-12T17:41:44.796Z)

four or five of them that I could upload. All

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:41:47.708Z)

They're old. They're but I don't think it matters. Right? It's just you're just looking to try to

### You (2025-05-12T17:41:50.076Z)

It's like Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:41:52.488Z)

right, scrape it. Yep.

### You (2025-05-12T17:41:52.996Z)

To see what what information is there, what format it is. Yeah. Because we can we can extract some information directly off of those as well.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:03.498Z)

I also sent you

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:05.016Z)

You know, I've done the initial setup by a by a client, by a user. I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:11.948Z)

also sent you a pitch deck, and I feel like it's okay to send this because

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:12.666Z)

pitch deck. I feel like because it's a company

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:16.228Z)

it's a company that I worked for that doesn't

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:16.706Z)

that work for. Doesn't. Exist in our travel.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:18.918Z)

exist and have a whole hotel platform anymore. But it was our pitch

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:19.586Z)

Hotel platform But with our pitch deck,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:23.138Z)

deck when we were taking, like, eight assets out to capitalize.

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:23.656Z)

like out to capitalize. And I think it's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:27.588Z)

And I think it's important because

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:27.886Z)

important because our platform

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:29.888Z)

our platform, like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:30.126Z)

platform like, I hope that

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:31.578Z)

I hope that

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:32.756Z)

people, like, clients

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:33.338Z)

people like our clients

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:35.276Z)

be able to pull us

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:35.748Z)

be able to pull this data up, underwrite it. Right? And then be able to create their own pitch book

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:36.286Z)

data up. Under Right? Be able to creep down

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:40.358Z)

and send it out to 30 or 40, you know, groups

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:41.586Z)

30 or 40 know, groups since they're trying to capitalize it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:44.038Z)

as they're trying to capitalize it. So you'll see that in there

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:45.216Z)

So see that in there as well. It'll be like, this doesn't look like an o m.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:47.448Z)

well. You'll be like, this doesn't look like an OM, but it was actually

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:49.276Z)

It was actually

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:50.858Z)

Ultima's pitch book that we used.

### You (2025-05-12T17:42:51.786Z)

book that we used. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:42:55.398Z)

Sounds good. And then I did play a little bit with the logo too, and I was not very satisfied with the other one. Oh. This is one of the options.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:04.286Z)

That options.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:06.568Z)

Probably a little better than the previous version.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:09.126Z)

Oh, it's great.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:09.748Z)

That looks great.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:10.456Z)

Yeah. I like that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:11.408Z)

Yeah. Well, so, yeah, we could probably use that. It's very symmetrical. Or almost symmetrical. It's like how the bars

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:20.856Z)

Amp up and then

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:21.678Z)

amp up and then so it looks great mode. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:22.216Z)

So that's great. So, Vinod, when you're when you're finished with it, you help a copy of that into the team site so that we can kinda have a

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:30.748Z)

Sure. Sure. Sure.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:32.936Z)

Sure. Sure. Source where everybody can access it for

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:34.838Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:36.636Z)

presentations.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:39.168Z)

Sounds good.

### You (2025-05-12T17:43:40.406Z)

Sounds good. Yep. Cool. Looks good. That's all.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:43:42.178Z)

Yeah. That's all I have, guys. You Howard, do you need anything else from us? Because you it sounds like you guys are gonna work on the continuing this forward. Do you have what you need as far as the the workflow and the formulas and

### You (2025-05-12T17:44:00.916Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I I do. I think

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:44:01.938Z)

and and all that?

### You (2025-05-12T17:44:04.186Z)

you know, as long as everybody feels that that sample model that was uploaded is correct. You know, I'm just going to use the calculations off of there. Need to work with the note on there. So I I don't know, you know, when he set up his database, if he used the same field names that I did in that spreadsheet. And if not, you know, just wanna make sure that we have the the correct mapping of of those fields. And then we can go ahead and get started on that. One of the other things I need to work with Monota on is and I would like to get a list of what are as comprehensive as possible, what are the other departments? What are the other other operated expenses, other operated revenues? So I know we got food and beverage. We've got banquet. What else? Would there be gift shops or

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:05.098Z)

Spa, golf, Yeah. Yeah. That in

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:08.646Z)

Go ahead, George. Sorry.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:08.998Z)

yep. Go ahead, Drew. I'm sorry.

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:10.096Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:10.698Z)

That's what went into that

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:11.486Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:12.128Z)

Right? Like, the way that summary p and l page. Right? It always has rooms, food and beverage, other operated, and miscellaneous.

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:19.226Z)

Yeah. So and and, like,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:20.058Z)

So and and, like, rooms is, you know,

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:23.136Z)

So categorically

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:24.358Z)

categorically, it's

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:25.086Z)

just

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:25.808Z)

just the the rooms that you're selling. And any fees associated with that, food and beverage is just your your restaurants. Yeah. It could could be a bar. It could be a restaurant, could be banquet catering, all that. And then other operator, it's gonna include all the other stuff that we were talking about. So in in that and and I think in in our system, we have, like, 20 different other operated departments.

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:47.276Z)

Yeah. I see. Okay. I didn't the note, I didn't know you actually Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:48.258Z)

Right. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:50.806Z)

In the database now. Okay. Good. Because, yeah, we're gonna have a analysis by which

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:45:51.658Z)

So I understand.

### You (2025-05-12T17:45:55.776Z)

you know, when the user is setting it up, if they have no other operated, you know, we don't even want that page to pop up.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:01.438Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:02.976Z)

You know? But if they have five different categories, we wanna make sure we capture all five. Where they can then go ahead and input their assumptions. So okay. So so we've got that. Edge, you got

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:15.508Z)

Should include Roy's Dorothy as well.

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:16.806Z)

Edge

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:17.528Z)

Another one. What what was that, Mark?

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:20.766Z)

we start

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:21.428Z)

Resort fee? Yeah. And that would be in miscellaneous. I I explained to Howard, but no kinda the difference between But it's the

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:28.766Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:29.388Z)

So could be online item. A big item. Oh, go. BSB like, get its own line item? Sorry, Mark. You broke up a little bit there. Sorry.

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:42.906Z)

Sorry. Sorry. But, yeah,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:47.518Z)

Yeah, I I would get

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:48.036Z)

I'll try that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:48.698Z)

online item if you wanted another I think, yeah, I think what

### You (2025-05-12T17:46:53.166Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:46:54.558Z)

earliest what what I was imagining is it would be you know, we you'd have miscellaneous as a as a department, and then, you know, if

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:01.306Z)

Like doing

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:01.968Z)

like, doing it the kind of line by line, like, fees or cancellation attrition, all that stuff would be in, a breakout tab.

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:08.416Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:16.738Z)

Jumping back to food and beverage, one frustration from people who tried these platforms like this a decade ago

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:21.386Z)

Like this a decade ago? Was that

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:24.048Z)

was that the outlets didn't like, if there were multiple

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:24.836Z)

outlet let go

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:27.968Z)

restaurants in a hotel, was just like outlet one, outlet two, outlet three, and it didn't have a name at

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:30.436Z)

one. Outlet two. Name associated

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:34.898Z)

associated. I just wanted to mention that. I don't know if that's solvable for us, but I heard a lot of people complain about not being able to, like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:42.286Z)

to, like, understand

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:44.018Z)

understand which out which food and beverage outlet was which

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:44.076Z)

which how food fiber chocolate is which food fiber chocolate

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:47.188Z)

and beverage outlet because they weren't labeled.

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:47.446Z)

because they work. Lethal.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:49.928Z)

Very well. I mean, that's

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:54.036Z)

I mean,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:55.468Z)

something that we like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:55.556Z)

we like. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:47:56.988Z)

yeah, every operator has

### You (2025-05-12T17:47:59.476Z)

You know, like,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:00.138Z)

you know, like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:00.246Z)

restaurant, like, two three.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:01.048Z)

restaurant one, two, three, four, outlet one, two, three, four, whatever. Right? And it says, you know, that's, like, what the name of it is. That's a like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:11.036Z)

Hotels,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:11.818Z)

hotel it's a very hotel specific thing.

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:13.086Z)

specific. Thing. It's not

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:15.988Z)

It's not usually listed in the data anywhere.

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:19.826Z)

But even

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:20.728Z)

Like, even in the data that we get.

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:22.046Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:22.758Z)

Right? Like, the the hotel rest hotel or the restaurant names weren't included anywhere from, like, a data point of view.

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:30.976Z)

And we're all

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:31.918Z)

That's probably something we could do at

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:34.956Z)

Yeah. I you know, adding a field, which should just be

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:48:35.628Z)

setup maybe. Like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:48:39.926Z)

you know, the metadata. Well, I'm there. We you know, in our database, there's always gonna be you know, restaurant one, restaurant two, restaurant three. But we could allow the user to add a name for the restaurant one, right, and restaurant two in the model so that I mean, that makes sense to me. If I were underwriting a hotel, but I'm not exactly familiar with which one they say is hotel and I could know that, you know, okay. This is the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:49:07.298Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-05-12T17:49:09.186Z)

Starbucks kiosk. This is whatever. So, yeah, I can I can see where the person who's, you know, the the business analyst or the person who's trying to come up with valuation would get a lot of use out of that? So shouldn't be shouldn't be difficult at all.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:49:28.168Z)

I think and and we've talked we were talking last week about difference between somebody, right, that's using this that already owns a hotel So, you know, they're getting data

### You (2025-05-12T17:49:41.076Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:49:41.888Z)

theoretically, like, in conjunction with our company with Hotel BIS. Right? So data's much more granular, and it's flowing through every month as month they close and forecast are updated. Which would be different from if somebody was opening a new deal of a hotel that they're gonna buy

### You (2025-05-12T17:49:55.636Z)

On a health

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:49:58.408Z)

and they just got data from the from the broker. Right, that's gonna be a sort of a different you're gonna get a different level of granularity. Right? You're gonna

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:04.646Z)

be

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:07.308Z)

that data is gonna come from a p and l that is gonna have to be either manually entered or scraped or some combination thereof. And

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:16.216Z)

I guess,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:17.068Z)

I guess

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:18.146Z)

what you're

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:19.258Z)

when you're scraping the data

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:21.256Z)

Like, if you flip this,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:22.558Z)

like, initially, it's gonna be summary level.

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:22.896Z)

something

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:24.718Z)

And then you'll add more granularity as you, you know,

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:28.496Z)

you know, work through it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:29.968Z)

work through additional rounds of underwriting, I guess. But

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:31.586Z)

But Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:33.698Z)

yeah,

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:34.156Z)

And that level, I've

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:35.058Z)

at that level, I would think, yeah, it would be from, like I guess, I'm thinking, like, the department like, in that table, the department table. Right? You had I guess we'd have to have a separate

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:44.826Z)

separate

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:46.208Z)

maybe an alias name or something like that. Know, to you're keeping the matching, but also allowing for uniqueness.

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:51.656Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I think where I'm going with this is I'm looking at it more from an

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:50:52.438Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-12T17:50:57.016Z)

acquisitions standpoint. And from the multifamily perspective, there's always options with rooms. Right? I might have two maybe a building that just has studios. You know, no bedroom, just living room, kitchen, small sleeping area. But I might have a demand in that neighborhood for two know, for for either full one bedrooms or even two bedrooms. So I can knock down a wall. Right? So my my rooms or my my unit makeup would would change. So instead of having two studios, now I've got one whatever I did. Right? So I'm thinking kind of would there be a possibility in the hotel space where, you know, maybe maybe there is a Starbucks kiosk and something else and something else. Would they say, well, you know, I don't want all

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:51:48.688Z)

In the homes.

### You (2025-05-12T17:51:57.116Z)

three of these. Maybe I wanna consolidate into a bigger dining area or something like that. At which case, then being able to split about you know because I'm the business analyst. I don't own that property, but I'm thinking about buying it. That that's the kind of the scenario where I think to be able to to label Starbucks here. And then when I'm Right. Crunching the numbers in the model,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:15.638Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:19.886Z)

I know which one I'm talking about. That that's really the only scenario I can come up with where that would be

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:24.818Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:27.026Z)

Got it. Helpful. But, I mean, if yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:29.968Z)

Done. Right.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:30.526Z)

We got users that want something like that. That's that's really not it's not difficult at all.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:35.328Z)

And I know I mentioned this before,

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:36.366Z)

And I know before, but because I'm really working

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:39.638Z)

just because I'm literally working on it this week, and it's so real world to me.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:40.686Z)

on it this week, and it's so real world. It

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:44.888Z)

Is the my part time job

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:45.376Z)

job the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:47.138Z)

the company is thinking they're going through a hold cell.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:47.946Z)

is thinking, they're going through a wholesale analysis. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:51.448Z)

Analysis. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:52.266Z)

And so step one,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:53.128Z)

And so step one, we analyze and do an internal

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:53.836Z)

we analyze do internal evaluation ourselves.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:57.528Z)

evaluation ourselves.

### You (2025-05-12T17:52:58.976Z)

Step two,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:52:59.848Z)

Step two, we get two or three brokers to

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:00.356Z)

we get two or three burns to actually give us a broker opinion of value.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:03.528Z)

actually give us a broker opinion of value.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:06.336Z)

So, this is where the whole process is so manual. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:06.998Z)

So this is where the whole process is so manual. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:10.006Z)

I have to go through

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:11.048Z)

I have to go through the the confidentiality agreement got emailed back

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:11.526Z)

it. Media. It's on the got emailed back and forth, like, six times.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:15.988Z)

and forth, like, six times.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:16.896Z)

Now I have to upload Excel and PDF files.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:18.188Z)

Now I have to upload Excel and PDF files.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:21.086Z)

To CBRE's website.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:22.108Z)

To CBRE's website

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:23.306Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:24.268Z)

Right? Then they're gonna take it and put it in a model and generate a BOV.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:24.786Z)

Take it. Put it in a model, generate the VOB, I have I have an internal one that we

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:29.128Z)

I have a have an internal one that we've done that we're gonna compare it to.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:31.236Z)

don't. That we're gonna compare it to. But then same time,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:34.008Z)

But then at the same time, we're reaching out to

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:34.846Z)

we're reaching out to our existing lender about an extension

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:37.028Z)

our existing lender about an extension

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:39.316Z)

We're be talking to other lenders about it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:40.108Z)

We may be talking to other lenders about a new refi.

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:42.106Z)

New refi. It's it's like, does that make sense? It's like an open I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:44.178Z)

It's it's like, does that make sense? It's like an oh, and I can just and this is an HEI managed

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:46.006Z)

just and this is an AGI managed hotel. So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:48.608Z)

hotel. So it would be so easy to just say HEI release this information to Invest AI to Drew. Right? Like, just

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:49.596Z)

it would be so easy to just say, AGI released this information to InvestAI through your right. Like, Like, just release release And then it's

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:53:58.498Z)

release it. And then it sits in Invest AI,

### You (2025-05-12T17:53:59.916Z)

sits in and does down. I and then we

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:02.058Z)

and then we can route it to all of these people so that we've saved everyone

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:02.226Z)

can run it to all these people so that we've saved everything. Hours and hours Oh, yeah. Of time. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:07.048Z)

hours and hours of of time.

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:10.156Z)

Perfect. So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:10.348Z)

work for me this week. I've literally gone through the pain. Of uploading.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:19.388Z)

of uploading files to a Dropbox.

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:19.816Z)

Five. To a Dropbox or CBRE to send them. To you know and our and our lender, I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:22.408Z)

For CBRE and to sending them to know? And our and our lenders saying calling us saying,

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:26.716Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:28.928Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:35.378Z)

It's like, we can, like I I just keep thinking we can provide. We invest

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:36.846Z)

I I just think we can provide. The best AI provide all of it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:40.348Z)

AI, can provide all of this and save so many people

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:41.256Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:43.968Z)

so much time.

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:44.996Z)

Yeah. And it definitely

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:46.278Z)

And is that something you're thinking you would, like, ask the broker to use

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:47.086Z)

thinking type? After the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:51.248Z)

the underwriting part of Invest AI to to do

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:51.966Z)

first Like, for

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:55.428Z)

like, from where you're positioned right where you're sitting right now. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:54:57.776Z)

if you have system to model, would you

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:54:58.688Z)

if you had the system were all built, would you

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:00.166Z)

try to have the CEO

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:01.328Z)

try to ask CBRE and the lender and others to, like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:04.216Z)

use the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:05.128Z)

use the system to, like, do their underwriting, or would you expect they would set you know, do it on their send something back?

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:10.036Z)

I said I

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:10.998Z)

I say, I think initially, they're gonna hold on to their

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:11.396Z)

think, initially, they're gonna hold on to their cell model, and they're not gonna want

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:14.408Z)

Excel model, and they're not gonna wanna let it go. But if we build a

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:15.346Z)

let it go. If we build a good enough

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:18.958Z)

good enough AVM that it's actually

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:18.976Z)

80, that it's actually easier for them

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:22.188Z)

easier for them to underwrite in our model or maybe has more depth

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:22.366Z)

to underwrite and our loan or maybe has more depth or, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:26.688Z)

or you know what I mean? Because,

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:27.296Z)

Because because sometimes

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:29.438Z)

because sometimes you wanna get into it. Like, let's just take food and beverage. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:29.626Z)

you wanna get it, like, let's just take credit card and try it. You wanna get

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:33.598Z)

You wanna get into a department and you really do need a

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:33.706Z)

the department and you really do need a quickly break it out into outlets and to events.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:36.708Z)

quickly break it out into outlets and to events.

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:39.366Z)

Because events are so much more profitable. Right? And so you

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:40.328Z)

Because events are so much more profitable. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:43.456Z)

know, you're

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:43.588Z)

And so you, you know, you're playing around with that, and it's a very manual

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:43.986Z)

playing around with that in a sort manual if you have to do it, you know, with Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:47.418Z)

if you have to do it, you know, with Excel. So my I I think

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:49.256Z)

So my I I think what will happen in

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:52.238Z)

what will happen, and I'm this is probably what's happening on the multifamily space is

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:52.496Z)

I'm this is probably what's happening on the multifamily space is Initially,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:55:56.848Z)

Initially, it looks a lot like Red IQ. Right? Where may where maybe the

### You (2025-05-12T17:55:56.946Z)

looks a lot like Red IQ. Right? Where maybe the only is

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:01.278Z)

only difference is we have the ability the owner, right,

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:01.526Z)

the ability to right, and who's frontier here says

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:05.108Z)

who's Frontier here says, oh, HEI, we release you to send this information. To CBRE, JLL, blah blah, you know,

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:06.006Z)

oh, he got we will see you to send this information. CBRE. JLL. Blah blah blah, you know, new, you know, potential lenders.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:14.768Z)

new new, you know, new potential lenders.

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:17.336Z)

And they can release

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:18.268Z)

And then they can release it, and it can transfer through

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:19.486Z)

it can transfer through us and directly

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:22.688Z)

us and directly into

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:23.846Z)

into whoever

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:25.578Z)

whoever needs to underwrite it. Their

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:25.616Z)

to underwrite it. They're model.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:28.078Z)

models. And then a year or a year and a half, two years from now, our model gets

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:28.146Z)

And then a year a year and a half, two years from now, our model gets so good.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:32.748Z)

so good.

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:32.906Z)

And some real AI capability in it.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:33.868Z)

Maybe we do have some real AI capability in it,

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:36.056Z)

That they prefer on the right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:37.048Z)

they would prefer to underwrite.

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:37.906Z)

In our system

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:38.838Z)

In our system

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:39.346Z)

on online.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:40.388Z)

on online. Or that they have customers, the CBRE or whoever's you know, their customers

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:43.096Z)

Receiver. Whoever's feed other customers themselves. Right? So it's not more of a network. You would Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:46.098Z)

themselves. Right? So it becomes more of a network. Utilization rather than

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:48.526Z)

Probably. You know, customer. Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:56:50.088Z)

individual customer. Right.

### You (2025-05-12T17:56:53.006Z)

Yeah. And that's related to the workflow that I shared before where where a broker could create a model. And then they could just share it. Right? They could check a box, the email address of who it is they wanna share it. The email goes out there, says click this link to get access. And now they've got the model. You know, going shared there as well. Which yeah. At Literally, at the push of a button, you could send that out to multiple people. Right? If they wanted to share it with one person or if they wanted to share it with a hundred. Yeah. I think you can send it back to us, and then we could create a really quick comparison to the

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:30.238Z)

They could even send it back to us, and then we could create a really quick comparison to the internal model that was done.

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:34.136Z)

model that was done. Right? Because most people are doing, like, I have

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:36.638Z)

Right? Because most people are doing like, I that's what I have

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:38.196Z)

what I object. To an internal evaluation.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:39.658Z)

do. I have to do an internal valuation at the same time we're sending it out to them. And so

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:40.776Z)

Same time. We're sending it out. To them. And so once they're done with

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:44.628Z)

once they're done with it,

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:44.856Z)

it, send back to us in a nice

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:46.408Z)

would send it back to us in a nice little

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:47.286Z)

little PDF pack

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:48.768Z)

PDF package.

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:48.936Z)

Yep. But

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:50.508Z)

It would be so much better if they could just send it back and with a couple of clicks

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:50.586Z)

better than you just send it back. Couple of clicks. We could say, oh,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:54.458Z)

we could say, oh, the main difference is they assumed ADR growth of

### You (2025-05-12T17:57:54.596Z)

it may difference. It assumed ADR growth. 5% more than we did or so, you know, and it just becomes Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:57:59.428Z)

you know, 5% more than we did or you know? And it just becomes yep.

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:03.476Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:04.338Z)

Sorry. I didn't need to derail the

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:08.326Z)

It's I guess, right on the right line there.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:09.308Z)

conversation on that.

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:12.176Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:16.888Z)

Cool. Alright. Well and and Howard and Vinod, what were you guys thinking of pull like, I guess or I guess, let us know when you look at the ON that Diane sent. I don't really have any of those, unfortunately, so I cannot supplement what she has has added. But let us know what you think what information you think you would glean like, we would pull try to pull from that I don't know how consistent they are

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:46.766Z)

Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:47.768Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:48.476Z)

it it like, I have an idea

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:49.628Z)

like, I feel like from in my mind, you're gonna get more from the p and l, but I guess the OM has a lot of other data.

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:56.086Z)

know, let us know what you think would be useful there. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:56.138Z)

So let us know what you think would be useful there.

### You (2025-05-12T17:58:59.016Z)

Yeah. Same thing multifamily. Every broker or every

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:58:59.058Z)

We try to get more. Can you

### You (2025-05-12T17:59:04.856Z)

account. Would be different. Right? You might have some consistency within, like, the big institutional players, but, you know, you get the little mom and pop or the mid size and every broker can put together their own OM. But what would be nice, especially when we get into the point where we can start utilizing AI, is to take a lot of the text and a lot of the descriptions that are in there and compare them and, you know, use that, you know, because one of the things I would love to have also is at the end of the day, when they're done using the model and they're they're set on evaluation, would love to have them push a button

### Guest (2025-05-12T17:59:48.528Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T17:59:49.156Z)

and it just prints out a package. Right? Yeah. Of of their own. You know? Print out a LOI, print out whatever they wanna have. Whatever they need to go to their investment committee, right? If they have to go back and go to their partners, a lot of things you could do with that information as well as, like you say, don't typically get all the line items, but you might have a total revenue, total expense, you know, whatever the broker comes up with and feels that it's worth. But, yeah, they will all be different formats. So it's something we would definitely have to use AI for to kinda scan through and look for keywords and things like that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:00:27.978Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T18:00:29.886Z)

Yeah. One question I had too when we were talking about uploading the data. You know, I've I've mentioned before, I think, you know, I've got my sights set on replace yeah. Competing with the STI report. STAR report. Because we're we're gonna be getting the exact same data. From our users as what they supply. So my question is if I think it's highly unlikely, but I gotta ask. Is there anything that you're aware of in the CoStar agreements, that is basically telling the users that they cannot share that data with somebody else. Right? I I can't imagine that CoStar would say, okay, you know, you give me your p and l's, but you can't share it with anybody else. I mean, the it belongs to the to the client, to the user.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:01:32.258Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T18:01:34.376Z)

To begin with. Yeah. So so

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:01:36.898Z)

You so the the way SDRs terms of service work are

### You (2025-05-12T18:01:39.116Z)

So work. Are

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:01:41.838Z)

you can share you you I mean, once you share your data with

### You (2025-05-12T18:01:43.536Z)

I mean, once you

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:01:46.518Z)

STR and STR does stuff with it, or, you know, CoStar does stuff with it, whatever is reproduced becomes STR You know, they they own that. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T18:01:53.156Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:01:58.168Z)

But the original source data, you know, your own p and l's from your own accounting system or forecasting system, whatever, like, that is still yours, and you are free to share it in in any way that you want.

### You (2025-05-12T18:02:07.596Z)

That was my assumption. I didn't think it would be limited, but

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:02:10.458Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T18:02:11.716Z)

wanted to make sure. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:02:13.328Z)

So yeah, and it is I mean,

### You (2025-05-12T18:02:16.326Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:02:16.448Z)

yeah. And the there is just to give you I mean, because you you said your your sites are set on, know, competing with STR. There are there is a lot of additional like, the the data that STR provides is very you know, it's not very deep when it comes to the p and l. Like, they provide you know, the SDR report has, like,

### You (2025-05-12T18:02:38.796Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:02:39.128Z)

you know, occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, group, contract, trans transient group contract, and other So it's it's very it's very shallow there. But they have, obviously, a lot of properties But then the other thing they they get is they do get for a lot of hotels, they get daily data. They get it directly from the brands. So Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etcetera, produce daily level data that feeds into the SDR report. So if you look at the SDR report, it'll have, like, monthly data, and then it'll have a section of daily data. And daily data is much more difficult to get

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:17.616Z)

So I hope hope

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:18.598Z)

I don't know that we would be able to compete on that end of it.

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:18.736Z)

will get that

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:22.678Z)

But we would certainly be able to compete with the monthly level data which is and and then, obviously, having a lot more depth on the p and l So it's that's more of, like, p and l benchmarking.

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:31.146Z)

benchmarking. Yeah. Which

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:32.698Z)

Which

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:34.266Z)

SDR, it's not like

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:34.678Z)

unlike STR top line, you know,

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:37.556Z)

product. It's taken on that part. There's no

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:37.578Z)

benchmarking for occupancy ADR and RevPAR, there's no one company that has a a really dominant

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:42.446Z)

in P and L edge market.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:42.938Z)

position in p and l benchmarking. Mean, STR as a product, hot stats as a product, which just got bought by Duetto, and then DVRE as a product. But, again, there's not one like, dominates fits like the gold standard like STR. So that's an that's an easier area for us

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:50.096Z)

The

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:57.588Z)

to compete when we think about competing on benchmarking.

### You (2025-05-12T18:03:58.666Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:03:59.888Z)

And and, also, though, I think on the revenue side, which no one has done,

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:02.726Z)

Done. It one pulled

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:04.658Z)

is no one has really

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:05.676Z)

for

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:06.138Z)

pulled for for acquisition, at least. I mean, this exists when you own a property, but

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:06.166Z)

for acquisition at least. This happy, but because

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:11.018Z)

being able to pull star and then kind of overlay the Demand three sixty and then maybe pull in Cindy Estes' green,

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:11.946Z)

overlay the demand three sixty and then maybe pull syngas to this green. Her to the name of his soul is keeping me from show.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:19.448Z)

Her the name is totally escaping me. Cal Calibri Lev's. Yeah. The Calibri Labs data. They have some very impressive analytics, I think.

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:28.916Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:28.998Z)

Right. Right. And then pull in the

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:31.546Z)

Script data.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:32.018Z)

group data that is Nolan. Right?

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:34.046Z)

Right? Like, I think if we set it down, we would have up with a really good

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:35.758Z)

Like, I think if we sat down with, like, a a really good revenue

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:39.806Z)

person, we can probably

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:40.928Z)

person, we could probably put to bat together a fantastic

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:41.576Z)

put that together a fantastic tool that's revenue related using

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:45.758Z)

tool that's revenue related using five different or

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:47.276Z)

five different or six different sets of data.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:49.528Z)

six different sets of data.

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:50.956Z)

And pull it together

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:51.728Z)

And then pull it together, and then we use AI

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:53.106Z)

we use AI. To help generate

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:56.258Z)

to help generate

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:57.146Z)

assumptions

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:04:58.288Z)

assumption, you know,

### You (2025-05-12T18:04:58.376Z)

you know, assumption. I guess, for the for the model.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:00.168Z)

assumptions, I guess, for the for the model using those sources.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:01.576Z)

Using those sources. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:05.808Z)

That would be a dream. I mean, if if that could exist, like,

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:05.936Z)

I mean, if if that exist. Like, because you you

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:09.428Z)

because you you think you can I'm just gonna make something up. Right? I'm underwriting.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:09.616Z)

see you can I'm just gonna something upfront on your right. And I think I can get

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:13.858Z)

And I think I can get a 30% group mix.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:14.596Z)

a 3% group mix. So 30% of my

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:17.988Z)

So 30% of my revenue is gonna come from group. And maybe right now,

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:18.116Z)

revenue is gonna come from what we're gonna give you right now. Only 10% of the hotel's revenue is coming from

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:21.778Z)

only 10% of the hotel's revenue is coming from group.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:23.986Z)

If you can guide

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:24.858Z)

If you can dive into this Nolan data

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:25.196Z)

into this Nolan data, Nolan has

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:28.068Z)

Nolan has tells you every single group that's in a market.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:28.266Z)

tell every single group. That's in a heart. And so you can see

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:32.078Z)

And so you can see what your share of group is and where they're going

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:32.366Z)

what your share of group is and where their going. Underwriter has that tool,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:36.988Z)

It's like if if underwriters had that tool and it was really

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:38.606Z)

was really easily available. To them.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:40.488Z)

easily available to them, I think it would help them validate. Oh, well, yes.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:40.896Z)

I think you would help them validate, oh, yes. Look at all this group business.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:45.008Z)

Look at all this group business that we're missing. Right? And it's right up our alley.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:45.116Z)

That we're missing. Right. That's rare. Our alley. Yeah. Or the worst.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:48.878Z)

Or the reverse, say, oh, we're smoking weed, but there's no

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:49.026Z)

Say, oh, we're smoking weed. Nothing way over. They have a 30%.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:52.468Z)

way we're gonna get a 30% group mix. It just doesn't exist in this market. That is one example.

### You (2025-05-12T18:05:57.876Z)

Example, but these tools are are incredible.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:05:59.288Z)

But these tools are are incredible. And if they could

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:00.456Z)

And if they could come together to be, like, in a package for revenue, it would I would

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:02.938Z)

if they could come together to be, like, in a package for revenue,

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:07.086Z)

think it would be game changing for our industry. Yeah. No. That sounds great.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:07.348Z)

it would I I think it would be game changing for our industry. Yep. Alright.

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:15.766Z)

Hi.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:19.128Z)

Anything else?

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:19.186Z)

Anything else? Anything

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:23.038Z)

We wanna cover? I just have one last thing, and it's kind of still really, really early.

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:24.186Z)

I just have one last thing. It's kind of so really, really early, but

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:29.118Z)

But, my well, Drew, you'll note

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:29.406Z)

my school all about this. My friend

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:32.378Z)

all about this. My friend, Darice Rose at CBRE,

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:32.766Z)

Denise Rose at CBRE, she's an chief operating officer officer of the hotel room.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:36.568Z)

she's the chief operating officer of the hotel group. And she's very into AI. She took a AI course

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:40.196Z)

And she it to AI. She took a AI this past year.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:46.258Z)

at MIT this past year.

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:47.746Z)

And so I was just trying

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:48.938Z)

And so I was just chatting with her on Friday, catching up with her

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:49.836Z)

for on Friday. Her. And she said that

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:53.628Z)

And she said that CBRE might like to take

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:54.606Z)

I'm not going to take a second Let's look at this.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:06:57.008Z)

a second, like, a look at this even though they passed when I was there.

### You (2025-05-12T18:06:57.926Z)

Even though it has I was there. Because one,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:01.718Z)

Because, one, they, they have some potential uses where they could be a

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:02.156Z)

they they have some potential usage for the client.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:06.628Z)

client.

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:06.816Z)

Second,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:07.398Z)

And second, they have a group that's specifically looking for

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:07.546Z)

they have a group that's specifically looking for companies to invest in their

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:12.008Z)

companies to invest in that are AI driven, almost like a

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:12.626Z)

AI driven almost like a, you know, like a a seed kind of

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:15.688Z)

you know, like a a seed kind of

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:17.266Z)

investment vehicle. And then the last

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:18.768Z)

investment vehicle.

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:19.966Z)

is CBRE.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:07:20.348Z)

Then last is CBRE is a

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:21.416Z)

### You (2025-05-12T18:07:56.856Z)

That's scouting out opportunities. So I'm a lot more off to coordinate internally after that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:01.698Z)

a lot for us to coordinate internally on that, but

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:03.156Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:15.328Z)

Yeah. Are they in I mean, then when we have talked in the past, they sort of, like, aim didn't wanna do anything technology related, but then also, b, wanted to do everything in house which is obviously an inherent contradiction. Mhmm. I know. Have they gotten over that? Is that do they realize They're starting to get over that a bit and understand that they they need for the AI piece that they need to invest

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:47.066Z)

To invest externally.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:49.278Z)

externally.

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:50.016Z)

And I think

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:50.318Z)

And I think

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:51.276Z)

while the

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:52.698Z)

well, I mean, there's I mean, there's so much use case here

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:53.016Z)

there's mean, there's so much use case here on the brokerage side. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:08:56.258Z)

on the brokerage side. Right? We could just go on and on all day long.

### You (2025-05-12T18:08:56.886Z)

You can just go on and on and all day long. But it Andrew, I know this better than I

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:00.758Z)

But and, Drew, you might know this better than I do because I don't know if you've pitched her, but

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:02.446Z)

do because I don't if you pushed her, but I don't know. If Andrea has

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:05.278Z)

I don't know if Andrea has

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:06.396Z)

a good way.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:07.518Z)

a good way to digitally

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:07.866Z)

To digitally

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:10.968Z)

to digitally

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:11.276Z)

digitally

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:13.778Z)

bring in data on the asset management work she's doing. So

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:17.536Z)

think, yeah, she would because a bunch

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:18.508Z)

you would think, yes, she would because of benchmark her, but

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:19.596Z)

or but Therese mentioned that

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:21.718Z)

therese mentioned that

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:22.146Z)

there there could be some frustration there. The benchmark for you, everything

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:23.368Z)

there there could be some frustration there. The benchmarkers they do, everything is totally manual.

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:26.556Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:27.918Z)

So there are no systems

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:28.576Z)

It's just all stuff.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:30.118Z)

It's just all Excel.

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:30.206Z)

Which

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:31.468Z)

Which is insane because if they

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:32.816Z)

you know, well,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:34.138Z)

you know, well regarded product, but they do everything in Excel. So, no, there's no I've not talked to the asset management team, but I've been made very clear that everything is done in Excel. There's no systems involved. Just crazy.

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:45.946Z)

Well, I can also tell you that CBRE is the second largest RedIQ client. So their multifamily side has been using

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:09:57.218Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-12T18:09:57.516Z)

RedIQ for years. Yeah. And and and they're only second because JLL also was using it, but JLL has made it very clear over the last few years that they were trying to build their own in house and that they would eventually be leaving RedIQ. And and we got that notice back in q four. So JLL is actually pulling away this user own tool, which means CBRE will be the the largest client. So at least I know one of their groups is tool like this. So you know?

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:10:32.108Z)

And hotels will be the very last with their handout for help

### You (2025-05-12T18:10:32.666Z)

some sort of, like, teaser that something's coming soon.

### You (2025-05-12T18:11:28.376Z)

Yeah. We we can we can put something together like that. But one question I have Diane, is I know we've got the domain. But have we filed any paperwork to either incorporate or LLC or do something that would make Invest dot ai a legal entity.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:11:47.328Z)

I have not.

### You (2025-05-12T18:11:47.706Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:11:50.638Z)

I can do that. I can work on that at this next week.

### You (2025-05-12T18:11:51.516Z)

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:11:56.548Z)

What company?

### You (2025-05-12T18:11:58.856Z)

Yeah. Got it. And that's a pretty

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:03.166Z)

Got it. Yeah. Pretty straightforward. Process. Right? I've had someone walk me through it once before, and it doesn't

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:12:05.958Z)

straightforward process. Right? I've had someone walk me through it once before. I mean, it doesn't

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:09.396Z)

take that long. As long as it's deep

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:12:10.388Z)

doesn't take that long as long as it the corporate as as long as the name

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:11.656Z)

corporate as long as the name is taken. From a corporation perspective. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:12:14.338Z)

isn't taken from an incorporation perspective,

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:16.396Z)

E even some of the online even some of the online

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:12:16.858Z)

Got it.

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:19.236Z)

of tools out there, you know, for for what we've got right now with five people who are working on this that that would be sufficient. At least to, you know, to lock in the invest name. And you can copyright. Well, yeah, we we could we could work on a copyright. I was looking at a copyright for one of the products I'm working on, but even that's only $350.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:12:47.008Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-05-12T18:12:47.536Z)

Okay. To to get a copyright if you I mean, it could be less, but, if you wanna do everything on your own. But copywriting is kinda tricky. Gotta add Oh, yeah. I you do. I like

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:00.908Z)

Don't yeah. I don't think we need to that's, like,

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:01.446Z)

kinda long line of trademarking.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:02.718Z)

kinda along the lines of trademarking and

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:03.466Z)

Yeah. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:04.938Z)

and yeah, I don't know if you need

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:05.746Z)

There's any value to that.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:07.068Z)

there's any value to that.

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:07.746Z)

Right now. Probably not right now other than just the name. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:09.008Z)

Right now. Got it. And where does it matter where we incorporate? Can we incorporate is, like, I'm in Georgia, so is that good, or should we incorporate in Delaware or, like, everyone else does?

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:22.096Z)

Yeah. I don't know. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:23.598Z)

Okay. Think yeah. I mean, everyone goes to Delaware for some reason. Probably taxes. I to do it there. Their business law. Like, the laws there are different than than ever else. They're more business friendly. But I don't know that it's

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:39.426Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:40.838Z)

I guess this is

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:41.736Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:41.928Z)

probably gonna be a multi member LLC.

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:44.186Z)

Yeah. Don't know if a corporation is actually the way to go.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:45.578Z)

And

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:48.616Z)

At this point. I think

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:50.788Z)

I would say, yeah, multi member LLC. Which case, I mean, George is

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:55.066Z)

That would be

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:56.408Z)

better than most you know, you'll have

### You (2025-05-12T18:13:59.056Z)

that most.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:13:59.308Z)

I don't I think we would all end up paying taxes on our respective where we are, because the company itself is gonna pay income taxes

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:07.646Z)

Paid. Massive on you know,

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:10.228Z)

on

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:11.166Z)

pays.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:11.458Z)

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:13.506Z)

I'll hold you

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:14.878Z)

California. We paid much higher taxes than than you would if you were in in Georgia.

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:17.516Z)

and Yeah. And we have no access or not. It works

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:21.048Z)

And we have physical restrictions or whatnot. So think Georgia is probably as good as

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:22.886Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:24.128Z)

know just you know, it would

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:27.868Z)

if if it grows to the point where we need to restructure as a corporation, then you can refile

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:28.536Z)

then Yeah. You can always do that down the road. I know if you look if you're looking at a

### Guest (2025-05-12T18:14:32.328Z)

can refile somewhere else.

### You (2025-05-12T18:14:35.946Z)
