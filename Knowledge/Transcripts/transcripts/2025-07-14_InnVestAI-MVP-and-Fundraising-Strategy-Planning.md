# Transcript for: InnVestAI MVP and Fundraising Strategy Planning

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:06:14.147Z)

Is onboarded, and therefore, we really need to work with the

### You (2025-07-14T16:06:14.195Z)

Boarded, and therefore, we really need to work with the POC at this point.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:06:17.917Z)

POC at this point.

### You (2025-07-14T16:06:19.925Z)

Or am I misunderstanding that? Let me bring up his email.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:06:20.017Z)

Or am I misunderstanding that? Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:06:23.905Z)

Okay. Let me see. Alright. So So, yeah, I think what he was doing is kind of reiterating and reinforcing certain things that we had talked about regarding what's the difference between the POC and the MVP. So so, yeah, he was he was talking about the difference between the MVP and POC. That the MVP is where we can actually enable client and investor onboarding or any user. Where the p POC is our experimental portion, which is our our scooter, which is just

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:07:34.377Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-14T16:07:35.085Z)

the five of us. So so that whole section basically is just reinforcing what we've already talked about. But he did go down and and right below that, the the missing features in the POC are are items that do need to be included in the MVP. And so you know, that would be user sign up with terms and conditions Now this we can talk about we go to external users, we definitely need to have, you know, terms and conditions, some type of an agreement If we are just opening it up to friends and relatives like we've talked about and you have a high level of trust, we can probably just do a simple NDA. Or you know, it's up to you. Maybe nothing else. You know, whatever we're

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:08:32.667Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:08:35.205Z)

whatever everybody's comfortable with. I don't agree with the SSO. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:08:41.587Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:08:42.705Z)

That is something that we would definitely need in version one. But let me talk to the node in and see what he's thinking because we did have a conversation. I know Drew also mentioned regarding SSO that he's using Microsoft Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:09:04.127Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:09:05.615Z)

So so maybe, you know, I I just need to find out what type of SSO he has in mind. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:09:14.787Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:09:15.785Z)

Because I don't believe that it is a requirement for the MVP. It is absolutely, like, where I'm for version one. When we start going out to anybody in the industry who wants to to sign up. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:09:28.317Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:09:30.295Z)

New deal date creation and document uploads, those are partially in the POC right now. So that's not a problem. Document processing, we have a call today at five with Vinod, Drew, and I to talk about the routing of the document. So if we can get assurance from Drew that he wants to process all the documents through his existing system, then we don't have to build our own.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:09:58.407Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:09:59.425Z)

Okay. So so we're we're gonna talk about that. I've I've kinda set up a work flow. But we are at the point where we're gonna need a commitment. One way or the other. Either Sure. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:12.737Z)

Drew. Right?

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:14.585Z)

Either he Yeah. Either he does. And from all

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:15.447Z)

Yeah. K.

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:17.905Z)

signs, it sounds to me like he's committed. So, I don't see that as being an issue know, because he's brought up in a previous call that we had last week about the all of the historical documents going through HBIS and and going through. So I I think that's okay.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:36.517Z)

I have raised it now twice

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:38.095Z)

Date of birth now twice with him over the past, like,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:41.247Z)

with him over the past, like, week and a half when it felt like

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:42.275Z)

week and a half. It felt like a moment was right.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:45.167Z)

a moment was right. And so he definitely wants

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:45.965Z)

So he definitely wants a 20% share and

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:49.297Z)

a 20% share in

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:51.145Z)

in that day. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:52.247Z)

InnVestAI. So that then aligns us. Right?

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:52.815Z)

that aligns us. Right? Because he is an investor in InvestAI, not just

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:55.807Z)

He is an investor in InvestAI, not just

### You (2025-07-14T16:10:58.435Z)

we're not just a client of his. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:10:58.827Z)

we're not just a client of his.

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:00.825Z)

And then he I I did mention to him

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:01.847Z)

And then he's I I did mention to him

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:03.955Z)

we could look at some sort of

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:04.867Z)

we could look at some sort of buyout of

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:06.055Z)

buyout of hotel biz, there's not tons of revenue.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:09.297Z)

hotel biz, all although, right, there's not tons of revenue

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:12.205Z)

But it's something we could look at. He did

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:13.277Z)

but it's something we could look at. He didn't we didn't really discuss that, but he I know he's

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:14.805Z)

really just that, but he I know he's thinking about how

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:18.217Z)

thinking about how we could structure the two companies.

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:18.765Z)

could structure the two companies. I'm thinking about how two companies become one company.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:21.897Z)

And I'm thinking about how two companies become one company.

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:25.025Z)

But yes, started the conversation about it.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:26.147Z)

We have started the conversation about it. And the fact that he wants

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:28.055Z)

And the fact that he wants to be a partner in an InvestAI gives me a lot of comfort that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:30.697Z)

to be a partner in InnVestAI gives me a lot of comfort that we can work through it with him.

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:33.025Z)

we can work through it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No. That that's great news. And then the last two, the data persistence, that's that's basic database one zero one. So the the POC right now is technically, it's it's not even connected to a database. It's just a

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:11:49.937Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:11:51.185Z)

self contained place where you can go and type in information, but whatever you type in is not saved. That's easy. And same thing with user and account management. That's something we touched on last week as how how how are we going to structure the account management because the the simple way is somebody signs a contract with InnVest to use our tool. They would have an account. And then within the account, you'll have users. It could just be one, one person shot. So, you know, it could be, you know, the the Diane investment company and Diane, the user. Or it could be like CBRE where each account would probably be at the office level. Which is like they did at Procadia. So each individual office

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:12:41.417Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:12:45.845Z)

could could create an account in in BestAI. And that's fine. Each one would have their account, and then the users in that office, however it Berends, there were people who actually worked with multiple offices.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:13:00.497Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:13:01.315Z)

With with that. And so you know, Diane might be in the Atlanta office, but Diane might also help the Dallas office. And Thank you. Depending on on that. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:13:11.927Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:13:14.395Z)

that means a user might be actually technically part of two accounts, and and that gets a little tricky. So we just need to figure out how we how we wanna do that. That portion does not have to be up for the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:13:30.227Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:13:30.625Z)

Okay. And maybe not even version one. Right? I I think I don't wanna wait until the situation arises, but it's not a blocker.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:13:41.267Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:13:41.395Z)

To to Okay. K. So the here's this next one with with the real question, you know, With with the exception of the SSO, I I think that that would be what we need to do to get people using the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:13:57.137Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:13:57.925Z)

Okay. Which is you know, he he included angel investors, you know, but but like in our conversation last week, we might be able to get some angel investors just with a demo of the POC. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:11.257Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:11.285Z)

I don't know how many angel investors are actually gonna want to get in And I did if they're not if they're not hospitality underwriters,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:19.657Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:19.775Z)

not gonna know what this model is. Right? So so that part, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:21.987Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:23.585Z)

can take that with a grain of salt. Document management, if you saw my email over the weekend, I was asking for input from yourself and Drew.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:33.777Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:33.905Z)

And Mark as well. We will have a fully functional document management system, but probably not with all the bells and whistles that Drew was asking for. But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:44.037Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:46.885Z)

but, yes, that that will be up there as well.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:14:47.157Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:14:49.685Z)

Okay. Alright. So for the AI features, this is something that I think might have been a a typo because he put in four MVP or phase two. He he might be thinking that MVP is version one. I don't know. That's I'm not gonna worry about that. So it's probably semantics. But I also sent out that information with the links to the the the resources for what constitutes, you know, the MVP and all of that information. Again, I I I just kinda wanna make sure that we are all on the same page as to what AI means. Right. And so, you know, there's And I feel like

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:15:41.377Z)

Right. And I feel like we might not all be because

### You (2025-07-14T16:15:43.935Z)

might not all be because because somehow we have to draw, like,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:15:48.647Z)

because somehow we have to draw, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:15:51.255Z)

okay.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:15:52.087Z)

okay. And I have I have a bunch of updates

### You (2025-07-14T16:15:52.215Z)

I have I a bunch of updates to, like, people I talked to last week. I wanna

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:15:55.317Z)

to, like, people I talked to last week that I wanna share with you, but let me

### You (2025-07-14T16:15:56.195Z)

share with you, but all of these stick stick on this for a second.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:15:58.927Z)

stick on this for a second.

### You (2025-07-14T16:15:59.685Z)

It is I'm

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:00.877Z)

Is

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:02.105Z)

ready to go start to

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:02.107Z)

I I'm ready to go start to

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:03.515Z)

talk to angel investors with the POC. I'm fine with it. I I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:04.707Z)

talk to angel investors with the POC. I'm fine with it. I I

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:07.825Z)

now especially after we did two demos last week, but

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:09.077Z)

now, especially after we did two demos last week,

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:12.165Z)

just a little bit

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:12.727Z)

I think with just a little bit more fine tuning, we really have a good

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:12.905Z)

more fine tuning. You really have a good POC to show.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:16.857Z)

POC to show, and we could attempt

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:17.475Z)

And could attempt to try to raise

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:20.897Z)

to try to raise

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:21.555Z)

angel investors or angel investors.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:22.797Z)

angel investors or angel invest right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:24.275Z)

Yeah. I don't feel like

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:25.577Z)

I don't feel like Mark feels that way yet, though.

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:26.615Z)

Mark feels that way yet, though. No. No. And something he said

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:29.737Z)

And something he said

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:30.055Z)

last week is he's part of an internal investor group, and he

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:31.317Z)

last week is he's part of an angel investor group, and he told me he would not take this product to his angel investor group unless it had x, y, and z. And that's where I feel like we're

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:34.675Z)

told me he would not this product. To his usual investor group unless it had y and z. And that's why I feel like we're we're we're not all aligned on, like Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:43.587Z)

we're we're not all aligned on, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:45.375Z)

Well, what is

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:46.487Z)

well, what is that? And is that an MVP? Because if it's an MVP,

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:46.505Z)

that? And is that an MVP? Because if it's an MVP, then the MVP is actually what we're gonna

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:51.807Z)

then the MVP is actually what we're gonna use to

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:52.765Z)

to. To onboard clients. Right? And and so

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:54.547Z)

to onboard clients. Right? And and so

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:56.485Z)

I don't I don't know if I close the gap on that.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:16:57.747Z)

I don't I don't know how to close the gap on that.

### You (2025-07-14T16:16:59.975Z)

You know, we we talked about that last week. You you brought that up and and

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:17:01.377Z)

But

### You (2025-07-14T16:17:04.255Z)

that's what I mentioned that his angel investor group does not represent all angel investors.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:17:09.197Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:17:10.835Z)

And so every angel investor has different goals. And and that's what kinda spurred me on to to send some of the information that I sent out. And one of the things that was included in that link, I don't know whether he's seen it or not, does talk about the hype cycle. And and where we are and if you're not involved in the tech industry, you may not be familiar what they mean by the hype cycle, but it's it it's basically what it sounds like. And it talks about whenever there's a new technology, or something that comes out, there's always this slow adoption of it. And, you know, you you've got your early adopters, the the people who wanna be the first onboard to try something. And then it gets more traction, more traction, then all of sudden, it spikes up because everybody wants to use it. And then it drops. Like a rock because people realize that this is cool, but, you know, that goes on there. And and we are actually beyond that peak with AI. Right? Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:18:23.937Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:18:25.365Z)

I came across another article in my feed for my medium that basically talks about that as well. Kinda reinforcing the other information that I had. So I think Mark is still in that peak. He's still in that hype cycle.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:18:45.527Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:18:47.085Z)

That he thinks everybody's gonna have AI. But now there are actually companies that are avoiding AI. And having AI in our name may or may not be beneficial. Mhmm. And and the article, again, just reinforces that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:19:06.877Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:19:11.225Z)

people are getting to the point now where everybody's tried g g g p t. Everybody's tried a little bit of this and that.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:19:20.077Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:19:22.415Z)

A lot of them have bad experiences with the results that come back. And and and it's just saying, again, the the AI should be invisible. To the user and should be in the background.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:19:35.207Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:19:37.385Z)

But I do believe Mark thinks it's gotta have all this AI up there. And another thing that occurred to me over the weekend is BERCADIA will not use

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:19:47.257Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:19:47.805Z)

external AI. And so you know, it would be great to get the Berecadia team on board But we may want to consider our AI features to be add ons.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:20:03.967Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:20:04.085Z)

In the future. Now I would exclude the document processing and the things that we are actually going to be using AI

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:20:11.277Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:20:13.015Z)

out of the But, again, those are out out there. What's gonna make this tool stick? Is

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:20:23.797Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:20:24.395Z)

the speed. Making sure that it can be done way faster than in Excel more accurate, and dependable that you get reliable answers. And to do that, we can use AI under the covers, not on the user,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:20:40.377Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:20:43.825Z)

to do a lot of those things. They don't have to go into a chat box and say, write up a summary. You know? We can

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:20:49.057Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:20:49.955Z)

all of that can be automated. So that's where I think we need to I think that that I don't I don't know how we can convince Mark But he's made

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:08.017Z)

Well, I think, mean, maybe it's like how you described it. There's a road map

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:08.525Z)

it's like how you described it. There's a road

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:12.837Z)

Right? Like, shows this is where we are, and then this is we're just steps away from this.

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:14.935Z)

steps away from this. Yeah. Going back

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:17.807Z)

I was going back through Vinod's budget. So we've kind of locked our

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:17.815Z)

to her. Budget. So we kinda locked our our minds around 10 k.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:22.977Z)

our minds around 10 k but 10 k is actually an annual number he gave.

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:24.345Z)

But 10 k is actually an annual number he gave. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:30.647Z)

So like, I like, if Mark and like, I'm totally tapped since especially since my consulting project ended,

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:32.095Z)

like, get more picture on the iPad. Totally kept since especially since my ended. But if I go back in and I scale that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:39.867Z)

But if I go back in and I scale back

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:41.715Z)

because it was

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:43.107Z)

because the nodes

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:44.205Z)

the six k was

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:44.517Z)

the 6 k was an annual estimate. And if I go back and

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:45.525Z)

annual estimate. And I go back in and a month, go back to the monthly estimate. And then Drew had

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:49.127Z)

and create a month, go back to the monthly estimate, and then Drew has

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:52.835Z)

four d, web hosting four months that he said it at the notes number, and that was,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:53.937Z)

for the web hosting four months that he said at Vinod's number, and that was, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:21:57.475Z)

like, three k. Yep. So I don't think it's quite 10 k to guess what the new said

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:21:58.907Z)

3 k. So I don't think it's quite 10 k to get us what Vinod said he needs.

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:03.765Z)

he needs. To get to the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:06.407Z)

To get to the MVP.

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:07.145Z)

So that's one thing. And then second thing, maybe it's like as you and I discussed

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:08.497Z)

So that's one thing. And then second thing, maybe it's, like, as you and I have discussed,

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:11.965Z)

there's a proof of concept and then there's like the dot dot dot, like, coming attraction, comes like this is

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:13.467Z)

the proof of concept, and then there's, like, the dot dot dot, like, coming attraction, come

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:16.725Z)

what we're gonna need to do. I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:17.687Z)

this is what we're gonna use AI for so that the

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:18.215Z)

that the the group can actually see

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:21.077Z)

his angel investor group can actually see the lineage

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:22.995Z)

lineage of it. That makes sense. But just no

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:24.787Z)

of it, if if that makes sense, but just not actually see it in use.

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:26.015Z)

see it. Use. And I personally believe

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:28.857Z)

And I personally believe if there's another company out there that's already doing it,

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:29.215Z)

that there's another company out there that's already doing it. We can point to that company and say, look, it's fee it's completely feasible

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:33.467Z)

we can point to that company and say, look, it's fee it's completely feasible because deal path

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:36.065Z)

because DealPath is doing it or this

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:38.437Z)

is doing it or this, you know, multifamily AVM is doing it.

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:39.115Z)

you know, multifamily is doing it. So we can do it. There's a

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:43.407Z)

So we could do it. There's no reason we can't figure this out. It's just we're not

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:44.525Z)

can't figure this out is just we're not quite there yet in the

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:47.807Z)

quite there yet in the in the product development.

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:48.015Z)

the product development. Yeah. Am I what do you think about that?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:22:51.237Z)

Am I what do you think about that?

### You (2025-07-14T16:22:52.445Z)

I I agree. I mean, that's that that's that's what we need to do is to get to to just to get the money to get us up and running. Because like we talked about last week, we are at the point where we have to have a company credit card, basically Right. To get this

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:23:11.097Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:23:13.175Z)

inform or to get the subscription to the database. And all of this other stuff that we need. So, you know, in order to do that, we have to have a company bank account. In order to have the company bank account, we have to be we have to have our LLP. We have to do all this other stuff or the LLC.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:23:31.837Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:23:34.285Z)

So so, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that need to be done, but they need to be done quickly. And think that's where our focus should be right now. Because it's a roadblock. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:23:49.167Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:23:49.255Z)

There was no LP agreement

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:23:51.017Z)

There was an LLP agreement in what

### You (2025-07-14T16:23:51.725Z)

in audit. The the corporation that I used to incorporate. They gave, like,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:23:54.657Z)

the the corporation in Delaware that I used to incorporate, they gave, like, example

### You (2025-07-14T16:23:57.725Z)

example of all the agreements. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:00.247Z)

of all the agreements. So I should probably get that

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:01.475Z)

I should probably get that And, of course, they did do it digitally. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:04.767Z)

Of course, they didn't give it to me digitally. Right? They to be honest.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:07.145Z)

Old school finder, but I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:08.567Z)

Old school binder, but I should get that scanned and

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:09.315Z)

get that scanned and circulated to everyone.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:12.697Z)

to everyone.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:13.095Z)

And then if anyone has a different

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:14.457Z)

Then if anyone has a different

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:14.845Z)

LLP that they wanna use, we can talk about it.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:16.267Z)

LLP that they wanna use, we can talk about it.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:19.375Z)

So that and then

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:20.907Z)

So that and then I just so you know, that same company is

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:21.885Z)

I just so you know, that same company is applying for our EIN number, and they had to fax

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:25.637Z)

applying for our EIN number, and they had to fax it to the IRS.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:27.395Z)

it to the IRS. So I'm in full

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:30.427Z)

So I'm in holding mode waiting for that.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:31.085Z)

for that one. They weren't sure if there was

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:33.447Z)

They weren't sure if there was an another InnVestAI that that had an EIN.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:33.735Z)

another InnVestAI that that had the INN. I don't think there is because the way we spelled it, but I'm guessing that's what what held it up.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:39.737Z)

There is because of the way we spelled it, but I'm guessing that's what held it up.

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:42.855Z)

Is that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:44.167Z)

Is that

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:45.365Z)

and then

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:46.987Z)

and then, I guess, can I'm gonna just

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:46.995Z)

guess I'm gonna just flip over to some things. I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:50.077Z)

flip over to some things I did last week so that you kinda have a sense of

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:50.755Z)

last week so that I can have a sense of who I've been chatting with and what.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:55.047Z)

who I've been chatting with and what that's leading to. Because

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:55.505Z)

That's leading to because I have my fingers crossed it's gonna

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:24:58.847Z)

### You (2025-07-14T16:24:59.315Z)

It's it's a strong network in the hospitality industry. And

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:25:29.447Z)

### You (2025-07-14T16:27:42.035Z)

here between us and find click. To get from Anna's husband is an angel on VC investors, they're they could lead

### You (2025-07-14T16:27:54.615Z)

not at this moment,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:27:56.357Z)

but let's say, a year from now, if we were to if we were to enter into a strategic partnership with them,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:28:00.747Z)

if we were to enter into a strategic partnership with them,

going into the hotel renovation space. So we can pull up that information.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:28:17.687Z)

that information. It's why I talk about Procore so much.

### You (2025-07-14T16:28:18.585Z)

ProQuest so much. Mhmm. But this could be such an important

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:28:21.367Z)

But this could be such an important relationship for us

### You (2025-07-14T16:28:23.805Z)

because it could help us to

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:28:25.467Z)

because it could help us to accelerate how we collect

### You (2025-07-14T16:28:27.505Z)

To know deeper if they have

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:30:20.247Z)

how do the analysts start to go deeper if they have more time?

point to her was

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:30:24.317Z)

20% leveraged IRR. It all comes down to your revenue and your revenue

### You (2025-07-14T16:30:33.155Z)

revenue and your revenue strategy. And that is very hard

the, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:39:57.655Z)

he start collectively parsing out the industry how to attack it. That makes sense. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:04.037Z)

he and I can start collectively parsing out the industry and figuring out

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:05.425Z)

I to figure out how to get markup to to opt up to the same

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:08.827Z)

how to attack it, if that makes sense. Right? So

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:09.935Z)

point. Or

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:11.907Z)

I have to figure out how to get markup just up to the same point. Or I fear we will be delayed another four to six months in a limbo process where we don't

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:12.445Z)

year, we will be doing another four to six months. In a little process where we get to the point where maybe we're actually closing some sort of preseason, right, earlier to come October, November,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:24.567Z)

get to the point where maybe we're actually closing some sort of

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:25.245Z)

December versus starting to talk to folks. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:28.757Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:33.307Z)

to folks.

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:33.445Z)

full on. I've never done this before, so I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:34.217Z)

And I could be wrong in this, Howard. Like, I I'm

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:36.295Z)

I don't know what doing. And what it does. But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:39.187Z)

you know, out. I've never done this before, so I don't

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:41.395Z)

but

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:42.747Z)

I don't know what I'm doing. And Mark does,

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:43.205Z)

I don't know. I feel like we have and we'll if we don't.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:46.647Z)

But

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:47.335Z)

Start to talk to the casters.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:47.847Z)

but

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:49.295Z)

Very

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:49.537Z)

wanna I feel like we have momentum, and we'll lose momentum if we don't

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:49.755Z)

soon. Yeah. That that is that's that is my concern.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:40:53.777Z)

start to talk to investors very, very soon.

### You (2025-07-14T16:40:55.115Z)

I I can't afford delays. I mean, I'm gonna be flat out honest. Right? And you're you're in the same situation. You know, we we need to get this going as fast as I can, and that's why

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:41:06.697Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-14T16:41:07.995Z)

you know, when I when I hear the comments about, well, we can't do anything if we don't have all this AI baked into it. And I I, you know, I don't wanna start clashing or having any stay in your lane conversations. Which, you know, I I I get it. I understand. But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:41:33.737Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:41:33.925Z)

yeah, I just I don't know how to I mean, I'm I'm just gonna keep being the squeaky wheel and you know? Pushing pushing back. But, you know, if he

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:41:44.337Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:41:44.825Z)

digs his heels and says, I'm not gonna talk to anybody until we have this particular AI feature, then that's going to be a problem. Right. So So like,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:00.287Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:00.605Z)

like, almost you know, she

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:02.647Z)

So we just have to figure out how to, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:06.295Z)

in. File.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:07.177Z)

like, almost

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:07.575Z)

And keep it working.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:08.967Z)

he he wants to wrap his head around how much it's gonna cost to get this in cloud.

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:09.295Z)

Right. Right? And so to me, there's the cost of it it in the cloud.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:13.787Z)

And keep the node working. Right? And so

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:14.415Z)

The notes cost as well. Yeah. Right? Like, if

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:17.567Z)

to me, there's the cost of getting it in the cloud, but there's

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:17.825Z)

take the notes comfortable enough that he could quit his contract

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:20.907Z)

the nodes cost as well. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:22.155Z)

job. But we

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:23.777Z)

it would take the node feeling comfortable enough that he could

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:23.955Z)

have it. Anything together yet. No. Give him like,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:26.857Z)

quit his contract job, but we don't have anything together yet.

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:26.945Z)

deep to do that. Program.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:31.677Z)

That would give him, like, the ability to do that. Or it would be a junior programmer coming on board under him, right, to help

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:34.225Z)

Get us to a certain point. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And, yeah, we need to have

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:40.647Z)

get us to a certain point.

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:43.275Z)

a a road map

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:42:43.587Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:42:45.895Z)

and that is something that is technically falls into my InnVenodes wheelhouse responsibilities. But I don't want anybody to think that we're doing it in a vacuum either. Right. So all of the things that were put together when when you and Drew Mark met and you have your

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:43:07.267Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:43:10.475Z)

items here, that's all very helpful. But I need to work with Vinod on the order of things because there's dependencies. There are things that you Right. Do until this particular thing is complete. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:43:26.687Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:43:28.945Z)

that's that's where we need to get in.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:43:31.197Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:43:32.555Z)

And and that's the thing that's bothering me now is estimating how much time it's going to take because I don't know what to know. It's availability is. Right. And whether or not we can I mean, if

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:43:45.387Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:43:45.845Z)

you know, it it's it's kind of a a a circular thing here? It's like, well can't really put together a road map unless we know how many people we can

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:43:54.857Z)

It is.

### You (2025-07-14T16:43:55.065Z)

count on to be coding and we can't count on coding unless we have some type of an idea of a budget. So it's Right. It's like we we need to start somewhere. And and get it going there. So, yeah, it's it's it's

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:44:08.757Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:44:10.675Z)

it's it's tricky. I I understand. You know? It's a don't envy any position at all right now. We're kinda leading all of this and and trying to keep everybody

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:44:22.587Z)

I am

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:01.335Z)

Plus some of the for break

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:04.587Z)

taking into account what the node put together,

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:04.645Z)

cost and travel. Conferences and stuff like that. So that part

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:08.067Z)

plus some of the incorporation costs,

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:09.565Z)

can get us had around what that number

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:11.627Z)

and the travel and conferences and stuff like that so that Mark can get head around what that number is. And then

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:16.945Z)

the POC, and the dot dot dot

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:19.647Z)

you and I together need to put together, like, the k. Here's the POC.

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:19.905Z)

coming in. Attraction. It just might not be ready. Before. We can take it out too.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:24.627Z)

And here's the dot dot dot coming attraction. It just might not

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:25.975Z)

Proceed. Angel. Investors. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:28.157Z)

be ready before we can take it out to

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:30.945Z)

Yeah. No. I mean, that that's exactly what we need to do. But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:32.467Z)

precede Angel Investors.

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:33.965Z)

I don't it it sounds to me like you've got some potential angel investors. I that are at least some context that you can approach the subject with. Are you are you planning to do that without Mark being on the call? Or

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:46.027Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:47.355Z)

I'm not planning to them. I'm only at like, like, it's an intro. Right? So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:54.187Z)

I'm not planning to actually broach them. I'm only doing it, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:54.835Z)

Okay. Carol as good friends with Jessica. So because they're

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:45:58.857Z)

like, as an intro. Right? So Carol is a good friends with

### You (2025-07-14T16:45:58.895Z)

friends, it was makes sense, Carol and I are friends. Could have the first pass of a conversation with Jessica. But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:03.677Z)

Jessica. So because they're friends, if this makes sense,

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:06.545Z)

I would know, like, actually,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:07.117Z)

Carol and I are friends, I'm gonna have the first pass

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:08.185Z)

go front of her as a company. You're right. I'm so wrong.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:10.437Z)

of a conversation with Jessica, but I would not actually

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:11.405Z)

A lot. For for to request for

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:14.857Z)

go in front of her as a company, right, until we're all aligned on this.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:15.505Z)

funding and get my pitch deck and all that. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:19.257Z)

For

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:19.705Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:20.057Z)

for

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:20.075Z)

I'm talking to

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:21.077Z)

to request for funding and give our pitch deck and all of that.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:21.525Z)

therapist. Person there. To get me some advice, but

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:24.427Z)

Same with FARE. Right? I'm talking to

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:25.585Z)

it we would not approach there

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:27.927Z)

a very junior person there to give me some advice.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:27.965Z)

formally. That. Until we're all aligned. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:31.697Z)

But it we would not approach there formally until we're all aligned.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:36.555Z)

I'm probably

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:38.347Z)

On the on the mind

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:40.165Z)

I'll probably take an intro call with Joanna.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:42.287Z)

click thing, I'm probably because

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:43.305Z)

Because it's in kind of, like, in

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:44.897Z)

because Andrea and I are such good friends, I'll probably take the intro call with Joanna.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:44.945Z)

my friends and family that we're actually

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:49.687Z)

Just because it's in kind of, like, in my friends and family network.

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:50.545Z)

or press presentation until we're all on board.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:53.487Z)

Same thing, we wouldn't actually do any kind of formal request or presentation

### You (2025-07-14T16:46:54.335Z)

So what else

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:46:58.457Z)

until we're all on board.

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:00.305Z)

can I do to help solve this problem?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:02.597Z)

So

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:02.695Z)

To your hand now? If you were

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:04.407Z)

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:14.455Z)

really in a position for more.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:15.837Z)

any other ideas like, platforms you can point to? Or

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:19.485Z)

Test it. Like, we originally hoped until we

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:20.847Z)

because we're really not gonna be in a position where Mark can hand this over to analysts and have them test it, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:22.905Z)

get to the MVP. Right? Right. Right. The MVP is when we have

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:27.807Z)

we originally hoped until we get to the MVP.

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:29.145Z)

the the friends and family, the the analysts testing.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:31.297Z)

Right?

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:33.125Z)

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:39.617Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:41.095Z)

Right? So, yes, the MVP is the first testers out

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:45.467Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:47:50.135Z)

of the five of us. So should to press more on

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:47:59.077Z)

Maybe we should

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:00.965Z)

proficient analyst.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:03.747Z)

try to

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:03.785Z)

And said why don't we just do it? Demo?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:06.327Z)

press Mark on his

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:06.695Z)

With your practice on the analyst? Correct?

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:08.477Z)

Prakashani analyst and say, why don't we just

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:08.845Z)

Yeah. People that will be able to take over the screen

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:13.057Z)

demo?

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:13.595Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:14.137Z)

With your Prakashani analyst? Right? He won't that analyst won't be able to take over this

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:14.685Z)

like, I'm I'm even think I would to be on that. Like, she just like we've done it with

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:19.107Z)

screen, and

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:20.855Z)

Like, you and

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:22.027Z)

like, I don't I don't even think I would need to be on that. Like, she

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:22.225Z)

Mark to do that with his production analysis. And just fish.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:25.167Z)

just like we've done it with Nir and with Cara, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:25.745Z)

For feedback. Yeah. Right? Yeah. That's That would be very

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:28.727Z)

you and Mark could do that with his Prakashani analyst and just fish

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:29.855Z)

Yeah. And we just try to let Mark know that.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:32.967Z)

for feedback. Right? Like, what would you like?

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:33.075Z)

Well. Did hope she could just this over. It's just not gonna be

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:36.117Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:36.565Z)

feasible given the timing. Yeah. But at the

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:37.357Z)

And we just try to let Mark know that while we had hoped you could just

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:39.265Z)

POC is far enough with that. Really

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:41.847Z)

hand this over, it's not gonna be feasible given the timing.

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:42.275Z)

think getting. Analyst to look at this in a

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:45.707Z)

But that the POC is far enough along that we really think getting

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:45.965Z)

friend's family. Network. Just just and we don't want to them. Person's

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:50.667Z)

an analyst to look at this that's in a friends and family network

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:50.845Z)

them. The control to try to test it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:54.607Z)

just just as we demo it to them versus

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:56.075Z)

Alright. So tomorrow,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:48:57.657Z)

giving them the control to try to test it.

### You (2025-07-14T16:48:58.675Z)

and our call at 05:00 is when I was going to start going through that list. Of items on the road map so that we can start ranking and scoring and planning. Okay. In addition to that, I will go through

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:49:16.317Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-14T16:49:16.725Z)

all of the documents that we have in terms of you know, the road map and timing and put a very high level about, you know, this especially, I I think did a good job of, you know, this is what we need. To get to the MVP. And I don't even know if I'd put dates on it. I might just do a Gantt chart without dates that kinda visualize the process and what needs to be done in dependencies. And then once we have an idea of how much funding can we get today. To to get the node that helped he needs and and the tools that he needs in order to get an MVP. And then we can start working on the the gap between the MVP and version one. When can we have outside people that could be from anybody start to use the tool.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:18.797Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:19.935Z)

Like, the the business side of the budget. I'm gonna pay for with you.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:24.067Z)

And then I'll be prepared to follow you with

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:24.345Z)

And prepare and then I have it

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:27.017Z)

like, the the

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:28.355Z)

to

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:28.707Z)

business side of the budget. I'm gonna take what Vinod has prepared and then add in

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:28.755Z)

look the I've got an that we can come up with

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:33.437Z)

things that I'm thinking we need to get us

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:34.285Z)

a six month number in that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:35.647Z)

to roughly January is in my head. And then

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:36.685Z)

one. Monthly number for her to wrap this head around. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:39.457Z)

so that we can come up with a

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:40.225Z)

I added that extra worksheet

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:41.537Z)

a six month number and then a monthly number for Mark to wrap his head around.

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:43.285Z)

one that Vinod and I were working on just for some of our tools and subscriptions. Let me go through that. And indicate which ones we would need

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:50:52.237Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-14T16:50:52.405Z)

ASAP versus the ones that can wait even that, I mean, that was even if we did everything on that worksheet, it was only, like, $3,000 a year, I think, off the top. Right. Right. But yeah. Yeah. So just so we can account for that. Right. Year. Right? So we're really just talking about how do we

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:14.387Z)

Right. Right. Where it wasn't much. Yes.

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:16.605Z)

get from now.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:16.927Z)

Yeah. No. I

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:17.535Z)

Into the chain. Very

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:18.527Z)

and that's a year. Right?

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:18.855Z)

survival? Price. Get the MVP done

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:21.697Z)

We're really just talking about how do we get from now until January survival, right, so that we can get the MVP belt,

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:22.385Z)

and we can get more pills so we can start to go raise seed funding Yeah. Then will allow us to start funding

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:29.807Z)

and we can get more comfortable so we can start to go raise the pre seed funding

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:31.365Z)

something for ourselves and the technology piece of it

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:34.537Z)

which that then will allow us to start funding

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:35.435Z)

And then I there's something else I was thinking about in my head is, you know, we're in the

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:38.907Z)

something for ourselves and the technology piece of it.

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:41.515Z)

these companies. That I

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:43.247Z)

I I have something else I just have been thinking about in my head is

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:43.295Z)

not very well with data. And Trimplot.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:47.517Z)

where I'm approaching these companies that I know very, very well, like,

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:48.525Z)

I was gonna about this a little little bit more, but there is

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:51.677Z)

Davidson and Driftwood,

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:53.505Z)

there that

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:54.587Z)

I I I just need to think about this a little bit more, but

### You (2025-07-14T16:51:54.635Z)

it lieu of an investment in us, they could fire the nose,

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:51:58.417Z)

there is some possibility out there that

### You (2025-07-14T16:52:00.605Z)

And contribute his time

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:52:01.827Z)

in lieu of an investment in us,

### You (2025-07-14T16:52:02.755Z)

as an investment. Because they're actually

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:52:05.057Z)

they could hire Vinod and contribute his

### You (2025-07-14T16:52:05.625Z)

formed companies that could take him on and his and his employer.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:52:09.337Z)

time an investment because they're actually formed companies that could take him on and his employ and his employment on, if this makes

### You (2025-07-14T16:52:14.275Z)

$250,000 a year, right, it is making this, you know, grossed out for benefits.

### Guest (2025-07-14T16:52:18.537Z)

sense. And then if that is

### You (2025-07-14T16:52:18.875Z)

Benefits as more for
