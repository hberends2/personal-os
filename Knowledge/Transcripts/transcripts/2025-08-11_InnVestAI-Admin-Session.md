# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:00:23.023Z)

I wasn't available last Thursday and Friday.

### You (2025-08-11T14:00:23.104Z)

I wasn't available on Thursday and Friday. Oh, no worries. I hope everything's okay. Sounded like he had some family issues. Going on there?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:00:31.983Z)

Yeah, I did.

### You (2025-08-11T14:00:31.984Z)

Yeah. It's taken care of to the best of my abilities.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:00:33.583Z)

It's taken care out of the best of my abilities.

### You (2025-08-11T14:00:37.824Z)

How are you?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:00:37.903Z)

How are you? How was the last week?

### You (2025-08-11T14:00:38.624Z)

How was the last week? Last week was good. Very productive. One of the things I wanted to discuss is setting up some time this week. For a couple of different things here. If I can pull it up here, my own notes. So there are a couple things that I've got in the works that are kind of. Pretty important. I think that we need to get together with the appropriate people. I don't think this is something where we need to get all five of us. I think we need to get specific people involved. With this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:01:21.423Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:01:24.624Z)

One of them that I sent out to Vinod and Drew is getting the technical requirements for our account and user creation. We need to have that in place before we can do the mvp. Not a major hurdle at all. I just want to make sure. The only thing that we wanted to account for is what we encountered at Berkadia If we do get any institutional users and sometimes. An analyst or somebody at that level might be shared between different offices. And I don't know how all. How all brokerages do it. But I suspect most of them are the same as Berkadia or each office independent. And can make their own decisions as to what tools they use. So there were not many, but there were a few offices that shared. An analyst. And so we need to incorporate. A little bit of a. I mean, the only thing that's going to be a little bit tricky is to have a user associated to do two different accounts. So each office would have their own account, right? It wouldn't be burkindia. It would be Berkadia at Leon Brocadia, Dallas Brocadia, whatever. For the accounts. So that is the only thing that I've got Vinod and Drew looking at. But then last week, I also circulated the service agreement. In terms of service, I would really like to get. I saw that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:03:18.863Z)

I saw that. So, I mean, is there that it looked like Drew's agreement was way better?

### You (2025-08-11T14:03:21.504Z)

Peer disagreement was, like, way better. Right. Drew's agreement was way better than our initial. But they were still missing things in Drew's agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:03:31.743Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:03:33.584Z)

So what I did is I did a really. I used Gemini Deep learning, which I am absolutely amazed at how detailed that thing can get. It generated a 27 page. Outline of each service agreement. And the gaps. But we need to make a decision on that. Because same thing. We can't really get anybody using the platform. Without an agreement. There were a couple things missing. On both. But the most important was the AI disclaimer. Neither model had that. So we do need to. And I think that's something that just you and Drew and I need to discuss. I don't think it really falls into Mark or Vinod's area, but we can certainly add them as optional if they want to join.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:04:29.343Z)

Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:04:33.104Z)

But I'll take the lead in that. And then the last thing is the formulas document that I sent out. I'm very confident in the accuracy of the formulas. I'm not confident in that. I didn't overlook a formula. I'm not talking just the av. Just the mvp. Or version one. I'm thinking future. Is there any formula we may need? Because, honestly, the engineers can't really start doing anything. Without having those formulas. And I want to make. Can I ask a question as an example?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:19.103Z)

So can I ask a question as an example?

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:22.384Z)

One thing that we didn't put in POC or B mvp, something called flow and flex. And so basically, it's a percentage of what amounts the revenue comes to the JL penal line. If your brain or your occupancy is off or above, right?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:23.023Z)

One thing that we didn't put in the POC or the MVP is something called flow and flex. And so basically, it's a percentage of what amount the revenue comes to the GOP line. If your rate or your occupancy is off or above, right?

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:44.464Z)

And it's something we use in the hospitality industry.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:45.263Z)

And it's something we use in the hospitality industry.

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:46.864Z)

All the time.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:47.583Z)

All the time.

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:48.704Z)

We include it in the POC or the mvp if you're trying to keep it very simple.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:49.103Z)

We didn't include it. In the POC or the mvp because we were trying to keep it very simple. But that would be. There's a clear formula.

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:56.144Z)

Clear form is that you're talking about?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:05:57.263Z)

For this. Is that the type of thing you're talking about?

### You (2025-08-11T14:05:59.264Z)

Okay? That's a perfect example of what we need to make sure that we account for something like that. Might be very simple.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:06:06.223Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:06:07.504Z)

To put in. And then the question is, is that something we would rather use in our risk matrix, like that slider thing that I sent out? Or not, right? It's like that risk matrix is going to be like a separate page. And I don't want to have people jumping back and forth between tabs or anything like that. So we can talk about the design. But yeah. If that is a metric, any type of metric calculation.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:06:44.543Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:06:44.624Z)

I want to have documented. Because. Yeah. We need to have something that's absolutely set in stone. Saying this is how this is calculated. At any point in time. Can refer to that. To make sure that everything is done uniformly and that nobody changes any calculations, formulas, etc. Okay? Okay? Got it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:07:11.343Z)

Okay? Got it.

### You (2025-08-11T14:07:13.104Z)

So those are the things. I will go ahead and coordinate a call for the service agreement. The other ones, the account and user and the formulas. That's just a matter of getting people to take a few minutes to review them and make sure that the documentation is accurate. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:07:32.703Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:07:33.664Z)

But definitely with the service agreement. We still, no matter what we decide, have to have that. Reviewed by an attorney. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:07:46.143Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:07:47.344Z)

That kind of goes without saying. Oh, and the other thing is, that Brex tool that I sent, I sent a copy. I sent the same thing to Drew as well. I know he hasn't actually formally opened the bank account yet. Because I know we're still on the llc. So that's just something. I'm not going to push that on anybody. But it looks really interesting.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:08:13.503Z)

But it looked really interesting.

### You (2025-08-11T14:08:14.384Z)

It is.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:08:14.543Z)

I mean.

### You (2025-08-11T14:08:14.944Z)

Yeah. And they've got some really big names. Using it. So it's got to be legit. Right. What I liked is you can give everybody.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:08:22.223Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-11T14:08:26.064Z)

Or anybody you want. Basically a virtual credit card. That can be used. You can impose limits or anything. So that nobody goes out and buys a Porsche. On the credit car. But yeah. It sounded like it was. Very good option. So then I guess that brings me to my question for you. Is. Where do we stand now on the llc? Well, that's the operating agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:08:58.143Z)

Well, that's the operating agreement.

### You (2025-08-11T14:08:58.304Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:08:59.263Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-11T14:08:59.664Z)

Okay? So Drew was going through.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:00.703Z)

Okay? So Drew was going through his. I don't know where he got a better operating agreement, but he got a better operating agreement.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:04.144Z)

His. Operating, but he got a better operating agreement. It just required there were not exceptions that you had to choose.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:11.503Z)

It just required. There were, like, sections that you had to choose. You want option A or option.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:14.464Z)

You want option A or option B, and he said he was going to go through that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:16.863Z)

B. And he said he was going to go through that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:19.984Z)

But my schedule this week is much better probably than his, so I'm happy to go through that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:20.703Z)

But my schedule this week. Is much better probably than his, so I'm happy. To go through that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:26.064Z)

In a backlog with Drew, and I can shoot him a teen's message to her and ask him if he wants Stubbormp. That's me, since I have more availability this week.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:26.383Z)

If it's backlogged with Drew. And I can shoot him. And I'll shoot a team's message. To him and ask him if he wants to pivot that to me. Since I have more availability this week.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:38.624Z)

Okay? All right. That'd be great, because I know the whole bank account is dependent on getting that. So I think. And I was thinking Drew raises the question, like, okay.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:48.863Z)

And I was thinking Drew raised the question, like, okay.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:51.584Z)

Just decided to hire another engineer for how are we going to make decisions?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:51.983Z)

We just decided to hire another engineer, so how are we going to make decisions?

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:55.904Z)

Like that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:56.863Z)

Like that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:09:57.584Z)

My thought is in the first 12 months, things like that just required because we're still going to be so small.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:09:58.383Z)

My thought is, in the first 12 months, Things like that just require, because we're still going to be so small, are just going to require the five of us to agree.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:03.424Z)

Or just going to require the five of us to agree? Right. And then here. What's working with formalized? We will figure out. We'll have a budget.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:08.383Z)

Right. And then at the end of a year, when we're more formalized, we will figure out we'll have a budget. Then.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:16.144Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:16.863Z)

Right. And they'll be. You'll be able to work within your budget.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:17.744Z)

You'll be able to work within your budget. If it's above your hundred forty to go, get approval.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:20.303Z)

If it's above your budget. You'll need to go get approval.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:22.864Z)

Something along those lines.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:23.903Z)

Something along those lines.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:24.944Z)

Yeah, exactly. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:27.583Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:27.744Z)

All right. Yeah. Anything else on your side? Well, I don't know if this is right to the occasion.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:36.383Z)

Well, I don't know if this rises to the occasion, but I have these. I have certain individuals in my mind that are in the hospitality industry.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:39.104Z)

But I have certain individuals and what kinds that are in hospitality industry. That are tech oriented or may tech investment.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:45.743Z)

Industry that our tech oriented or have made tech investments.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:50.064Z)

And so I reached out to a company called Ryman.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:10:50.223Z)

And so I reached out to a company called Ryman because they're invested in Fifth Wall. And I could see that they'd actually did look at my profile, my LinkedIn profile, after I sent the nice email to them.

### You (2025-08-11T14:10:53.824Z)

Because they're invested in football. And I can see that they actually didn't look at my profile, my LinkedIn profile, after I signed the nice email to them.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:04.543Z)

So I don't even know why I'm telling you that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:04.864Z)

I didn't know why I'm telling you that. Because I took. I was just sitting there, and I'm like, oh, just do it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:07.103Z)

Because I took. I was just sitting there, and I'm like, oh, just do it.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:09.104Z)

What? Does it hurt?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:09.823Z)

Diane. What? Does it hurt? To just send an email to.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:11.664Z)

To.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:14.943Z)

The cheap operating officer. There's small. I mean, they're big in that they own big resort, but they're small.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:14.944Z)

Offer. They're bigger than they own big resorts. But they're small company. And so I. Saturday morning, I did that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:21.503Z)

Company. And so I. Saturday morning, I did that, and I was.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:23.184Z)

And when I thought that he looked at my LinkedIn profile.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:25.823Z)

When I saw that he looked at my LinkedIn profile.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:27.904Z)

At least I caught his attention.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:28.863Z)

At least I caught his attention. Yeah. And we have this. I guess the other thing I've been thinking about. I don't know what everyone's opinion is of this.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:39.984Z)

But as we go back and seek our precede capital.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:40.783Z)

But as we go out and seek our pre seed capital, I think we're going to have to, like, it's not going to be like a fun.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:46.224Z)

It's not going to be like a fun. That closes.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:49.183Z)

That closes.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:50.544Z)

There will come probably.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:51.423Z)

There will come. Will have probably one initial investor. That will be the first investor.

### You (2025-08-11T14:11:55.584Z)

Semester. And we're going to need to take the money from him or her because working capital.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:11:57.743Z)

And we're going to need to take the money from him or her because we need working capital.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:03.584Z)

To go on not being paid.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:03.823Z)

Like you, and I can't continue to go on.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:05.664Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:05.743Z)

Not being paid.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:06.464Z)

Needs to be able to get paid.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:07.023Z)

Right. Vinod needs to be able to get paid.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:08.784Z)

And so all my real estate experience has been that you start investing on enclosed fund. But we have to do this like investor by investor by an investor.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:09.503Z)

And so all my real estate experience has been that you started investing when you close a fund. But I don't know. I think we have to do this investor by investor. By investor.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:21.344Z)

Or else will die because we have no working capital.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:23.263Z)

Or else we'll die. Because we have no working capital.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:24.544Z)

Right. Yeah. Asab, right?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:39.263Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:43.264Z)

I do feel positive when I find a handful of investors.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:44.383Z)

But I think I feel positive we're going to find a handful of investors. One of the.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:51.424Z)

The reception has been great.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:12:53.023Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And then when we talk about AI tonight.

### You (2025-08-11T14:12:59.984Z)

Tonight. At 5:30. I'm going to need to make sure I also put something in the bucket.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:13:02.623Z)

At 5:30. I'm going to need to make sure I also put something in the budget.

### You (2025-08-11T14:13:05.184Z)

For that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:13:07.023Z)

For that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:13:07.664Z)

Would be a good time for those of us to talk about what kind of placeholder we want as a budget for it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:13:08.223Z)

And so it'll be a good time for us to talk about what kind of placeholder we want. In the budget.

### You (2025-08-11T14:13:13.664Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:13:14.063Z)

For it.

### You (2025-08-11T14:13:15.424Z)

Yeah. I think there's a little less urgency about that. Than when I sent it out because I had a conversation with a Vinod, and that's actually kind of what triggered this request for the third engineer. Because he pointed out that, yeah, I mean, we definitely should have somebody. And again, whether it's an engineer who can code or a product manager who's built AI in the past and can make sure that we're doing the right thing, We can make that decision, but before we do anything like that, We have to make sure that we've got somebody on the engineering team. Who can make sure that everything is set up and doesn't break or crash or make sure that we can do everything or get everything done.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:14:04.303Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-11T14:14:07.104Z)

That needs to be make sure that everything is set up properly. It's like because Raj and Siobhan are coders. They can build things. But they're not really database administrators. Or who has had experience. I thought that was good. So this isn't something that we have to make a decision right away. I'm just that we just need to plant the seed.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:14:34.543Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:14:37.264Z)

We could even maybe cancel the 530 call and just discuss it as a team.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:14:39.263Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-11T14:14:41.744Z)

But if you want. I still think it's a good one.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:14:43.583Z)

No. I would like to keep it because this is the other reason is I'm working on that pitch deck.

### You (2025-08-11T14:14:50.864Z)

I want to make sure that opinions about this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:14:51.743Z)

And so I want to make sure that and Mark will have a lot of opinions about this, but I want to try to at least mentally get it down on paper ourselves first, which is how are we going to. You know what I mean?

### You (2025-08-11T14:14:54.544Z)

But I want to try to get down on paper. Ourselves first. Which is how do we explain how we're going to AI in a way that resonates with tech savvy?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:06.303Z)

How do we explain how we're going to use AI in a way that resonates with tech savvy investors?

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:11.584Z)

Investors. But doesn't box us into something.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:16.143Z)

But doesn't box us into something.

Does this make sense?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:19.663Z)

Does this make sense? We're going to need to explain it. In tech speak, but not box us in so that we have some flexibility of which way we want to go.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:24.064Z)

But. So that we have some flexibility. On which way we want to go. And how we want to prioritize and things like that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:31.743Z)

And how we want to prioritize and things like that.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:33.664Z)

So I would like to keep it. Because I would like to get the pitch deck done.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:36.143Z)

So I would like to keep it because I would like to get the pitch deck done by Friday.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:37.424Z)

By Friday, and then. Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:41.263Z)

And then everyone can review it.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:41.584Z)

So. No, that's definitely fine. Yeah. And the sales stack.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:47.823Z)

Yeah. In the sales deck, too. I mean, we did Mark A. Drew all of his thoughts.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:51.344Z)

Thoughts. Dramatically. So that. That looks great.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:55.183Z)

Drew it through this really great AI system. So the deck looks great.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:56.544Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:15:59.263Z)

But it doesn't flow well.

### You (2025-08-11T14:15:59.824Z)

Conversation. And so that has to get worked on that together.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:02.143Z)

In conversation. And so that has to get worked on. Mark and I need to work on that together.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:06.464Z)

As well. Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:09.263Z)

As well. Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:13.664Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:13.743Z)

Cool. Well, then we will talk at 5:30. Yes. It's a ton of progress.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:19.184Z)

Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:22.143Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We'll talk at 5:30.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:23.504Z)

I think what I'm going to do for our meeting with Drew is what works good for you.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:25.823Z)

Thanks. Howard.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:28.944Z)

All right. Do you have any times that don't work for you? I check my calendar. Oh, yeah, that reminds me. That's another thing I think we need to talk about is how can we get visibility into everybody's calendar?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:36.143Z)

Let me check my calendar.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:43.744Z)

I know that. You know, if people share their calendar on Outlook, I think it would be visible.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:16:46.063Z)

Oh, yes.

### You (2025-08-11T14:16:52.944Z)

Like on the teams site. I've been using the calendar on the teams to schedule meetings because it automatically goes with the teams or whatever. But I don't. I can't see other people's calendar like I would in a normal company.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:09.263Z)

If we were an actual company. Yes.

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:12.464Z)

InnVestAI set up. I don't know why.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:12.623Z)

We should talk about that on Tuesday.

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:17.344Z)

He was some login issues. And stuff that I didn't encounter. So I don't know. I also may need your help with trauma because I created a Trollo account a long time ago with my Gmail. And then when I tried to go into Trello with InnVestAI, it doesn't recognize me.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:28.783Z)

I also may need your help with Trello because I created a Trello account a long time ago with my Gmail. And then when I try to go into Trello with InnVestAI doesn't recognize me.

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:39.104Z)

And I think when I can get into trouble,

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:41.823Z)

And I think when I can get into trouble, it's still the old, old one.

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:42.144Z)

It's still the old one I created.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:46.303Z)

I created.

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:46.784Z)

There have been a lot that came from Atlanta or from conflict.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:17:49.183Z)

Would there have been a Login that came from Atlantisan or from Confluence or something like that?

### You (2025-08-11T14:17:51.504Z)

Something like that. Your trello is atlassian. So if you've got an. If you. If you log in with an InnVestAI, you would want to use your Atlassian, which is the confluence. It is confusing. But I also think you could go to your board in Gmail and then share it. With your InnVestAI so that when you log in with your Invest AI account name, you should be able to open up that board, okay? Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:18:29.183Z)

Okay? Okay? I'll know. I'll figure it out.

### You (2025-08-11T14:18:32.144Z)

In the past. It's an extra step, but at least that way you can.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:18:32.783Z)

I'll work on it.

### You (2025-08-11T14:18:37.904Z)

Work on it. From either account. All right. So my calendar is today starting.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:18:43.583Z)

Okay? All right. So my calendar. Is today starting at around.

### You (2025-08-11T14:18:51.904Z)

### You (2025-08-11T14:19:24.784Z)

All right, so let me send out an invite. For one o'clock. And I'll just let Drew know that if that doesn't work, Let me know. And then I can coordinate it that way. Perfect. Okay. Okay? Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-11T14:19:40.143Z)

Perfect.

### You (2025-08-11T14:19:40.784Z)
