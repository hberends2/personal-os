### Guest (2025-09-10T18:30:54.040Z)

Good. How are you?

### You (2025-09-10T18:30:56.697Z)

Well.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:30:58.360Z)

How was your weekend?

### You (2025-09-10T18:31:00.617Z)

Not bad, not bad. It was actually very cool here. And ended up. Warming up a little bit. On Sunday afternoon and Monday.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:31:15.640Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-09-10T18:31:16.377Z)

Yeah, it was pretty nice. How about yours?

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:31:21.480Z)

I was still recovering from my wisdom tooth, but it looks now. But I still have a little jaw pain, so I'm gonna go to the doctors.

### You (2025-09-10T18:31:24.697Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:31:33.720Z)

Later today to just check on it. But, yeah, all is good. And it's like. I think Indian summer is starting to kick in in San Francisco. So if you feel warmer here as well, which I don't. I mean, I love summer, but the thing is, my house doesn't have ac, so I'll be suffocating.

### You (2025-09-10T18:31:57.257Z)

How warm is warm.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:01.320Z)

How warm is warm? Like 80. 80 and above. It can get up to 100, I think, like maybe in the afternoon. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:16.937Z)

What it's supposed to be like today in the 80s.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:26.920Z)

Sorry. What was your question? Is ad really high?

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:32.697Z)

How it's supposed to be today.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:36.040Z)

Oh.

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:36.057Z)

In the 80s.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:38.520Z)

I think so. It might be, actually. Hello?

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:42.537Z)

We'll call. Hey, mark.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:43.480Z)

Hey, lar. Hi. How are you?

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:44.057Z)

Thanks for joining us.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:46.680Z)

How's it going? I'm good. Nice to finally meet you. Nice to meet you as well. I've heard a lot of great things about you from Howard.

### You (2025-09-10T18:32:55.097Z)

Yeah. I was thinking that we've got an introduction call here, but I think Mark knows an awful lot about you already. I know. Diane mentioned it. I mentioned it as well.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:32:55.960Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yes.

### You (2025-09-10T18:33:07.817Z)

Let me just quickly catch everybody up to where we are. So, Mark, as you're aware, Carrie interned for me at redIQ. Did a fantastic job. Unfortunately, we had a hiring freeze. In Berkadia in redIQ at the time that her internship ended. So we weren't able to bring her on full time, but she actually continued working for us for a while on a part time basis. Until she did find another job. Ultimately, But I did reach out to her. See if she would be interested in helping this out on a part time basis and who knows, could evolve into a full time job. Carrie does a very, very good job with marketing material. Go to market. And since she was with us at redIQ for quite a while, she is familiar with a lot of the real estate industry terminology, things like that, so I think she would be a great help. And so, Carrie, Mark, as I mentioned to you before, he is really going to be working with Drew and would be responsible for a lot of the sales. Work that we're going to be doing marketing. And I think I've mentioned to you last time that you and I spoke that he will be attending a conference the first week of October. So I was hoping that in addition to working on the logo, Mark might be able to utilize you for getting some material ready for that. So I'm going to turn it over to you, Mark, if you want to go ahead and maybe give her a little bit more on your background. And then we can talk about what potential projects she can help with.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:35:09.720Z)

Yeah. No, thank you. Hi, Carrie. I've been in the hotel industry for over 30 years. And, you know, I've done a lot of different things during that period. Spent 20 years on the advisory side of the business, helping folks raise. Raise money for hotels. And then developed a number of hotels in New York. And have been an active investor in hotels and some hotel related technology. Over the past couple of years. And have gotten to know Howard and the team over the past, what has it been, six months now? I'm losing track of time. Six months or so. And, you know, I think we're creating something that really has the potential.

### You (2025-09-10T18:35:45.257Z)

Six months.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:35:49.800Z)

To transform the industry. The hotel industry, that is, you know, hotels are always sort of, they're forgotten, real estate type. And, you know, there's a lot of technology that's been developed to help people that own office and multifamily. And industrial, etc. But, you know, the hotels have been somewhat forgotten. And I think InnVestAI which is the product that we're developing, really has the ability to, as I said, transform the industry. So we've been working on a deck. That tries to explain what it is the world doing. And, you know, we're hopeful that by next week at this time, We'll have something that the entire team, the five of us, really agree is the right direction. And maybe that's an opportunity for you to help us make it better. I think we all understand what it is we're trying to do, but we're trying to figure out the best way to communicate it to our potential users and ultimately to investors. And hopefully that's something that maybe you can help us with in terms of just explaining it clearly and presenting it in a user friendly way. Yeah, definitely. So what I love to do here is just to be that marketing partner who makes your lives easier. How You're. You've got the vision, Mark. Your out there selling. I can create the materials that make those conversations land. And stuff like one pagers, fires, business cards, maybe a deck you can leave behind to just make sure I'm building the right things. Mark, I'd love to hear a bit about those upcoming conferences. Who's usually in the room more? Investor brokers, lenders? And are there more networking heavy or are people actually doing deals there that help me figure out how to position us. But we can start there if you can share a little bit more. Yeah, no, that's a great question. It's called. The conference I'm attending is the Phoenix Hotel conference. Which, as the name suggests, is in Phoenix. And it really is attended by kind of a cross section of the entire industry. So we'll have potential users there. We'll have lots of investors there. So it's about 3,000 people, many of whom can benefit from our technology. Now, there's obviously a lot of talk about technology and AI and sort of how it could be utilized in the hotel world. Right. So I think that part of our message. Is to kind of explain to everyone, obviously, what makes our product different. And one of the things that I've struggled with, candidly, is that. There are dozens of companies that do one or two of the things that we do. But our platform InnVestAI really is all encompassing. So it does 10 or 15 different things. Ultimately, not today, but as we continue to build it out, And the question is, how do we explain to people that we really can't be compared to one product or another product because we're kind of going to be the all encompassing. Product. And I think that's where maybe where you could really help us sort of articulate that vision and that mission. Because I think that users or investors, they always try to compare you to someone and just so that they can sort of understand it. And there's so many buzzwords out there and so much discussion about this all encompassing sort of AI thing. That everyone's trying to understand. And how do we differentiate ourselves? And how do we come up with a concise marketing story? That really shows kind of all the things that we ultimately intend to build over the Next. Call it 36 months. I don't want to over promise, but 36 months. Is that a good. But that is something that I think about because there's so much out there. And how do we differentiate ourselves? How do we articulate the message? And as I'm sure you know, 99% of the world suffers from ADD, right? So unless you can articulate your message in 30 seconds, you kind of lose the attention of the recipient. So I'd love to spend some time with you and maybe figure out your thoughts on how to best do that. Yeah, definitely. We can definitely create some compare analysis for external facing materials. Another question I had was, I guess from your perspective, When you're in these conversations, what's, like, one thing you wish you had maybe in the back of your pocket to hand over? What would make it easier for you? Yeah. You know, I think if we had kind of like a proverbial one pager. Where we kind of talk about, you know, what the product is today, what it's ultimately going to be. You know, 36 months from now and kind of what the applications are, you know, over time. You know, one of the biggest challenges that we have. Is that the hotel industry has always been very averse to new technology, and everyone has kind of set they'll do analytics in hotels. You know, the same way that I did it back in the. I don't want to scare you, but in the late 90s, When I came into the industry. So, you know, how do you get people comfortable? Changing their behavior. And, you know, I think that's gonna be our biggest challenges, right? Because we're asking people to just do things in a way that's initially uncomfortable for them. You know, I think once they give us a try, they'll realize that we're lives a lot easier. But, you know, getting them to take that first step. In my experience, is always the hardest part. So, you know, we're gonna have to sell to both junior people who are actually doing the work. And also they're kind of their bosses and their investors who are gonna actually write the checks. And, you know, how do we kind of come up with a message? That resonates with both audiences. Right. And you could be spanning 40 years of age in that audience. Right. So the message has got to be concise for both their 60s and 70s. Okay. So I think that's gonna be one of our biggest challenges, is just getting people comfortable. To take a leap of faith and give us a try. Now, of course, we all have known these people for a long time, right? So we come in with a lot of credibility. But it's still getting people comfortable. To change what's familiar with what's familiar. Right. It's like getting. People were getting an Uber, an Uber car for the first time. As opposed to kind of their acts. Right. And just how do you get people to sort of try something new? And again. It's not the first time. People have had to do that, but I think that's going to be one of our biggest challenges. Yeah, definitely. Just to take a step back, I'm going to finalize the logo first. Who should I kind of bring that up to? But I just shoot that over to you, Howard or Diane? I guess who's kind of making the final decision. S. As I present the marketing with.

### You (2025-09-10T18:43:28.137Z)

For the logo. Just send it to me and I'll set up a time to review it with everybody. Probably be the easiest way.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:43:33.560Z)

Okay? Okay. And do you Persona. Like profiles are set. Yeah. I'm laughing because we have. We kind of have like, five or six different customers. And that's one of the things that we talk about a lot on our regular calls. So, you know, the good news is that once we sort of become a known entity, there's so many different applications for our platform. But there's. There are a lot of potential users. Okay, if you can send me that, that would be great. I can start utilizing that part of creating, like, as I create the one pager. And if you guys also have the kind of like a brief about the mvp. Maybe. Howard, I think you might have that. And you can send that over so I can start writing, drafting something for the one pager. Yeah, and we've been working on a summary deck. Which, you know, we presented to the team last night and, you know, hopefully by early next week, You know, we'll have kind of the, like a 10 pager that walks through kind of our initial thoughts on a story. I'm sure you can do a better job than we did, but it will give you a sense of, kind of the direction that. That we're moving in. Okay, cool. Based on that, I can start pulling together a draft. One pager, even, maybe a simple deck for you guys to use at those conferences. I can also mock up business cards if you guys like something more tangible to give out. If that's something that you guys feel, you guys need. People still use business cards. Every time I talk to someone that's under the age of 30 and I ask them for a business card, they look at me like I'm crazy. Happy to hear you use the phrase business card. Because it's getting a lot of strange looks. I mean, I guess people now are, like, sort of zapping their phones, or is that the. You know, I'm not. Ironically, the mystery technology is. Howard can tell you. So, you know, it just. It seems like that's more of a thing these days. Yeah, I know. My partner uses them, too. So there are a bunch of folks who like the traditional approach. That could be an option. I prefer the business card, don't get me wrong. But I just. I feel like if I'm talking to a certain audience, You know, they just. They're not even sure what a business card is anymore. Yeah. I mean, we can prepare for both. So we have. We can cater to both. But just so we're aligned, do you want me to own tracking deliverables like sitting at my simple project tracker so or do you guys prefer we keep it more loose for now? Either way works. Just want to. Keep things like centralized and also moving smoothly. I can also create digital or physical business cards.

### You (2025-09-10T18:46:43.977Z)

Yeah. Well. I mean, the business cards totally up to Mark. I don't know. We don't really have a formal budget put together for any of this. Maybe if he's got a one pager that has the InnVestAI information on it, we want to make sure it's got Mark's contact information. For a conference like that, I think that probably would be sufficient.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:47:15.560Z)

Yeah. I mean, what I'm thinking is that, you know, I'm probably gonna have, you know, dozens of conversations at this conference letting people know we're doing. And it would be maybe great, you know, that night to go back to my room and maybe just send someone, like a follow up email and just say, you know, Howard, great catching up with you today. Here's a brief summary of what we're doing. Let's set up a demo with my team, you know, over the next couple of weeks. That would sort of be because no one really wants to carry around a piece of paper, per se. But it would be great to just have a follow up, you know, right after I meet with people and just, you know, give them something. So that we keep the momentum alive. Yeah, that works. And if you have any examples of, like, formats that you've seen prior in previous conferences that you've had, like, feel free to send over those examples as well, and maybe I can tweak those to, like, work around and faster as well. All right, let's see if I could find something like that. Yeah, sounds good. I guess next steps from here is if you guys can send over some examples of the one pager step you had and some kind of the background like MVP of the product and in some like very good selling points. For InnVestAI that would be very helpful for me. And I can start doing the draft and I think we could do maybe. When is the October, the conference October. I'm sorry. Getting old. It is october. Sixth through the eighth. Six to eight. So, yeah, let's try to get in, like, the first draft, and I think we could do maybe, like. Yeah, let's do a first draft, and if we need to do iterations, I can definitely work on that until it's more polished. So we can get it out before you attend a conference. And will you be only attending that, or as Diane also attending that as well? Yeah, I'll be there by myself. Sounds good. Okay, let's try to get that before October. Six, right? Yeah. So next up, I can, like, I can send a recapy email so you guys both. So it's more clear on what I need from you guys as well, and we can go from there. How does that sound? Sounds like a plan.

### You (2025-09-10T18:49:51.417Z)

Yep. I can. I can send you our Persona document that has seven, six or seven different Personas. Just so you can get familiar with it. I also have a high level.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:50:02.440Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-10T18:50:06.937Z)

Technical document on the InnVestAI overall. That'll probably give you an idea of the tool itself. I don't know. What else did you say you needed?

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:50:22.200Z)

Yeah. If it has the mvb sorry as her MVP been built out yet? Howard if it has, I will also like to kind of go through the onboarding process and like play around with it or maybe have a sandbox of some sort.

### You (2025-09-10T18:50:38.457Z)

Yeah, well, it's being developed right now. So that's probably going to come in under the wire. But I think there's enough that we could probably get some screenshots of that or screenshots of the of the POC if we want to have a couple of them under, but we'll probably need more of an infographic type. Especially if we're going to try to keep it to a one pager. You know, maybe. Maybe the workflow showing automated processing of the documents. Populating a database. AI generated summaries. You know, a few things like that. Just. Just kind of hitting the highlights. You know, and during the conversations, I think LARC can kind of fill in some of the stuff that's actually not on the page yet. But let's. Let's go ahead and start with that, and then we can flesh it out as we start getting some more information ready.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:51:34.520Z)

Yeah, sounds good. And if there's any buzzwords or jargons that, like, you feel like it would capture our users, feel free to send that over to me because I know we didn't really work in the hospitality when I was working at redIQ, so let me know if there's any jargon or buzzwords. Feel free to let me know. That would also be very helpful when I think about the SEO part of it, when I do email marketing campaigns down the line. Yeah, I mean, I would, you know, I know we're pressed for time. But if you give us until next, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, we'll have this little summary deck that we're putting together, and we should have, you know, hopefully support from our whole team. And I think that when we get. When we give you that, you know, 12 or 13 page document, I think that'll give you a lot of what you're looking for.

### You (2025-09-10T18:52:22.457Z)

Yeah, good point.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:52:26.680Z)

Do duplicate work. So I think it's all gonna be in there. I just don't wanna give it to you now because of it changes. Then you're gonna have to sort of do it again. But it's definitely in progress. I think we're probably 70% of the way there now. Okay. Amazing. All right, sounds good. I look forward to getting that document. And thank you so much, Howard, for setting up this call.

### You (2025-09-10T18:52:46.457Z)

Yeah, my pleasure.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:52:48.280Z)

Yeah. And, Carrie, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly with anything. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-10T18:52:53.417Z)

Did you guys want to schedule, you know, maybe 15 minute catch up on a weekly basis? Mark, do you have a time you could set up a standing call with Carrie?

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:53:04.120Z)

Probably best. I mean, we're meeting as a team again. Next Tuesday. So maybe if we did something Wednesday. That would make sense. Maybe like, Wednesday, midday. So I do work full time for Ingot. Let me just double check. Sometimes the meetings move around, but Wednesdays work best for you. Is that what I'm hearing? I'm just saying we're meeting again as a team on Tuesday. So I don't want to send you anything until the team signs off on us. You don't have to do double work. So that's why I'm like, Wednesday makes sense just in terms of when we can probably say, hopefully we can get it to you on Tuesday, but if not Tuesday, definitely by Wednesday. And then maybe when we talk, we could review it together online. Okay? But it could be Thursday. But it's better for you. I'm just saying we're going to meet Tuesday, so anytime after next Tuesday would be good. Anytime, athlete. Next Tuesday, okay? If you can. Sorry. If you can send me your free availability, I can just double check. Next week. Okay, yeah. Just let me know what works for you, and I'll try to work around your schedule. My schedule tends to be a little fluid and always subject to change, so I'm actually traveling. Monday and Tuesday. So my schedule is going to be a little bit crazy, but I'll make the time. This is a high priority for me. Okay, Sounds good. Okay, well, just fine. I'll email you.

### You (2025-09-10T18:54:31.577Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:54:35.080Z)

It sounds good.

### You (2025-09-10T18:54:35.737Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:54:36.280Z)

Excellent.

### You (2025-09-10T18:54:36.777Z)

All right, thanks, everybody.

### Guest (2025-09-10T18:54:37.880Z)

Nice to meet you, Gary. Thank you, Howard, for setting this up.

### You (2025-09-10T18:54:40.857Z)

Much.
