### Guest (2025-07-02T15:17:17.049Z)

like because I saw the point the point where you can draw x amount

### You (2025-07-02T15:17:19.269Z)

in consulting revenue.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:17:20.849Z)

consulting revenue

### You (2025-07-02T15:17:22.139Z)

So I don't know where to go with me.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:17:22.939Z)

So I I don't know where to go, but maybe just spend a little bit time if just to start the call off.

### You (2025-07-02T15:17:24.889Z)

Spend a little bit of time to to start the call off, if that's alright, talking me about, like, what

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:17:29.059Z)

If that's alright, talking to me about, like, what

### You (2025-07-02T15:17:30.159Z)

like, how do think the ideal

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:17:31.879Z)

like, how you think the ideal structure is for you.

### You (2025-07-02T15:17:32.409Z)

structure is for you? I'm still talking to some financial advisers. But to to just kinda give you the high level overview of the email that I sent, If I elect to start drawing Social Security benefits, I can earn up to $23,400 outside of the benefits. Okay. Once you exceed that,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:18:02.509Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:18:05.179Z)

they reduce the benefits $1 for every $2 you earn. So as long as I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:18:13.549Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:18:14.479Z)

as long as my income is equal to or less than $23.04, then you can collect both. So that would allow me to do this full time. I wouldn't have to try to find another job on the side, which I haven't had any anyway. So

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:18:38.389Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:18:39.519Z)

you know, it's like It's not a good job market. No. It's like, why job working.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:18:41.859Z)

It's not a good job market. It's a it's a terrible job market.

### You (2025-07-02T15:18:44.019Z)

And So the the the timing is actually very good because, you know,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:18:45.309Z)

I know.

### You (2025-07-02T15:18:48.299Z)

I I don't know if you've ever looked into the benefits or not, but with Social Security, you know, the four for the year I was born, the the official retirement age is 67. So that's when you get theoretically 100% of your benefits. And if you draw earlier, you know, the the amount goes down. If you wait until 70, that's the absolute maximum so you can actually increase up until 70. But the nice thing is, once you hit full retirement, there is no cap So you can earn as much as you want in income and get your full benefits. So there's no reduction of benefits. So the whole thing is, you know, hitting that full benefit age at 67. So Fifty seven. Yeah. Got it. When you hit sixty

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:19:49.739Z)

67. Got it. Because when you hit 67,

### You (2025-07-02T15:19:51.029Z)

seven, that you can pull whatever

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:19:53.449Z)

then you can pull whatever you want from InnVestAI, and it doesn't impact

### You (2025-07-02T15:19:53.899Z)

want in the rest AI and it doesn't impact your like, it doesn't reduce the amount you can pull from Right. From Social Security. Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:19:57.909Z)

your like, it doesn't reduce the amount you can pull from from Social Security. Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:00.519Z)

So so that limit is only if you start collecting benefits before full retirement age. So the way we would probably you know, if I elect to do this is, you know, my salary would be $23.04, but we'd want to basically defer. The ban between Of the thousands of it. Right. Whatever everybody's

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:21.869Z)

Right. The the balance of it. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:26.229Z)

collecting.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:26.919Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:28.699Z)

So so, yeah, I mean, it could be you know, once I hit 67, you know, it it it could be you know, salary plus whatever was deferred The the first. Like, catch up on those. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Exactly.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:42.989Z)

Like a ketchup almost. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:44.269Z)

Okay. So then I got it. Okay. Yeah. So that's, what, three three and a half years?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:45.819Z)

Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:50.759Z)

So a base of

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:52.929Z)

So, basically, we would be setting up some sort of, like, almost like

### You (2025-07-02T15:20:53.109Z)

would be setting up some sort of, like, almost like we would be setting to be safe.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:20:58.439Z)

we would be setting to be safe, we would be set

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:00.179Z)

Be set aside some money into it in an interest bearing account. Right? So that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:02.529Z)

aside some money into it in, like, interest bearing account

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:06.389Z)

when you hit 67, that money would be available.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:07.079Z)

Right? So that when you hit 67, that money would be available

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:09.109Z)

Available for you. Catch up on it.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:11.329Z)

for you to catch up on it.

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:12.129Z)

To make it fair for those of us who have to draw down

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:13.699Z)

To make it fair for those of us who have to draw down

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:15.739Z)

now because I would hate to

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:17.439Z)

now because I would hate to have it come out of

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:17.579Z)

have it come out out of well, I don't wanna say it. I mean, I I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:20.409Z)

out of well, I don't wanna say. I mean, I I out of profits,

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:22.459Z)

I don't know. Profit Right. We we will be profitable. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:25.259Z)

we we will be profitable. Right? But do you know what I mean, Liz? If there's zero profits,

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:26.049Z)

But you know what I mean? Like, if there's zero profit, I don't want you to not have a an ability to pull those dollars. So I I think

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:30.019Z)

I don't want you to not have a an ability to pull those dollars. So

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:33.739Z)

probably setting up some sort of, like,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:34.699Z)

I think probably setting up some sort of, like, interest

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:36.119Z)

interest accruing account Yeah. Or something like that would be

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:38.959Z)

accruing account or something like

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:41.459Z)

probably the best.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:42.279Z)

that would be probably the best.

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:43.449Z)

Well, we we would have we would have to get with a CPA. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:45.069Z)

As I yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:48.019Z)

the bottom line is I mean, we we need it we need it anyway.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:21:50.229Z)

Yep. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:21:51.759Z)

Yeah. But the the the information did refer to don't remember what, but but there's different ways of setting up stock options and equity. So and that would affect the entire team. So it's like, how are we going to

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:06.329Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:10.159Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Split

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:10.619Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:11.619Z)

the money? Is it going to be you just get stock options? Are you gonna get actual disbursements? Each is going to be treated differently from a tax And so Right. You know, that that's gonna have a big termination as well.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:24.649Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:27.279Z)

So it's not only what what are we gonna do for for my deferment, but also To everyone. Right? Ones. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:34.109Z)

To everyone. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:36.169Z)

And I think you I I I hope everyone has heard me say this.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:37.209Z)

And I think you've I I I hope everyone has heard me say this.

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:40.519Z)

Because to me, I want this to be I view us all as

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:42.179Z)

Because to me, I want this to be I view us all as

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:44.309Z)

absolutely equal in this process. Like, we each bring a very unique skill

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:45.979Z)

absolutely equal in this process. Like, we each bring a very unique

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:49.279Z)

set. Mhmm. And so,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:50.469Z)

skill set. And so while we each may need something a little bit different,

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:50.829Z)

while we each may need something a little bit different, my hope is in the end, that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:55.439Z)

my hope is in the end that

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:55.959Z)

we're I mean, that we're all

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:57.589Z)

we're I mean, that we're all

### You (2025-07-02T15:22:57.849Z)

and I'm assuming through it as too. Right? Through the shift.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:22:59.499Z)

and I'm assuming Drew in this too. Right? If Drew doesn't change if he doesn't change, but we all are

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:00.869Z)

Did change, but we all are 20% Right. We figure out the right structure for everyone.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:03.929Z)

20% We figure out the right structure for everyone.

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:08.359Z)

I you know, I the only thing I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:10.289Z)

I you know, I the only thing I

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:11.839Z)

agree to you or me is okay. We need someone

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:13.579Z)

and we you're right. We need a CPA. We need someone

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:15.159Z)

or that can help advise us on this.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:16.819Z)

or that can help advise us on this, and we probably need some sort of fraction

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:17.699Z)

You know, probably some sort of fractional CFO at some point

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:21.339Z)

CFO at some point too early on.

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:21.559Z)

to early on. But the only thing I have that I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:24.419Z)

But the only thing I have that I can even compare this to is when I worked for

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:24.909Z)

need to compare this to is when I worked for a a sponsor, a real estate sponsor, and we would

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:29.389Z)

sponsor, a real estate sponsor, and we would do our deals

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:31.269Z)

do our deal We would essentially it would be

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:34.059Z)

we would essentially

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:35.759Z)

we could front

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:35.859Z)

it would be

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:36.689Z)

family money in, which our team was part of that. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:36.909Z)

we put friends and family money in, which our team was part of that.

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:40.569Z)

That was 10%. And then go find a capital partner for 90% of the equity. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:41.369Z)

Right? And that was 10%. And then we'd go find a capital partner for 90% of the equity.

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:47.279Z)

Obviously, there's debt in there. Right? But

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:48.839Z)

Obviously, there's debt in there, right, but which which we don't have here.

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:49.699Z)

which we don't have here. Then when you get to the point where you sell the hotel in five to seven years,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:53.029Z)

And then when you get to the point where you sell the hotel in five to seven years,

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:56.169Z)

what what's happened

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:23:57.799Z)

well, what's happening is essentially you first to get to something like an 11% preferred equity return. And once you hit that,

### You (2025-07-02T15:23:57.829Z)

is essentially the first to get to something like a 11%. Preferred app. Return, once you hit that, disbursement starts to go out. And so that you are then

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:07.579Z)

disbursements start to go out. And so then you are getting disbursements

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:08.929Z)

disbursements on the investment. Right? Yep. And then there's

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:11.139Z)

on the investment. Right? And then there's another hurdle that's usually something around

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:11.839Z)

another hurdle that's usually something around staff and or 18 or something like that. Yep. And and then

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:15.709Z)

17 or 18 or something like that.

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:17.829Z)

and then when you sell,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:18.729Z)

And and then and then when you sell, if they're

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:19.709Z)

if they're are certain hurdles met, that's what you get.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:22.019Z)

are certain hurdles met, that's when you get the big check

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:22.859Z)

The big check that comes, you know, the the big payday comes. Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:24:25.489Z)

that comes, you know, the the big payday comes.

### You (2025-07-02T15:24:26.799Z)

Just keep pouring money into the four zero k's and the IRA's and get the maximum benefit. You know, for for decades, that's that's always been my plan. And also being a late starter with a family and having a daughter that's still college age, I figure someone probably need a few years to pay down that debt. Yeah.

fluid. And and we'll see however it comes for us. But

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:28:49.019Z)

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:29:59.619Z)

wholeheartedly, but I'm also like, if I wanna work

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:00.219Z)

if I wanna work until I'm 70 or or beyond that,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:02.849Z)

until I'm 70 or beyond that, then I need to create

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:04.039Z)

then I need to create the path to do

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:07.709Z)

the pathway to do that

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:08.089Z)

that. Yeah. Right? And I see that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:10.309Z)

Right? And I see this as a pathway

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:10.339Z)

there's a pathway potentially to do that. It it creates

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:13.339Z)

potentially to do that. It it creates

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:14.349Z)

a runway at work.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:16.009Z)

a runway of work

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:17.379Z)

Because each year, they get discrimination is gonna get worse. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:19.239Z)

Because each year, the age discrimination is gonna get worse. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:21.899Z)

It is. Yeah. It's nothing that we can do about it, unfortunately. So no. I'm I'm that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:23.809Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:27.709Z)

that's that's really why I'm kinda just willing to go with this as far as it'll take me because that's I if I had my way, I would never send out another resume or have another job interview in my life. I I I'm to the point where I'm just done done with that. And

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:30:45.189Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:30:47.609Z)

it's the same thing. And and know, I go and I look at all of the people that are in a similar position to where I was at at at Red IQ, they're all in their thirties. Twenties. You know, you go to these calls, and you don't see anybody with gray hair and everything. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:03.039Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:05.439Z)

It it is it is a very age sensitive industry in the tech side. So so, yeah, if if that's what I'm thinking too is if if I can't make this work, then I'm basically SOL, and I have to live off of whatever I can do. You know, find part time work, you know, even even on the

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:28.379Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:30.999Z)

consulting side, it's just you know, I've I get a few gigs here and there, but really nothing to speak of. So so yeah. Well, I think I think we are in the same same situation. Same situation.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:43.149Z)

Same situation. This is going to work

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:44.899Z)

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:51.049Z)

team. It's the right moment in time. It's the right problem.

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:51.829Z)

It's the right problem. It's a niche industry. I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:56.219Z)

It's a niche industry. I mean,

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:57.039Z)

the only thing that feel like

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:31:59.039Z)

the only thing that I feel like

### You (2025-07-02T15:31:59.059Z)

could cause us to fail is if we ourselves

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:32:00.769Z)

could cause us to fail is if we ourselves somehow

### You (2025-07-02T15:32:02.109Z)

somehow footfall. Right? Yeah. And we fail as leaders.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:32:04.539Z)

### You (2025-07-02T15:32:25.569Z)

That's scary.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:32:27.189Z)

That's good.

### You (2025-07-02T15:32:27.559Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:33:28.289Z)

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:33:47.989Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:33:48.899Z)

path over the last couple of

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:01.819Z)

days. About how to get funded.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:03.979Z)

days about how to get funded, who to go to, you know, like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:04.149Z)

Who would go to or email it. Kind of sorts some of that stuff out. I haven't looked at the most recent video, but I do understand you're getting to the point where

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:08.349Z)

trying to sort some of that stuff out. I haven't looked at the most recent video. But I do understand you're getting to the point where you're complete

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:12.549Z)

you're complete you're you're the model on your computer and

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:15.379Z)

you're you're the model on your

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:16.559Z)

implode. Explode. Right? I'm joking. They have to go

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:17.449Z)

computer's gonna implode, explode. Right? I'm joking.

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:20.269Z)

into the cloud. Right? The the node is is, you know, sadly, we're

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:21.369Z)

It has to go into the cloud. Right? Vin the node

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:24.339Z)

He gets sort of his part time job, so his time is

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:24.949Z)

is is, you know, sadly working. He has to work this part time job.

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:27.359Z)

limited Yeah. In what he could do. But it's kind of like that's what has to happen.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:28.449Z)

His time is limited in what he can do. But it's kind of like that's what has

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:31.229Z)

Next. Yeah. And

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:32.819Z)

to happen next.

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:33.689Z)

we do math as

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:34.499Z)

And

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:35.789Z)

math to your

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:36.309Z)

we do math is math to your point. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:36.729Z)

point. Right? So the math should work out. It's more of our

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:39.819Z)

So the math should work out. It's more along the lines of did we set

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:40.629Z)

the lines that did we set the formulas up correctly for when we start testing it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:34:43.889Z)

the formulas up correctly for when we start testing it.

### You (2025-07-02T15:34:45.389Z)

Yeah. And so those are the things that I'm I'm working on. I just have to be very careful and just go one at a time. And I've I've gotten to the point now where no matter how minor of a change I need to go through everything just to make sure something that's you know, I've done some things that I thought were completely unrelated to something breaking. And it's like, well, I was working here. Why did this change? And sometimes it's just a format. Right? How did this

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:35:17.039Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:35:17.419Z)

font get big and bold and all these different other things? So

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:35:23.679Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:35:24.289Z)

most of it at this point is minor, but, yeah, it's it's not as quick. You know, it got to the point where I could put down, like, at the beginning, you know, here's a list of what I need to have done. And then the agent would go and do it. And I'd run through and then, yeah, check it. Make sure everything worked. But but it is also compartmentalized. So the pro form a section is far and away the largest And, you know, that's what I've been working on. So it's got all the metrics on the top, and then your inputs, and your calculations. But if I work on a different area, it's a totally different section of code. It's everything else. So I can continue to work on it. In fact, today, I was gonna kinda put together the model that I showed in Excel. And at least just kind of get the wire frame up so you can see the tabs and see the data.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:36:21.159Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:36:26.409Z)

And not yet get into any calculations, but we can have the input cells and everything else. So at least we can start walking through the user journey with that. And I just wanna make sure that we've got everything in the right incremental steps. So should be able to do things like that without affecting any other portion of the model. So yeah. It's just the pro form a that makes me really nervous at this point.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:36:50.309Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-02T15:36:51.519Z)

So Yeah. But you're looking said. Math is math. Right? And so, ultimately, it's just a matter of getting

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:36:55.249Z)

But you like you said, math is math. Right? And so it's just a matter of getting the formula. I I mean, just

### You (2025-07-02T15:36:58.329Z)

the formula. I I mean, just and and so now once we have pulled it up,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:37:02.769Z)

and and so now once Vinod pulls it up, then then do you have more

### You (2025-07-02T15:37:03.059Z)

then then you have more flexibility. You can and how you have another

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:37:06.779Z)

flexibility in in how you and Vinod are working on it? Because

### You (2025-07-02T15:37:07.099Z)

on it because Yeah. You have a better

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:37:10.939Z)

you have a better

### You (2025-07-02T15:37:10.939Z)

system or better

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:37:12.959Z)

system or a better, I I don't know, Canvas. I don't

### You (2025-07-02T15:37:14.119Z)

system Well Yeah. It's it it'll it it's all of the above. We would have that's what we were talking about. If, you know, we have to get on a particular database, an enterprise level database, like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or something like that.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:37:29.579Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:37:32.549Z)

So we don't have any limitations as to you know, what can be done But at the same time, the tool I'm working is a is a no code tool, where you're simply input a prompt and it writes the code what you want to do. And then you go back and you test and reiterate and keep going until you get it where you want. The problem with these tools is they are not designed for enterprise type software. You know, it's like if you go on these sites, it's like, Hey, I just created a you know, a a a a shopping list check or my little things. And so that's the problem is that it keeps writing code on top of code, and so you get really bloated. That's where I've been having trouble is, if something stops working, it's hard to find where The problem. Right? So it's not so much

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:38:34.009Z)

The problem.

### You (2025-07-02T15:38:37.119Z)

the database. It's that now Vinod who is an expert coder has to clean up the code. Okay. And so then he will go through and get rid of

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:38:47.039Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:38:50.099Z)

the junk and make it an actual enterprise level code. That functions the way it wants to or the way it should. But at the same time, are tools that are way more advanced than what I'm capable of using that would help him out. So it's not like it's going to take him a month to go line by line through thousands of lines code. He will have his assistant as well

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:17.049Z)

So

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:17.929Z)

be able to help out. So let's talk about that number sitting at the line

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:21.789Z)

so let's talk about that because we're sitting at July 2. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:22.499Z)

second. Right? And

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:26.089Z)

And

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:26.829Z)

is July 4.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:28.179Z)

July is we have the July 4 holiday. And then, honestly, we're we're in a blank in July.

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:28.739Z)

And, honestly, we're we're gonna blink if July is gonna be over. Yeah. And and there was a

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:33.149Z)

Is gonna be over. And and there is a

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:35.299Z)

process, like, even the conversations I've had to date, like, with Jerry at Arcadia,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:36.829Z)

process. Like, even the conversations I've had to date, like, with Jared Kelso at Berends and with Darice Rose at CBRE,

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:40.559Z)

and at CBRE, takes me a couple weeks to line those up.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:45.119Z)

that takes me a couple weeks to line those up. Right? Like, I I reach out,

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:45.579Z)

Right? Like, I I reach out. We have lunch. You know, sugar was great.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:49.669Z)

hey. Let's have lunch. You know? Sure. That's great. What's

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:50.569Z)

What's two weeks look like? So so we're going with this in

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:53.589Z)

two weeks look like on your schedule? So where I'm going with this is

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:54.969Z)

if we could end up minds on the streets of prep that we would

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:39:57.659Z)

if we could, in our minds, almost start to prep that we're gonna do

### You (2025-07-02T15:39:58.409Z)

do. The with the feed feedback. From the analysts in early August.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:40:01.909Z)

these get the feedback from the analysts in early August.

### You (2025-07-02T15:40:06.909Z)

I still think well, that's I like, I tried to to clarify in the call on Monday is we need to differentiate between a POC and the MVP. So the POC, can do

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:40:21.029Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:40:21.389Z)

anytime. I mean, I wouldn't even bother I wouldn't mind even getting on a call with somebody tomorrow. And then just kinda walk them through. And basically get their opinion. Are we heading in the right direction? Does this look good to you? That, would really like to get in front of people a little bit sooner. But to have them actually then log in and work on it that would be the MVP

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:40:45.889Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:40:46.909Z)

And that's that's totally dependent on Vinod. So, you know, with with him, working right now. I I you know, we'd have to pull him into the conversation and see know, how many hours can he work. Okay. That being said, you know, I've been working with him for a while, and

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:08.809Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:11.969Z)

I would see emails or chat messages at you know, 11:30 in the evening and then another one at 04:15 in the morning. It's like, okay. I think he lives off of two hours of sleep. Yeah. But I don't wanna drive him into the ground. I know. Yeah. So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:29.329Z)

Yeah. I know. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:31.299Z)

So I I know I know they'll work. Do we

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:33.599Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:33.799Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:34.349Z)

So how so how do we

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:35.269Z)

let's talk about this because, like, I don't want

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:37.199Z)

so let's let's talk about this because, like, I don't want

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:38.539Z)

to put this in front of any of the CBRE analyst until

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:41.479Z)

to put this in front of any of the CBRE analysts until

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:45.839Z)

so so what Berends tells me with CBRE is

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:48.949Z)

so so what Darice tells me was CBRE it's the brokers that we're gonna have to

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:50.919Z)

a brokers that we're gonna have to Yeah. Like, Yep. Get through. Right? They they need technology

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:41:56.119Z)

like, get through. Right? They they hate technology. They either hate it, like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:41:57.899Z)

like, you know, believe in it. Or they hate it because they're gonna lose their jobs from it. Right? Because that's a

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:01.089Z)

they don't believe in it, or they hate it that they're gonna lose their job.

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:03.479Z)

spectrum. So

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:04.799Z)

From it. Right? That's it's it's a spectrum. So she

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:04.909Z)

she she gave me a list of five panelists. Are all very

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:08.999Z)

she gave me a list of five analysts.

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:10.239Z)

different technology oriented

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:11.369Z)

Who are all very

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:12.319Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:13.309Z)

they're great, technology oriented. Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:13.749Z)

There she said, there work schedules are incredibly

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:16.929Z)

They're she said they're

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:18.239Z)

backed up.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:18.779Z)

work schedules are incredibly backed up.

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:18.919Z)

We a positive thing for all the strategies that we can present it.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:22.039Z)

Which is a positive thing for us. Right? Because if we can present a

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:22.189Z)

A tool to them, that shows them how they get through them. Work. Much faster. Yeah. That's great.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:25.119Z)

tool to them that shows them how they can get through their work much faster, that's great.

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:28.489Z)

She also would just want

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:30.089Z)

She also just warned me, you know, just be careful.

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:30.229Z)

me, you know, just be careful You you know, take too much of their time because if a broker you know, if the brokers could, like,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:35.279Z)

You you know, don't take too much of their time because if a broker you know, the brokers could, like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:38.379Z)

go up and, you know, inflame you know, frustration. And and just be cautious of that.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:41.449Z)

go up in, you know, in flames, know, frustration. You know? So just be cautious

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:43.689Z)

So in my mind, they're kind of one of the

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:45.909Z)

of that. So in my mind, they're kind of one of the last

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:46.979Z)

groups I would like to do a POC with. I'd rather do

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:50.109Z)

groups I would like to do a POC with. I'd rather do it someone

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:50.359Z)

it with someone that is truly an absolute honest to god friend. Yep. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:42:54.539Z)

that is truly an apps an honest to god friend Does that make sense yet?

### You (2025-07-02T15:42:58.469Z)

I feel that with with the on a virtual media analyst as well just because

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:00.469Z)

Okay. I feel that way with the Berecadia analyst as well just because

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:03.569Z)

of all our collective relationships, you know, the Arcadia analyst I I would want it to be when it's

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:06.789Z)

of all of our collective relationships. You know, the Berecadia analyst I I would want it to be when it's, like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:09.419Z)

like, we feel really, really good about it. Yeah. Mark's analyst friend

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:13.319Z)

we feel really, really good about it.

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:15.159Z)

they're they're like the proxy analyst that he works with. Right? So they're more

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:16.619Z)

Mark's analyst friends, they're they're like the Prakashani analyst that he works

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:19.879Z)

front They're more like in his friend group. Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:21.499Z)

with. Right? So they're more friends' friends. They're more, like, in his friend group.

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:24.149Z)

I have a couple of friends that I could ask but they were senior people, but they would do it for me. I'm confident, and they would

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:27.569Z)

I have a couple of friends that I could ask but they're more senior people, but they would do it for me. I'm confident. And they would give

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:31.569Z)

give advice on it. So I can tap into that network.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:35.319Z)

advice on it. So I could tap into that network.

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:37.749Z)

I I do know a few people that could give that kind of feedback immediately.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:41.069Z)

I I do know a few people that could give that kind of feedback immediately.

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:41.849Z)

I'm rambling, but I'm trying trying to get from July 2 to

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:45.189Z)

I'm rambling, but I'm just try I'm trying to get from July 2 to, like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:47.899Z)

like, to Labor Day. Right? Yeah. It was and then that's

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:52.689Z)

to Labor Day. Right? And maximize every

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:52.879Z)

my February every opportunity we have this summer. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:43:57.389Z)

every opportunity we have this summer.

### You (2025-07-02T15:43:58.519Z)

No. I I I agree. And we don't even need you know, I'm I'm I'm thinking three to five. Would be sufficient, at least to kind of get an idea of whether or not we are doing whether we're focused on the right area. At the beginning. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:44:16.079Z)

Great.

### You (2025-07-02T15:44:19.059Z)

I know they're gonna come up and say, oh, well, I'm not gonna use it unless it does this. Or unless it does that. You know, a lot of the things that Mark has brought up in the calls that are things that we have to do later. So Right. What I would propose

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:44:29.239Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:44:31.929Z)

is when we do these calls and step through that we also have a slide deck prepared and maybe even some mock ups for those different areas. You know, what are we gonna what's AI gonna do What are some of the other you know, like the Mark mentioned yesterday, he thought the refi portion should be in the proof of concept and things like that. So things that don't yet exist, but we know for a fact we're going to do.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:44:59.289Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:44:59.599Z)

Right. That'll kinda head off any objections of the, like, don't call me until this is ready. Right? Or don't bother me anymore because it doesn't do this or that. So Right.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:45:15.049Z)

from a dollar perspective. Yeah. Yeah. We've already started working on that. And

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:46:12.649Z)

from a dollar perspective.

### You (2025-07-02T15:46:14.189Z)

I've got a sheet that I shared earlier

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:46:14.269Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:46:16.939Z)

when we first started out with some estimates, and we're just continuing to work on that and start to actually get down at a lower level. You know, he had put in some line items I had put in some things that we've already done. And you know, right now, we're using free versions of those items. But, like, if we do have to get a license for Jira and some of those other things, that's that's in the sheet. So he's he's got a good idea of what it is we need from a hardware standpoint. For the database and things like that. We've also got we've talked about bringing on a junior developer likely based in India. So the cost is significantly less than if we have somebody based in The US and and we have some people in mind that we have previously worked with. Okay. That are very strong and

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:47:20.339Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:47:22.999Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-02T15:47:30.869Z)

be much less if we just had to hire somebody off the street but he he he would be he would be able to provide even things like, you know, what what would it cost from a salary standpoint for you know, a junior developer? Junior. Right. Oh, yeah. So I think, you know, we we've talked about that. I know with the holiday and everything, I don't think we'll have done by the end of the week, but, you know, we can Right. On it over the weekend and you know, have something early next week.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:49:03.659Z)

and Mark and I just had to duke it out on, like, who we're gonna go to, right, on as

### You (2025-07-02T15:49:06.139Z)

goes and, you know, friends and family,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:49:08.629Z)

as far as this goes. And, you know, friends and family,

### You (2025-07-02T15:49:09.129Z)

we're gonna go to angel investors, who who we're gonna go to on the

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:49:12.399Z)

we're gonna go to angel investors, who who we're gonna go to on it.

### You (2025-07-02T15:49:13.099Z)

Yeah. Along those lines, in this is only something I've been thinking about So don't take this as any type of commitment But my brother-in-law does angel investing. He started up his own or he had his own company. Sold it about yeah. About ten years ago now. I was in the process of starting my own analytics company. That I I had a a company that I had worked with on a consulting basis. That I didn't agree with the way they were putting this thing together. It was really your your typical bubble gum and duct tape. Process in the back end. And I had a way

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:50:15.859Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T15:50:16.749Z)

that could be done at a fraction of the cost of what they were doing. It fit perfectly with my background. And so my brother-in-law and one other friend was prepared to invest in it, but my wife was and is extremely risk averse And so I could not get past that point now. Have transpired with my wife where she was then involved with potential start up and now she's she has no objections to what we're doing now, so that's no longer an issue. But the long story, what I'm getting to here is I I don't know if I'm comfortable taking money from my brother-in-law. From him. Right. Yeah. I understand that. But at a minimum, he could be an

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:05.629Z)

From Tim. Right. Yeah. I understand that.

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:08.359Z)

and help us He's ordered to do that. Like, I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:11.339Z)

Right?

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:12.309Z)

I don't know how to go out and, like, someone should

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:14.139Z)

Because we're gonna need that. Like, I I don't know how to go out

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:15.279Z)

still lead a serious funding. Yeah. For

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:17.669Z)

and, like, someone has to lead a series funding.

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:17.719Z)

Right? Yeah. And and then we I mean, there's obviously the documentation and all

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:20.669Z)

Right? And and then we I mean, there's

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:22.589Z)

with them and things like that. And so

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:23.929Z)

obviously the documentation involved with it and things like that. And so

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:24.899Z)

that's something I've trying to figure out as well. Like, how how is that process? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:28.509Z)

that's something I've been trying to figure out as well. Like, how does that process

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:30.049Z)

Work? Because you all see there's

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:33.089Z)

work?

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:33.589Z)

a lead investor. Right? And then the rest follow. And that's when you pull the

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:35.529Z)

Because you always see there's this a lead investor. Right? And then the rest

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:37.779Z)

like, when you club a real estate

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:39.509Z)

follow. And that's when you club a, like, when you club a real estate investment deal, that's how it works

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:39.619Z)

investment deal, that's how it works too. Yeah. Usually, they're a lot of them. Right? One of the partners that step

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:44.479Z)

too. Usually, there's one, right, one of the partners that steps

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:45.929Z)

up and act. And kind of know, if the voice of

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:49.269Z)

up and act act and kind of, you know, is the voice of

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:51.019Z)

you know, keys. In the process. Yeah. And so

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:51:54.709Z)

DLPs in the process. And so I'm assuming it's similar.

### You (2025-07-02T15:51:54.729Z)

I'm assuming it's similar. Yeah. So I I I do wanna know, maybe I'll go and have lunch with him sometime next week or just kinda pick his brain. But the other gentleman that we were working with ten years ago, he also would be. Of potential angel investor. He has a very serious tech background. He was a consultant and a preferred provider for Microsoft. He was one of their top consulting firms that that Microsoft would reach out to. And since we are already kind of using Microsoft products, it kind of makes sense that we would probably look at Azure. So not only could he write checks, which is basically what he's doing. He's now just almost that's all he's doing is angel investing. But he could also be a very good resource just from the technical standpoint. Making sure that we get everything set up and no the ins and outs of how we could do that. So so I I I didn't know if you Yeah. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:53:16.889Z)

Yeah. No. That those are great. The

### You (2025-07-02T15:53:17.179Z)

There was somebody you were already working with that's Yep. I didn't really reach out yet, but I can Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:53:21.549Z)

Nope.

### You (2025-07-02T15:53:22.779Z)

And right, that's the key. And then I've got her

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:53:25.019Z)

No. And

### You (2025-07-02T15:53:25.629Z)

is what I want to do with things I

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:53:26.879Z)

right. That's the p and I was I this is what one of some of things I've been studying.

### You (2025-07-02T15:53:26.969Z)

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:53:31.099Z)

the persons who would be most helpful right now would be the analysts, the people who are working in Excel. Every day. Right. So comparing what

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:55:55.939Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T15:55:56.079Z)

they do in Excel, jumping back and forth between different areas, copying and pasting versus what we've got. That's where that's that's the level of feedback that I'm looking for at this point. So There are a couple of sponsor shops that are so small. They're, like, they're,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:11.289Z)

There are a couple of sponsor shops

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:12.749Z)

two people. People sponsor shops.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:14.459Z)

that are so small. They're, like, they're, like, two people sponsor shops that don't have analysts.

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:14.489Z)

That don't have analysts. Mhmm. And so well, they've also been, like, a

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:19.429Z)

And so

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:19.899Z)

deals.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:21.969Z)

they also haven't done deals. And fairness, because they're newer,

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:23.479Z)

But I think it goes Yeah. If if they're

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:26.849Z)

but they could both provide they're friends of mine and could both provide feedback.

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:28.249Z)

If they're If they're older number. Yeah. Doing it in next

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:31.819Z)

Even their older

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:32.389Z)

right now. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:33.829Z)

they're the ones, yeah, doing it in Excel right now.

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:34.369Z)

And then I guess something else. If you guys can start like, that idea is good.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:38.379Z)

And then, I guess, something else. If you guys could start the deck idea is good.

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:42.059Z)

Create something so that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:43.799Z)

That we all maybe we create

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:44.069Z)

like, a com you know, coming soon. Yeah. Right? So when we get to the

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:46.529Z)

something so that like, a coming, you know, coming soon. Right? So when we get to the point where we're doing

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:48.249Z)

point, we'll do the proof of concept with with analysts that could be clients who are dealing with that coming soon.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:52.639Z)

the proof of concept with with analysts that could be clients, we're dealing with that coming soon.

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:55.039Z)

So I like understand the idea that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:56:58.549Z)

So I, like, understand the ideas

### You (2025-07-02T15:56:59.889Z)

I can give you a blood of, like, five to 10 ideas. Yeah. What I can't

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:02.279Z)

of and I can give you a list of, like, five to 10 ideas.

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:04.489Z)

speak yet is how to explain how AI

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:07.069Z)

What I can't speak yet is how to explain how AI is

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:07.799Z)

is how we're going to be using AI on that. Right. Right. And

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:11.649Z)

how we're going to be using AI on that.

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:12.539Z)

the reason was to have it for lunch with my friend. Therese was great because she is

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:15.209Z)

And Darice was having lunch with my friend. Darice was great because

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:18.009Z)

deep into this. She's taken courses on AI, continuing education courses that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:20.779Z)

she is deep into this. She's taken courses on AI

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:24.659Z)

on AI. I think through I think it was through MIT, but it might have been another school.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:25.449Z)

like continuing education courses at on AI. I think through I think it was through MIT, but it might have been another

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:29.329Z)

She has great network. Some of her were

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:32.389Z)

school. And she has a great network.

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:33.629Z)

I quite case

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:34.819Z)

Some of her questions were,

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:35.369Z)

that part of our strategy is to collect

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:37.479Z)

I tried to make the case that part of our strategy is to collect

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:38.329Z)

enough data around hotel and investments. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:42.109Z)

enough data around hotel investments, right,

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:42.779Z)

That we could have a an outbound end

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:46.119Z)

that we could have a

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:46.509Z)

specifically specifically focused on

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:48.709Z)

an LLM specifically focused on

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:48.879Z)

hotel investment. Clean data, scrub data,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:52.609Z)

hotel investments, clean data, scrub data,

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:52.839Z)

central data. Right? Yeah. From all in I'm thinking forward a few years. Right? One this has been

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:57:56.409Z)

centralized data. Right? From all and now I'm thinking forward a few years.

### You (2025-07-02T15:57:59.579Z)

done adapt industry, we should

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:01.379Z)

Right? Once this has been adapted in the industry.

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:01.819Z)

potentially

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:05.239Z)

And potentially, we have even, like, a a module that works with

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:05.569Z)

with pro four. Pull up construction data.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:09.179Z)

with Procore to pull up all the construction data that's relevant to

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:09.429Z)

That's relevant. Hospitality. Yep. So she asked me, she said, I'm not gonna become

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:14.089Z)

So she asked me,

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:14.809Z)

combative by him. And she She was

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:16.959Z)

she said, I'm not trying to be combative, Diane.

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:17.559Z)

just she's like, but like, how how are

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:19.639Z)

And she wasn't. She was she's like, but, like, how how

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:20.539Z)

going? To use AI?

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:23.259Z)

how are you going to use AI

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:23.349Z)

Platform? And I answer that. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:25.949Z)

in this platform? And I couldn't answer that. Like,

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:26.399Z)

our we gonna be using, like, Clog and are we gonna

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:29.659Z)

are we gonna be actually using, like, Claude and

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:30.689Z)

perplexity or whatever tools are that

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:33.039Z)

are we gonna be using perplexity or whatever the tools are that exist

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:33.199Z)

exist? But to go with it. Search our proprietary LL LLM.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:37.699Z)

but to go in and search our proprietary LLM

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:38.719Z)

Create our own tool

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:41.739Z)

will we create our own

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:42.949Z)

is it

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:44.549Z)

tool like that? Like and then she also said, how are you gonna handle

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:44.579Z)

you're gonna cancel. Right. Which I couldn't answer on the spot.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:48.799Z)

hallucinations? Which I couldn't answer on the spot.

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:49.899Z)

But if you taught to, like, how

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:53.289Z)

But if you and Vinoka give some thought to, like, how we

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:54.639Z)

me. Through. And additional conversations with people about how we're

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:58:58.299Z)

you know, how we get through the the initial conversations with people

### You (2025-07-02T15:58:59.839Z)

actually used. AI in in our tools. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-02T15:59:02.519Z)

about how we're actually gonna use AI in in our tools.

### You (2025-07-02T15:59:04.859Z)

One thing well well, first off, it it doesn't really matter. If we use Claude, OpenAI, Perplexity, whoever. I mean, we we would use what's yeah. I mean, you you've heard us talk about APIs. Right? So we would use what what they call an MCP server, which is a model context protocol, which is basically just a a guideline or standardized format that all these different models use. So what you would do is you would use that MCP server to connect whichever model we want. Directly to our database. And then they also have web access. So I I would say my elevator pitch for AI is you know, number one, it's it's very simple just to say, hey. Invest. Give me an overall summary of this deal. When so when they go in and they input their deal, it would just take and write up like a something you would use in an offering memorandum or to somebody else. But at the same time, you'd have Internet access

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:00:21.099Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T16:00:23.249Z)

and you could use agents and they could also bring back market data. Where hallucinations come in is primarily when you are asking more theoretical questions. And not necessarily data questions. OpenAI, ChatGPT, they all do a great job of financial analysis. So, you know, there well, there's not really a

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:00:52.389Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T16:00:55.829Z)

if you say, you know, what is my average return and what what can I do and what you know, type of description, hallucinations aren't an issue? But we do have to be careful with the others. But number one, they, you know, hallucinations are still an issue. There's no doubt about it. But there are ways of framing the prompt and doing things to where you can greatly reduce it or even eliminate it. There's a lot of things that are being done lately So it's more on how you prompt to get that data to to help reduce hallucinations. And the other thing too is I'm I am working on workflows. I'm a very visual person. So I need to see, okay. Here's where I start. It goes here, then this, and everything else. That that research that I sent where I just told you that I just put in a basic prompt into Genspark. Which is you know, agentic AI is today, if you use clauder perplexity, the easiest thing to do is you are giving an intern a task. Go get the data. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:02:19.509Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:02:20.329Z)

Go look up this. Whereas agents when you give it a task, then it has sub agents. And it says, okay, you go do this, You go do this. You get this information. You do this calculation. Comes back. It synthesizes all that data within the LLM. If there's any gaps or any other information, you can say, okay, now we've go and find this missing information.' And eventually, it the the the GPT or the the the LLM comes up with this answer. And then it gives it back to you. Right? So instead of just being an errand boy, it goes out and directs. It's like a manager and then the the employees go out and get their little things. And and that's also been extremely helpful because you're not depending on just one person person. One agent to go out and retrieve, come back because, you know yeah. I mean, it comes back with data. But unless you actually go back and look at the source and say, oh, yep. Okay. This is correct. You know, it has every opportunity to hallucinate. When you've got all these different agents, it's kinda like, you know, they're each checking each other and going back and forth.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:03:43.079Z)

Bray.

### You (2025-07-02T16:03:44.729Z)

Where we have a huge opportunity as well. And, you know, if you have a deal I can see in not too long down the line that somebody could open up InnVestAI input the basic information name, address, number of rooms, etcetera. And then they could say, hey, InnVest. Create the best deal structure, where I can get x return. I need at least blank NOI or blank ROI, blank cash on cash, you know, kind of give it the output. And then let let the agents go through and say, okay. Well, here's my data. Here's here's how it's done in the past. Here's what we can do.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:04:39.529Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T16:04:40.069Z)

Agents who then will go you know, you'd have one that'll go to the the Census Bureau website, one to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one to the county tax records to get I mean, you could have a a whole swarm of agents going out to these different areas getting the data, coming back, and then doing what it needs to do to get to your result. And that could be yep. Ten minutes or thirty minutes. That's one thing with agents. Is there it's not instantaneous. They have to go out

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:08.709Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:10.099Z)

and they consolidate, come back, review, blah blah. And they you know, I mean, sometimes, I've seen people write up research items that, you know, might take a half hour. It might take two hours. But still, if somebody can sit down into our tool and say, here's the deal. Here's here's what I need to make the numbers work. See what you can do. And Right.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:36.369Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:37.879Z)

I sat on that innovation summit that they did

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:39.899Z)

Procore, the

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:40.989Z)

but it was two weeks ago now. Yeah. And then he used the term

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:41.659Z)

I sat on that innovation summit that they did

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:44.759Z)

they're going to

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:44.869Z)

it was two weeks ago now, and they used the term they're going to democulate

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:45.629Z)

demock ritize. Each Yeah. So that their customers don't

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:49.839Z)

agents so that their customers don't

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:50.389Z)

have to do that. Right. They they

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:54.149Z)

have to do that. They and they they

### You (2025-07-02T16:05:54.569Z)

term was used. Over and over. And over and over to democratize agents democratize agents.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:05:57.759Z)

that term was used over and over and over. And then we're going to

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:01.229Z)

Yeah. And then

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:02.459Z)

agents democratize agents.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:03.099Z)

I really am focused on pro core.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:05.649Z)

And then

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:06.439Z)

As

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:07.069Z)

I really am focused on

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:07.289Z)

and once we get through at least, it's gonna be under right

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:09.029Z)

Procore as and once we get through at least getting the underwriting piece,

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:09.799Z)

piece, you know, and we're now starting to move to other other

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:13.999Z)

you know, and we're now starting to move to other

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:14.149Z)

aspects. Of the platform. Mhmm. Because hotels, if you have to get

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:16.569Z)

other aspects of the platform.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:18.729Z)

they call a product improvement

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:19.589Z)

Because hotels, you have to get something called a

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:20.519Z)

the brand, Gotcha. And then

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:23.119Z)

product improvement plan from the brand.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:23.189Z)

it it is a very long intensive manual process as well. Right? And you have and they break up

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:25.769Z)

And and and this is a very long intensive manual process.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:29.769Z)

says, okay, you've got to do do these.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:30.919Z)

As well. Right? And you and the brand comes in and says, okay. You've gotta do these.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:32.589Z)

53. Into your project scope. You have to do these

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:35.709Z)

150 things. Right? It has to get incorporated into your project scope.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:38.139Z)

things. They check all periodically. They have to check off on the end.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:40.679Z)

You have to do these things. They check off periodically.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:42.629Z)

And it's all part of the project

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:43.849Z)

They have to check off on the end.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:45.709Z)

budget. But

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:46.639Z)

And it's all part of the project

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:47.409Z)

we, in underwriting, almost every time

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:49.689Z)

budget. But we, in underwriting,

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:51.619Z)

well, multi family, maybe it's similar, hotels have to be

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:53.459Z)

almost every time well, multifamily, maybe a

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:56.069Z)

vacation every six to seven year.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:06:57.679Z)

hotels have to be renovated every six to seven years.

### You (2025-07-02T16:06:58.029Z)

Yes. Right? And so we need good recognition data, and we're kind of at

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:02.259Z)

Right? And so we need good

### You (2025-07-02T16:07:03.629Z)

point where all the renovations happened to be full.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:05.309Z)

renovation data, and we're kind of at a point where all the renovations happened to be four COVID. And now we're gonna start probably a renovation cycle

### You (2025-07-02T16:07:06.089Z)

COVID, and now we're gonna start probably a renovation cycle where the brands have been vegan and okay, we're just gonna let you go.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:14.439Z)

where the brands have been lenient and said, okay. We're just

### You (2025-07-02T16:07:14.559Z)

You know, it's been two months financially for a move on. We're gonna let you get by.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:17.729Z)

gonna let you go. You know, it's been too hard financially for everyone. We're gonna let you get by.

### You (2025-07-02T16:07:18.549Z)

A lot of people used to their FFV reserve. For debt service

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:22.459Z)

A lot of people used their

### You (2025-07-02T16:07:23.369Z)

during COVID.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:07:24.799Z)

### You (2025-07-02T16:09:36.039Z)

I think there is massive opportunity for us there too.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:09:38.869Z)

So I I think there's massive opportunity for us

### You (2025-07-02T16:09:40.059Z)

There is. There is.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:09:42.919Z)

there too.

### You (2025-07-02T16:09:43.289Z)

I did some consulting work with a company called InnVoTycoon. And and what they were is a basically, a due diligence tool. Property inspection where know, this is ten years ago and, you know, I iPads were just starting to gain and, you know, back in the day when I when I was in acquisitions, we would physically walk and

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:10:10.919Z)

Mhmm.

### You (2025-07-02T16:10:13.659Z)

inspect every apartment unit. And you have a paper. Okay. Here's the

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:10:19.279Z)

Apartment. I remember that too.

### You (2025-07-02T16:10:20.829Z)

Apartment 101, Kitchen, Czech Republic. You know, go in manually check everything. The whole carpet needs to be replaced. Well,

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:10:25.479Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T16:10:27.329Z)

basically, this was a an iPad version where you can kinda go through and check it. But they they were eventually sold. And then there's another company that was a direct competitor of theirs that really has gone much farther than than what the other ones did. And and same thing during COVID. I used to sit in some of their webinars, and they got it to the point where they have an an iPhone app where just the existing resident can go through you know, film things and and basically FaceTime and go through their and get information. And drone technology has come a long way to where you can use a drone, it'll identify areas of like, in in the roof where there's concerns and you go over all the different areas. So a lot of it can be automated these days. It doesn't mean clipboard and paper and pen and going through that. So

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:11:31.879Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:11:33.229Z)

### You (2025-07-02T16:13:04.649Z)

So and and I think one of the things that I I I need to not be involved with but one of the things I need to be updated with, I think, on a regular basis are the conversations that you and Drew have. Because we the conversation on Monday started to drift into what you and I talked about before.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:13:24.599Z)

Yeah. The

### You (2025-07-02T16:13:26.909Z)

Right? Right. You know, we need HBIS, but if for some reason,

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:13:28.009Z)

right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:13:31.569Z)

he doesn't have the ability to process this information, You know, we can't get an MVP out and have people start pushing numbers if we can't get their historical data in If we can't do that through HBIS, then you know, like we talked about, Vinod and I are gonna have to work on our own extraction process, which is going to be in a setback. So those those are have a lot of that. Make You might be talked about.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:14:01.389Z)

How did that go when you guys because you mentioned you had talked about

### You (2025-07-02T16:14:02.019Z)

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:14:06.119Z)

that with Drew. Right? I did did I catch this? Like, did how was his reaction to that?

### You (2025-07-02T16:14:06.949Z)

He I I think he's on board with it. I think he's really he sees the benefit of you know, how the two of us working together would be able to there's such a synergy between the two. You know, his clients I'm sure would be excited about InnVestAI. Our clients would be excited about getting all this aggregated data from him. Vinod and I would be excited that we don't have to build an extraction tool. Right. So so, yeah, I think, you know, he he

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:14:42.869Z)

Right.

### You (2025-07-02T16:14:44.319Z)

can can get a friend. But he's a so capital market

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:03.259Z)

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:04.439Z)

oriented and I thought that Right? And that's an incredible

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:06.859Z)

he he's so capital markets oriented that I love that. Right? And that's

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:15.209Z)

personality too. Right? But but

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:15.589Z)

there may be a lot administration stuff that kind of falls to you and I to just

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:18.889Z)

I do feel like

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:20.089Z)

have to, like, parse through. I wanna begin does that does that make

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:20.479Z)

there may be a lot of the administration stuff that kinda falls to you and I

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:23.109Z)

make sense? So so No. It makes yeah. That's exactly what I'm thinking is that

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:24.459Z)

to just have to, like, parse through in the beginning. Does that does that make sense as

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:26.359Z)

you know, I I I'm

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:19:29.519Z)

yeah.

### You (2025-07-02T16:19:29.679Z)

trusting you to handle, you know, like, the the business part of getting it set up. But I think from an actual product and development standpoint, really does kind of fall into my area of expertise as well. So I think that makes us sort of the really good team. I know I know today we jumped all over the place, got into a of the weeds, but I agree. I think if we start off with a half hour and if it goes a few minutes late, no no no big deal. But I think we can probably start getting this a little bit more organized and structured so that we don't have to just jump all around.

### Guest (2025-07-02T16:20:06.859Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-02T16:20:07.429Z)
