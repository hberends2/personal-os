### Guest (2025-08-11T21:30:47.101Z)

How are you? I'm good there. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:30:51.975Z)

Good afternoon. Happy Monday.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:30:55.741Z)

Happy Monday. I am sitting at the Milton Library. If you wonder why my surroundings look so different. I locked myself away to get through the MVP calculations.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:04.855Z)

I locked myself away to get through the calculations. And some other things.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:11.501Z)

And some other things. I'm doing. It getting through it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:14.215Z)

Get through it. You always have to. That's why I love having that. Cottage. I'm secretly hoping that it doesn't sell. Because that's what I do. I just go up there. And isolate. And get so much done.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:32.541Z)

It's so much done. At the same time.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:35.335Z)

At the same time, other people as well.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:35.821Z)

You're showing it to the other people as well.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:40.855Z)

What's that?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:43.581Z)

You guys already. You already talked about AI, right?

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:45.095Z)

Talked about. AI right?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:47.341Z)

And I know that you were feeling more comfortable with it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:47.415Z)

And I know we're feeling uncomfortable with it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:50.781Z)

I wanted to just close the loop because I'm working on the budget and the pitch deck.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:51.255Z)

I want to just close the loop because over camp budget and the pitch deck,

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:31:56.701Z)

And so I need to figure out are we need to figure out how much money we want to allocate to it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:31:57.255Z)

And so I need to figure out. We need to figure out how much mobility we want to allocate to it. And how we call it out.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:03.261Z)

And how we call it out. In the pitch deck, if that makes sense.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:06.055Z)

And that makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:08.461Z)

Because we're going to be pitching two groups that are probably technically adapt, right?

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:08.775Z)

Because we're going to be continuing to groups that are probably technically. Because they're looking at investments.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:16.381Z)

Because they're looking at investments, tech investments, all the time.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:18.375Z)

Tech investments all the time.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:20.221Z)

So how are we going to explain what we're doing and what we're using? And it probably can't be more than two pages.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:20.455Z)

So how are they going to explain. What we're doing. What we're using. And it probably can't be more than two pages. In the pitchback.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:27.101Z)

In the pitch deck. And then I need to understand.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:28.535Z)

And.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:31.741Z)

Or we need to determine a placeholder.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:33.015Z)

Determine a place for that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:32:34.141Z)

For the amount that we need to spend on resourcing.

### You (2025-08-11T21:32:35.895Z)

Amount that we need to spend. Our resources. So Vinod, to give a little bit of clarification. I had set up this call for last Friday. After, when I had brought up the question as to whether this position would be an engineer coding AI, or like a junior product manager. Who just focuses on AI. And then that's when you and I talked. And you mentioned about that you needed that third engineer. Would be a higher priority at this time. So that's kind of where we are now. So we're kind of shifting direction somewhat. That we already. You went ahead and made the offer to the engineer. But we still need to figure out the AI portion. And whether it's a junior product manager. Whether it's an engineer. I don't think it really matters at this point. I think we just need to kind of figure out when we would place.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:33:40.621Z)

A placeholder. It can pivot just so that we have something that shows that we've thought about the financial impact of it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:33:47.175Z)

Something that shows the group we thought about the financial impact of it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:33:52.141Z)

And that we can explain it succinctly in the pitch deck.

### You (2025-08-11T21:33:52.215Z)

And that we can explain it succinctly as a pitch deck.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:33:59.021Z)

So is it, like, a body that we're gonna like another body?

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:01.495Z)

Another body.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:01.981Z)

Or is it something completely other than that?

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:02.375Z)

Or is it something completely other than that?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:06.781Z)

As far as like ap, not API integrations.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:09.095Z)

API integration if the cost for certain API integrations.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:10.381Z)

It's the cost. For certain API integrations or I'm just trying to think out loud about how you actually budget for this.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:14.055Z)

Or compound. I'm just trying to think out loud about how you actually budget for this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:21.981Z)

Yeah. I mean, if we are saying that we'll hire a physical resort for AI, the product will budget it that way.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:24.375Z)

Thing with higher physical resource for AI. The brother.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:31.181Z)

Then the question would be whether you want to hire offshore or here in US.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:34.775Z)

Or getting your.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:38.781Z)

And yeah. I mean, as far as the infrastructure resources goes, yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:42.215Z)

Infrastructure, resources.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:34:43.901Z)

I. I think we'll have to put some numbers there for sure.

### You (2025-08-11T21:34:48.135Z)

And that kind of goes back to the whole. Where would this fit? If it was a product manager. It would be domestic. And it's a very high demand position right now. So I think from a budgeting standpoint, a product manager. Based in the US Would be more expensive than another offshore resource. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:35:20.461Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:35:25.895Z)

And the thing is, I think from a bandwidth standpoint, And from. Experience standpoint. I feel comfortable enough that I could do that. I don't know that we need a specialized product manager. Just for that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:35:47.181Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:35:47.655Z)

And I don't anticipate us growing to the point. Where we would need to expand the product management staff. At least in the first year or two.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:36:02.621Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:36:03.495Z)

Years ago, I probably would have not said the same thing. But with everything that we're doing with AI on the product management side, And documentation and all of the administrative aspect being so automated. Now, what used to take me a week to do, I can do in 10 minutes. I think that's why I would probably lean more Howard getting somebody on Vinod's team. That has specific maybe. I don't know if we would say a data scientist, but it certainly wouldn't hurt.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:36:34.461Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:36:40.535Z)

To look at somebody that's close to that level.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:36:48.701Z)

What have you said? I'm very comfortable and confident in that. I've seen the kind of research and product development U2, so, yeah. I think you are doing really good job. With that. You're already staying ahead of the engineering. So that is super helpful.

### You (2025-08-11T21:37:08.215Z)

Thanks.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:37:09.181Z)

Hiring. I was just going to mention.

### You (2025-08-11T21:37:13.015Z)

I think I only send it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:37:13.101Z)

I think I only sent it to Howard, but Cherry had a job posting for an AI data scientist.

### You (2025-08-11T21:37:18.295Z)

For an API. Scientist.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:37:21.341Z)

That I shot over, which looked. Just kind of looked interesting.

### You (2025-08-11T21:37:21.415Z)

That I shot over, which looked. Just kind of looked interesting.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:37:25.981Z)

Like, Is this what we need? But obviously that's a pre cheap for you guys to decide.

### You (2025-08-11T21:37:33.175Z)

It's interesting that you bring that up because what was it last week, or maybe the end of the week before, I sent Venod a link to a tool. It's been out for a little while. But I think they just came around another funding. And I'll send you the link. It's called Julius AI and it's basically. A data science tool, kind of focusing on financials. Where I thought it would be a great fit for us. Is to be able to do some of that. Financial projection. It's too predictive analytics and the things a data scientists would typically do. So I just don't know that, number one, that we'll ever get to the point where we actually need a data scientist, because I'm not sure.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:38:27.901Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:38:28.615Z)

We're doing anything that hasn't already done right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:38:32.941Z)

Like cherry does.

### You (2025-08-11T21:38:33.655Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:38:33.661Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-11T21:38:35.415Z)

But in other areas, and I don't know that we need to bring on somebody. And data science is one of those fields that AI is really taking a big bite out of because it really is all about algorithms. And analysis. And AI is really eating away at that very quickly. I hate it because five years ago it was the hottest job. In tech. One of them that's on the chopping block because of this. I'll send you that information.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:39:12.781Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:39:13.575Z)

But. I've got some good data scientists. If we wanted to have some. I've worked with quite a few. Even if it's maybe as a consultant. Or something. We could always go down that route. At first. Yeah. I just struggle justifying a full time data science, data scientist.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:39:42.621Z)

Yeah. I don't think we need a full time data scientist right now.

### You (2025-08-11T21:39:45.095Z)

I will.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:39:45.501Z)

But having an AI engineer, probably more specialized one, probably from offshore, would be a great addition.

### You (2025-08-11T21:39:45.575Z)

But having an AI engineer probably. From. Addition. I know.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:39:57.101Z)

I know if we hire someone here in us, that's going to be very expensive.

### You (2025-08-11T21:39:59.815Z)

Very expensive. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:03.421Z)

So how much should I put so one AI engineer. And what should I put for the placeholder on the cost?

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:10.055Z)

For the placeholder of the cost.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:13.581Z)

Offshore. Yeah. Probably between 35-40k, I would say. And are we aiming high, like, just so we're safe here?

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:16.135Z)

Ume to 40k, I would say. And are we high? We're safe. Here.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:22.861Z)

Or. Yeah, I think that should be good enough for a little senior engineer.

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:26.775Z)

That would be good enough.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:31.741Z)

40. 40,000? Probably, yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:34.855Z)

I've worked with many talented offshore engineers. That's not a position that I can't see why you would have to have somebody in our time zone. Right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:47.901Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:48.295Z)

That's a position that'd be very comfortable with.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:40:50.381Z)

What? And then what about. Because we're going to need to connect with so many other data sources or platforms like procore. Right? And probably Harvey and others. Do we need to put a placeholder amount for the API integration or those costs coming down so much?

### You (2025-08-11T21:40:53.975Z)

Because we're going to need to connect with so many other data sources. Pro form, right? Probably Harvey and others. Doing? Put a place integration. Or those calls coming down so much.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:41:09.341Z)

That it could be covered with a general contingency.

### You (2025-08-11T21:41:09.495Z)

That it can be covered with a general contingency.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:41:14.061Z)

Not really API implementation. But the cost of the API itself.

### You (2025-08-11T21:41:17.415Z)

API itself.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:41:18.941Z)

And that will have to do some research.

### You (2025-08-11T21:41:19.015Z)

And returns. They would sleep.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:41:22.061Z)

Which API are we going to use and how much is it going to cost us?

### You (2025-08-11T21:41:25.975Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:41:27.661Z)

In. There'll be multiple ones, won't they, Vinod? Like, because each one will have its own. Yeah. I mean, if we are using multiple platform, then yes.

### You (2025-08-11T21:41:37.655Z)

But. I know we keep saying API. I take that as just we have to connect our system to another somehow, whether it's an API, whether it's an MCP server. Which is new. Different ways of doing it. Since we don't really have anything to offer other teams. Data wise, really, at this point. I think we will be having to use the other provider's API. Which doesn't mean you're going to be managing different APIs, different endpoints, things like that. Whatever type of data we're getting from them. At some point, we'll have to offer our own API where we can start providing data to others. In which case we just have one API and we say, this is our ap. You take it, map it to your data. But the costs, they have come down significantly for APIs themselves. But like I said, it depends on who we're dealing with. Real page yardy are extremely expensive. In. Some companies do that because they don't want to share their data. If they start making their data available through other providers. It reduces their business value. So at this point, it would be a stab in the dark. To even try to come up with an estimate. I would say, as Drew talked to other providers, He might have some idea.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:43:23.101Z)

I can ask that tomorrow. When we're on our all teams call. He said the same thing, that they're expensive, but they're going down.

### You (2025-08-11T21:43:30.615Z)

Expenses, but they're going down.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:43:35.101Z)

But there's a lot of data out there.

### You (2025-08-11T21:43:35.575Z)

But there are a lot of data out there.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:43:38.941Z)

That travel click. And Nolan and I also could see a path for us where we do try to connect up through Yardi, MRI or real page so that then we can connect to Juniper Square.

### You (2025-08-11T21:43:39.495Z)

Trial click. And I also could see a path for us where we do try to connect up. We can connect to Juniper Square. I would love to be the first property type.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:43:52.781Z)

I would love to be the first property type.

### You (2025-08-11T21:43:55.415Z)

Of all the commercial asset types.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:43:55.501Z)

Of all the commercial asset types to connect data and to end, and that's a lofty goal.

### You (2025-08-11T21:43:58.455Z)

To connect data and to end and a lot of people.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:44:03.661Z)

But we're a niche. Industry, and I think we could probably do it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:44:06.375Z)

Do it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:44:07.021Z)

Before anyone else. And I think that's something that our clients on the ownership side, it would take a lot of pain.

### You (2025-08-11T21:44:10.775Z)

Something that our clients on the ownership side. Take a lot of pain out of their day to day lives.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:44:16.941Z)

Out of their day to day lives. If there was a direct connection.

### You (2025-08-11T21:44:20.135Z)

Right. So I think one of the things that benefits us is because it is a niche industry. So there IS n't the big giant out there who's controlling everything like real page and yardi. So there is probably a point, even early in the game of mutual benefits, that might help bring the cost down, at least initially. Even if it's some type of a cross sell opportunity, right? If we can introduce new clients to their products. Because typically, when you're using an API, They're not just giving you everything they've got in the database. They're going to give you the data for a specific client. I mean, that's where with real. Page and Drew even mentioned before in our call that the client has to ask the provider. To provide the data. So we have to provide them the account name, the account, their account number, I mean, all of these things, so that they know that they're going to provide us, via an API, that particular data. So if there's a cross selling opportunity, that will be very beneficial.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:45:51.741Z)

Okay? Something else that I am carrying a pretty big contingency, like 25%. Just because there's so much unknown.

### You (2025-08-11T21:45:57.495Z)

Contingency, like 25% just because there's so much money into.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:46:01.981Z)

That we're going into. Will we need anything special for. Client. What do I. I'm trying to say.

### You (2025-08-11T21:46:11.655Z)

Client implementation.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:46:11.821Z)

Client implementation. Or product support, like when things go wrong.

### You (2025-08-11T21:46:15.015Z)

When things go wrong, like a call or things like that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:46:16.701Z)

Like a call in number and things like that. Is that something that gets budgeted separately?

### You (2025-08-11T21:46:18.935Z)

Is that something? Budget separately. Well, I think, number one, we're going to have to develop a bot. Chat bot, customer service. Everybody does it now. It's super simple. That's going to fall a lot on me. Not for the chatbot itself. But we have to connect the chatbot to our internal documentation. Which means I have to compile some very thorough user guides. Step by step. Click here, do this, do that. So that'll be our first line of defense. Which would not have to include a human. At first, I would want to be the person who talks to the clients if there is an issue. There's a technical issue. I think Minod probably feels the same. So we can get a better understanding of it. Early, but at some point, I do think we're going to have some type of client service representative if there's an escalation or something else.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:47:34.781Z)

Similar to how we had in redIQ as well. We had the client service team. Suppose someone is trying to process a document? It's not processing. These guys. Training or access level, which they used to help with. So probably down the line when we have lot of clients and we'll probably need to set up that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:47:57.095Z)

Sort of thing.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:47:57.501Z)

Team down the line. Does that mean two years to you? Does that mean three years?

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:02.135Z)

Three years. 10 years, but just download. I mean.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:02.941Z)

To you. Which is down the line. Mean? Depends on how fast we grow, how many clients we have.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:09.655Z)

I would say it's going to be based on the number of clients. Not the number of.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:12.621Z)

Okay? Okay? Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:15.575Z)

Hopefully really soon.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:18.541Z)

Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:21.015Z)

Well.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:22.221Z)

Okay? And from tech side as you'll probably will need some, you know, sort of products and support team or something like that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:27.815Z)

Something like that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:32.061Z)

Who is just kind of at least one person with just fixing the production related issues.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:34.775Z)

Fixing the initial gains.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:36.621Z)

Right. Something is broken on production. Of course, the person would also work on developing the feature.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:40.295Z)

Department.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:42.541Z)

But more on the production support side. Would that be about the same cost as our three offshore engineers?

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:46.535Z)

Would that? 's part three Offshore engineers. 500.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:51.341Z)

500.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:53.415Z)

I don't believe that is what I'm going to say.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:48:53.661Z)

I don't believe that is going to be same. I think it's for now at least there are less experienced and, you know, we are just developing the mvp and I kind of, you know, requested them to show up in right now.

### You (2025-08-11T21:48:56.855Z)

For now. Less experience. We are just developing the MVP and I kind of request and control often right now probably.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:07.501Z)

And probably. They'll have better compensation.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:11.335Z)

Compensation.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:12.061Z)

And. Life balance.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:15.975Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:16.621Z)

And coming months. But yeah. I don't see. 500 is really less. But I mean, if we have some senior, that would go higher for sure. Okay? Yeah. And that actually leads into a very a good timely question, which is I was on the phone with Mark earlier today.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:30.535Z)

Question. Which is? I would call it bar soldiers.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:35.101Z)

And he's flipping out because he's going to Phoenix.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:37.335Z)

Because.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:40.301Z)

He's moderating a panel.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:40.535Z)

Moderate panel is a pretty high profile.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:41.821Z)

It's a pretty high profile.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:42.935Z)

Panel.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:43.021Z)

Panel. He put InnVestAI on his bio, but it's still not working. Put on our wait list, and so he, I mean.

### You (2025-08-11T21:49:48.935Z)

But it's still working. And so.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:49:57.501Z)

That I'm going to fix in today itself. Okay? But maybe we should talk about, like, how we do process control. Because what he was trying to tell me, and you know, I want to listen because he has done this before.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:03.015Z)

Maybe we should talk about how we do process control. Because trying to tell me listen, because.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:13.181Z)

Tried to start a prop tech before. Is that unless we get down early. How? We check if things are functioning.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:13.575Z)

Historical project before. Is that the last one? Early. Check if things are functioning.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:22.621Z)

And working, we could end up just multiplying mistakes.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:23.815Z)

We can multiply mistakes.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:28.541Z)

And so maybe not to talk about it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:30.055Z)

Maybe not to talk about it right at this moment.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:31.501Z)

Right at this moment.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:32.535Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:32.781Z)

But I think as a team, we should talk about how we put the checks in place to make sure things are working.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:35.815Z)

How it's in place to make sure things are important to those. I'm sure you guys have this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:39.661Z)

Does that make sense? I'm sure you guys had this at running. We'll have different monitoring alarms and emails coming through if something goes down. So in this case, nothing went down. I think the developers are kind of doing something with the infrastructure.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:44.615Z)

Monitoring. Coming through. Something goes down. So in this case, nothing went down. I think the developers have kind of doing something with the infrastructure.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:54.061Z)

And that changed certain things.

### You (2025-08-11T21:50:54.295Z)

And that changed certain things. But yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:50:58.701Z)

But yeah. We'll definitely have the monitoring different dashboard to track the health and the performance of the application.

### You (2025-08-11T21:51:02.135Z)

More to type performance of the application.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:51:06.061Z)

So that all will come fall in place once we go on production.

### You (2025-08-11T21:51:11.815Z)

Right now. We are just because that is incurs different cost and we don't have that in place right now.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:51:11.821Z)

Right now we are just on developing phase. Because that incurs different cost, and we don't have that in place right now. Is that what we were talking about? The production support cost? Or is that a different role?

### You (2025-08-11T21:51:20.775Z)

Talking about the production support cost. Or is that a different.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:51:26.861Z)

Production support. I was saying as a person, but these monitor that will be infrastructure cost. Is infrastructure costs okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:51:27.735Z)

I was saying as a person, but. Infrastructure cost. Infrastructure cost. Okay. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:51:40.941Z)

And should I put a certain amount in the budget for that? I think that should be included in the infrastructure. Itself. And will probably have to create production infrastructure costing separately.

### You (2025-08-11T21:51:51.015Z)

I probably have to create production costing separately. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:51:59.021Z)

Okay? Well, right now I'm just going to assume that my very big contingency will cover some things like that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:52:00.375Z)

Right now, I'm just going to assume that my very big contingency will cover some things like that. Because those are the areas that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:52:05.261Z)

Because those are the areas that. Are a little bit wild cards where we don't quite know how we're going to be spending.

### You (2025-08-11T21:52:10.455Z)

Are. We don't quite know how we're going to be spending that 20 or 25% contingency.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:52:13.101Z)

That 20 or 25% contingency.

### You (2025-08-11T21:52:17.415Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:52:19.181Z)

Can we go ahead?

### You (2025-08-11T21:52:20.935Z)

There are tools. To monitor the tools.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:52:25.501Z)

No.

### You (2025-08-11T21:52:26.055Z)

If you want to look at it that way. They're basically connected to all of the systems. We can see if there's any. Changes in how long does it take to process a document or how long does a page take to load things like that. Where if we see something that's out of the ordinary, it'll generate an alert. It doesn't wait until something goes down or something breaks. Something like the link, though sometimes. It's difficult to catch until somebody pushes the button. Right. But Vinod, that's another thing I wanted to talk about. We can take it on a different conversation, but automated qa. And what can we do? For all these things. And I'm sure you have. But I haven't even asked the question yet. Are we putting everything behind a feature flag?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:53:26.061Z)

Feature Flag is not really needed just now. But later on, once we have something developed and we want to have spaceship functionality released, Then probably we'll add that. As far as the notification go, really configure it in a way that you can get a message on a mobile. This thing is down right now.

### You (2025-08-11T21:53:42.055Z)

You can really configure it in a way that you can get a message.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:53:49.341Z)

Someone can just hop up onto that right away. But that's like a production level thing.

### You (2025-08-11T21:53:55.575Z)

That's not required for the mental state.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:53:55.661Z)

That's not required for the development or stage environment.

### You (2025-08-11T21:53:58.135Z)

Environment. Okay? Let's. The next time you talk, let me take a few minutes to go over the pricing. Research that I did because there will be a need for feature flags.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:07.341Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:11.655Z)

Down the road. So we can talk about that. Later.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:17.261Z)

Piece of leg is really cool level things, so we don't need anything.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:18.455Z)

Things separate.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:20.381Z)

Separate for that. And on our call tomorrow.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:24.535Z)

Tomorrow. At 5:30 is where I just wanted to be dogs with. This is what happened with the website.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:25.261Z)

At 5:30. Is it all right if we lead off with this? Just say this is what happened with the website, this is what happened with Dell and aws.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:30.695Z)

This is what happened. Aws.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:33.821Z)

And this is how we plan to be very just set off the checks and balances on our work. Just so that Mark feels better about that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:41.975Z)

Feels better. About this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:43.341Z)

Because he's trying to entice.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:43.495Z)

Because he's trying to entice. This longstanding friend.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:47.741Z)

This long standing friend and a friend, but a competitor in some ways to Mark, right?

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:51.095Z)

And affirming a competitor in some ways to work right. It's kind of like he has this friendly rivalry.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:54:55.501Z)

It's kind of like he and Mark have this friendly rivalry is maybe the best way to put it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:54:58.935Z)

Is maybe the best way to put it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:55:01.341Z)

And Mark's like, diane, if dancies that website didn't work.

### You (2025-08-11T21:55:04.215Z)

That website.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:55:06.221Z)

It's like we're going to lose our credibility.

### You (2025-08-11T21:55:08.855Z)

And so if we could just kind of lead off.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:55:09.101Z)

And so if you guys. If we could just kind of lead off and, like, this is what happened.

### You (2025-08-11T21:55:12.215Z)

This is what happened. We know.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:55:13.741Z)

We know it was a glitch. We've done this successfully at red iq, and this is how we did it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:55:16.455Z)

We feel it successfully. This is how we did it. Just so that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:55:20.141Z)

Just that. So that. I'm not delivering anything foolproof right now. We are just getting started. We are on development phase. This website just went live back or something. That time it was fine. I didn't think when we spent any time testing it. But if the website is so critical now, we'll pay special attention to it. We'll put checks and balances in place. Right. Because I literally just had a kind of test pages page running on God id, and nobody felt it was important.

### You (2025-08-11T21:55:59.735Z)

And nobody felt it was important.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:01.581Z)

So now we feel it is very important.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:03.575Z)

And very important.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:03.741Z)

Then we'll be very important attention to it. We'll put the test cases notification and monitoring everything around it. We can do all that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:13.975Z)

I appreciate that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:14.221Z)

I appreciate that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:14.775Z)

And what has changed is that we're picking up our conversations with, like, industry friends and stuff like that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:15.021Z)

And what has changed is that we're picking up our conversations with industry friends and stuff like that.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:20.295Z)

And so that is the difference between a month or two months ago.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:22.381Z)

That is the difference between a month or two months ago. When we were still earlier in the process, right? Yeah. You guys can make this clear. Earlier. Than probably we can avoid situations like this.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:35.095Z)

Like this.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:36.461Z)

Okay? Just right or not. We kind of going to demo. Don't touch this environment. Don't touch this feature.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:44.615Z)

Environment. Don't touch this feature.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:47.741Z)

And that kind of thing. So we'll just make sure we are not.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:51.975Z)

We are not playing around, okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:52.541Z)

Playing around with anything. Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:56.535Z)

And whenever you're ready, Drew and myself.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:56.701Z)

And whenever you're ready, Drew and myself.

### You (2025-08-11T21:56:59.015Z)

That I don't know that market is going to be doing the same level.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:56:59.581Z)

I don't know that Mark is going to be doing the same level of testing that Drew and I will be doing.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:01.255Z)

Of testing that through, and I will be doing.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:04.701Z)

That we're ready to start testing.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:06.135Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:06.301Z)

So just when it's ready to start to roll out.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:06.455Z)

I just wanted to start to roll out. We are ready to underwrite.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:08.861Z)

We are. Ready. To underwrite.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:13.175Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:13.581Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:13.895Z)

I'm going to let you know I push to your environment.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:13.981Z)

I'm going to let you know whenever I push to your environment, which is a staging environment right now.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:19.255Z)

Right now. We are amazing.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:20.221Z)

We are kind of making and breaking dev environment a lot of times.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:21.575Z)

And breaking the environment.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:25.341Z)

There's a lot of progress. But yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:27.175Z)

As soon as I have something solid.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:27.341Z)

As soon as I have something solid on this staging environment, I'll shoot an email to you guys.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:29.335Z)

On this rising environment. I'll show an email, guys. But I have a result that I have not pushed anything because there's nothing stable on the environment right now.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:34.301Z)

But ever since I said that I have not pushed anything because there's nothing stable on dev environment right now. Continuously delping, but I think, yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:43.495Z)

But.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:46.621Z)

Well, I'll try to push something. A stage.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:46.935Z)

I'll try to push something on stage. Thank you.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:50.621Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:52.775Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:53.261Z)

Okay? I think that's it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:53.815Z)

That's it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:54.701Z)

And Drew did, he is going to push the operating agreement. Over to me since I have more time this week.

### You (2025-08-11T21:57:57.095Z)

Over to me since I have more time this week. So.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:57:59.741Z)

So I hope we'll make. Maybe we can get a jump by Friday. I mean, that's a possibility.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:04.855Z)

That's a possibility. I don't know if we have an attorney look at it.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:06.621Z)

I don't know if we. If we need to have an attorney look at it.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:09.095Z)

But maybe we get a collective Friday.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:09.661Z)

But maybe we get it ready by Friday for an attorney until look at. But I'm going to make progress on it this week.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:11.975Z)

For an attorney to look at progress on it this week. Very good.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:18.701Z)

Sounds great.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:19.895Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:20.381Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:20.615Z)

Thank you.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:21.101Z)

Thank you, guys.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:21.255Z)

Guys. Have a good night.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:21.901Z)

Have a good night.

### You (2025-08-11T21:58:22.455Z)

Okay? See you.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:58:24.621Z)

Okay? Bye. All right.
