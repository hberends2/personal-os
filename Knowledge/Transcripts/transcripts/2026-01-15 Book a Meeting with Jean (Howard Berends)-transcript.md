# Transcript for: Book a Meeting with Jean (Howard Berends)

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:31:06.764Z)

Good morning. Doing great. And you. You and michigan. Right.

### You (2026-01-15T18:31:20.750Z)

Yes. Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:31:24.124Z)

What part of Michigan?

### You (2026-01-15T18:31:29.310Z)

On lake michigan. I grew up on the lake. In grand weapons. Actually, we're just north of Grand Rapids. So right there. Straight across the way from Milwaukee, north of Chicago.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:31:50.444Z)

I've been to Milwaukee. Few times. I had a customer a long time ago. I think it was Northwestern Mutual, something like that. I spent some time in several times. Yeah. I used to also have a customer in Chicago. And the date starting release, knowing and freezing. I said, yeah, you are not going to see me before the next spring.

### You (2026-01-15T18:32:29.310Z)

Yeah. Chicago community. Cold.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:32:33.004Z)

Oh. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-15T18:32:33.550Z)

Time especially. It's called the Red City for a reason. It's just flat. To the west. And that's kind of the prevailing winds, even here. But the way this should actually tends to warm up the air. It doesn't cool off as quickly warmer than what they are. Plus. Nothing blocking the wind there, so it's nasty. So anyway. Going well.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:33:16.524Z)

Yeah. Great. And complain about the weather here at least.

### You (2026-01-15T18:33:21.630Z)

Yeah, that's true. That it doesn't change. It exists. Perfect every day.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:33:31.004Z)

Not perfect every day, but it's never really super warm. Or hot. It's never called.

### You (2026-01-15T18:33:39.390Z)

Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:33:40.924Z)

We only have two season. Ing and somewhere. But even the summer is relatively I'm close to the ocean, so.

### You (2026-01-15T18:33:49.790Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:33:53.084Z)

Hot that it can be. Inland. But, yeah, everything good and. Working with Michael Founders on defining the tech stack and trying to balance between what we want to do for the mvp, what makes sense. It's read the definition of trying to define how deep we should go into the tech stack and the foundation for the MVP and balance between. We want to have something quite stable, of course, but we want to go fast as well, and we want to get in front of our customer as soon as possible. With a working solution. And trying to find the right balance here. Ingenious tend to at least some engineers tends to. Want to do something not perfect, but rebuild perfect for the strong foundation. And so that's what we are trying to balance between. Ok. In the context of AI development now. We're also learning that Mayberg, really there are things that we have to do differently than what we do we would have done. Maybe a year ago. Because it goes so fast with AI and you can afford to make this or you can make different different decision and say that, okay?

### You (2026-01-15T18:35:24.030Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:35:31.804Z)

We're going to do. We're going to go fast, but we're going to. We know we're going to trash it. It's more like we want to get something. Where we can have feedback because all what we are doing here, it's still a bit new. That's the one of the challenge is not like we are trying to do the same thing as anyone else and say, okay, now we're going to do that. Better. It's better than Excel, but. It's going to require some to work on how to maximize adoption for property manager and what are the features that might resonate the most? This is why it's exciting as well. I found that we are trying to build something really new that does not exist on the market. While solving an existing problem.

### You (2026-01-15T18:36:26.110Z)

Y. Eah. That's it. So I guess. I still drew back to quite a bit of questions that I had. As well as yours. So I guess I'm very interested in helping out with this. I guess. What is your plan? What would we do? From here.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:36:51.084Z)

I don't have. I don't have a reset plan. Reason is. I want to make sure that I find the right person. And then every people that I meet have different kind of profile. And I see that. I'm trying to define a role at the same time. What I know for sure is what I told you is I don't want to be alone on the product. So I have my engineers, the node. They know the technology, understand the business. They have a very strong background. In building financial platform so that they understand all the concept. Have someone who is replaying an advisory role who is a retired Treasury Manager like 30 years Treasury Manager for real estate company. So he's bringing is not going to be the guy hands on on the day to day like full time. But yeah, he's he's available when we need his invest, and I want to bring someone who can be. A good, good complementarity with me, with what I know, with what I don't know, with what I like to do. And so it's refining the right person here. And it's very different from every other kind of other research that I've done before. When you look for someone, a profile where. You have a specific job description for a company that has already. Stable company, I would say here. It's kind of finding someone who's going to be an expert, a friend, a co founder. Like, it's a mix of reasons, especially at the beginning. All the other people that are bringing is people that I know that I trust, and I want to. And I want to bring someone else who's going to be. The right fit in the combination. This kind of adventure. When you start, if you have 1% that is not the right person for whatever reason, when you're four, it's 25% of the team. Is not a good fit. It can all take us down. So that's why. Please appreciate the fact that I'm not very set because I'm want to keep things super open for now. And continue conversation with very few people. And then I want also very one of the step would be for you to meet soon with one of my co founders. Also to have a different prospective. I think that the recipe has to work on both side. As long as you can. Bring passion in what you do. And you are on board with the vision. I think that's really a first good step. The rest why it's not like the other people that I know have been working with for other professional life. So I experience that person that I'm trying to bring now. I didn't find that person in my network, at least a person that was available. Or a person that I thought that would be ready for this kind of adventure because it's very different when you go on. Early stage adventure. Than when you are in a stable company. Yeah, there are people I found that could be a good feat. But when started discussing I realized that there is a form of chaos at the beginning and you need to be comfortable with living in some chaos. Chaos means more like unknown uncertainty of things where why we just don't. Know, we don't have an answer, and we have to accept that we don't know. And we. Sometime we. We want to prototype, and it's, it's a. It's a risk that we measure and say, okay, let's try to do that without being sure, but it's, It's. A risk. Most ideally, most of the time, we want to test the ideas with customers or our people. So it's going to be. That's why for me, it's critical to have MVP something that is running so that we get feedback from. We have something tangible. Show to a property manager, a finance team and get feedback. Because all the discussion I had so far is. It's. It's very theoretical. It's, oh, yeah, I have that problem. And then if you were to have that, then it could solve that. It would solve my problem or, yes. I could. I could imagine that I can pay for that solution. But there is always a difference between, yeah, it's good, it looks good, and yeah, I'm going to pay for it.

### You (2026-01-15T18:42:15.310Z)

No checkbook. That all makes sense. And I think we touched on that before. Really? Today. I just wanted to check in, find out. What is the status? Do you want me to move forward and meet with those people? Do you still want some time? What? Do you want to do?

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:42:44.124Z)

A couple of things. Based on what we've discussed so far, what is. Your understanding or how do you picture the problem that we are trying to solve and the way we solve it? How do you see what's the big picture they have in mind now?

### You (2026-01-15T18:43:07.150Z)

I think it really does come. Go back to the first couple of conversations where I I. Do feel that. What we're looking to accomplish here is, like you said, you want to forecast cash flow. I would. I would think that our target client. Then would be the controllers. Of a larger organization. Maybe the cfo, the smaller size organization. But how do we go about that? In a multifamily environment. Is a lot of. Variables, you know, fixed costs. Yeah, there's some generous amount of fixed costs in there, but. With multifamily and any commercial real estate. Even they have move ins, you can have move outs, you can have skips, you're going to have lease rewards. You need to know what has your historical. Trends. When and how do they project forward? There's a lot of things that go in there, other than how many people are living there today. Right. So if you're. If you're looking to forecast the next 30 days, It's fairly straightforward. But if you're looking forward. Look, forecast anything out beyond that. There's an awful lot of trends that you have to take into consideration. Seasonality. All of the different things. That's my understanding. And where I would be able to contribute would be. The work that I've done. In the past with. With the rolling forecast and everything else, which really is very similar to what we've done here. But like I said, everything was in Excel. Right. So I think. Ultimately. It is to be able to have a tool that would give you near real time. Information. You know, based on. When was that information last updated from the site? Is it nightly? Is it weekly? Whatever. But to do it. Not. Having to go through any type of a copy paste on the road, getting information from multiple sources. And. Manually putting it all together. To project your cash flow, which is essentially what the majority of them are doing. Today. Is that something like. I've got to.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:45:45.644Z)

Yeah. Your experience is saying that building a hauling forecast was one of the very first experience back in. 2010 something.

### You (2026-01-15T18:46:01.790Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't my first experience, but it's where I was with the partners. That was pretty much my. Work with John Tomlinson, who was the CFO just recently retired. And my job was to basically work on the budgeting, but as part of the budgeting, I push back. On only working on annual budgets because they sounded very early. In the season. They would start their budgeting process in June or July. And. You know? My argument. I think I mentioned before is nobody's got a crystal ball. That's going to look 18 notes 18 months out. So if I'm in june of 2025, And I have to project all the way through December of 2026. You just taking a wild guess at what's going to go on there? So I started to implement the rolling forecast. And we had a new technical team, and even though it was based in Excel, we were able to. Extract a lot of data. Directly into the model. From the reality system. But it was not automated. We still had to trigger it. We still had to export a report. In a CSV and load that into the model. I'm very filled with. Visual basic vba coding. And macros, and so I was able to automate a large portion of it. Never. Nearly would have wanted to. But even then. It was a far cry from John being able to sit in his computer and pull up a screen that shows all this information. It was still the Excel. So the process, I think, of what I did there. Would be directly applicable to what we're trying to do here. Again, just putting it out of getting it out of the Excel environment and keeping it know, a web based app.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:48:25.324Z)

And Ben partner was. Was a property manager. Or what was that?

### You (2026-01-15T18:48:34.270Z)

Definitely the top 50. When I was there were probably. Almost cracking the top 10 owners and managers, they only manage their own portfolio.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:48:50.524Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-15T18:48:51.470Z)

They're very large. And prior to that. Asset Management, FBA Management services. They were both older and third. Party manager. There. I have a portfolio of about 25,000 units. And they've grown substantially since then. They're also definitely top 50. I was in stance with error as the SF manager for nudging as well, but that was before I started to get involved in the roding forecast. But, yeah, I've always kind of been in that budgeting and forecasting role.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:49:33.804Z)

Sorry. I'm just opening to talk to my. You. Do you still have access to. You talk about the. The CFO at Bell Partners?

### You (2026-01-15T18:49:46.750Z)

Yeah, I still have access to them. And I think you're doing really good. Resource. For us.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:49:52.844Z)

Yeah, I'm not speaking about Jean, but more like. If this is someone even at this stage, you can for you to make up your mind and, and test the idea of okay, what if you were to have a solution that does this? Four things, which is, number one, daily cash position and bank reconciliation. Real time. Second thing is all the forecasting and, and all the liquidity. Risk. Payment. Enforce is. Its optimization of you walking. You're working capital like being able to automatically invest in highly interest account and having user services to optimize your cash flow. So question would be okay, if you were to have a solution that automates everything that connects to Jali, Is it something that. Is it something that solving a problem for for you?

### You (2026-01-15T18:51:04.910Z)

Left.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:51:05.084Z)

And transmission. We will. Even before talking about that is what is your biggest pain when it comes to managing your cash flow.

### You (2026-01-15T18:51:17.470Z)

Being very comfortable to reach out to him and have a conversation. And so that's a good idea. I'm not sure what I haven't done already.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:51:25.324Z)

That's what I mean. It's also for you to make up, to help you to better understand. While the opportunity. Because I've done that with property manager. Of course, the more debater. But that could be an interesting point for you to. To assess the opportunity. What's your expectation in term of. First role and then compensation. Globally speaking and timeline.

### You (2026-01-15T18:52:07.630Z)

In terms of the world, I think we're both clear on that. I mean, obviously, the product management side. And I think. You made a good point. You considered it to be your right hand person on just the day to day. Product management role. But also the fact that I've done zero to one in the past. I'm very comfortable. With the ambiguity. To do so. Need to keep my ears and eyes open to make sure that we're all alone. I can work with the dog team, work with the clients. Trying to get together that mvp. So for the know, I'm not really concerned about the day to day responsibilities. Timeline. I can start. Anytime that you guys are ready to put the. Pen to paper. And get all this scrolling. Compensation. I haven't really thought about exactly what it would take. I am open to. Pretty much any type of compensation. Whether. It's straight, solid, whether it's salary plus equity, whether there's something. Limited on sweat equity involved. At the very beginning. That's. The situation that I had with the hotel valuation model. But I can't go without inc. Ome for very long, so I would hope to have some type of an income, even if it's. Enough to pay the bills, but that's the thing that I haven't. Really? Come up with a plan yet or an idea, because at this point in the start that there's so many options. So I'm just to find out what you have in mind and we can work something out.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:54:00.444Z)

Yeah. My so. My objective is. And that's ideal because. Yeah, you never know when you start raising fund. Can go fast, can take forever, and then maybe you eat the ball, and then you realize, okay. It was not the. The idea was not good, or we are not solving the problem the way. But at the end, bottom line, it's. It's a dead end. And then we stop. But. I would expect that we. We can build an MVP within one month to two months. Now, I. I've shortened that because we are taking different assumption now to go faster and then really accepting that we're going to trash stuff. Because we can re. Build very fast as well, and the priority remains. Let's get. Let's put that in front of customers.

### You (2026-01-15T18:55:17.310Z)

Go.

### Guest (2026-01-15T18:55:18.844Z)

So let's say one to two months, 2 billion BP. We're going to start put a stick in the ground February 1st. End of March and a free pre legulators. We have something now. Maybe one month, two months. So it's between, let's say those time unit start and the time we. We have feedback and. And we are ready to go for fundraising. It's between anything between two to four months. Then going after a seed round. It can go fast. It can take one month. It can take three months. If it's more than three months. I guess. It's probably because no one wants to invest in this ide and this in the team. So we have the. We have the wrong recipe. I'm just trying to consider all the. All the options, but, yeah. There is money on the market now. So we're going to all work with equity until we raise capital. And be transparent. Some are my co founders, some they have a job. So it's a part time, they're going to work on the project or they work on the project after work during the weekend. So I'm going to be. I'm full time, so I can. I can wait for next. I can afford to wait for three to four months just focusing on that. But once we raise fund. I don't want to go too cheap. For different reason. One is because I want to make sure that everyone gets a fair compensation. I don't want everyone that. Everyone gets health paid. And then why? Because everyone has to be focused on the project, on building the company the platform, and the company not having to think about how I'm going to pay my bill. So that's one thing. And yeah, I think it's normal that if we won't get the market compensation, that's going to be. It's not going to be on top of the market, but composition where. You can leave this decent life. And equity, of course. And so there will be equity that will be for the time between restart and we raise. And then, of course, then we still have equity after that. Because I want, I think it has to be fair and everyone has to be. Has to feel that they have. Well, they have not to feed, but they have skill in the game and that creates an opportunity. We are not really thinking about exit in term of timeline. But we are all in all, let's say mid fifth, mid-40s to mid-50s. And we've we have several experience before like you. And then we. We don't think it's going to be an adventure for the next 20 years. But we never know. Yeah. When you start, finally, things can be, like, crazy, fun and exciting, and then you keep working. Day is night without. Without limitation. But, yeah, fair. Play of fair assessment, as of now, of everyone expectation would be, okay, let's. Let's at least do that for five years. If we can pass the first year and then see that there is, there is. A we, we understand our market and then there is growth, then at least let's do that for five years. And in five years. If we have, if we are successful, we're going to find some. This there's someone who's going to buy the company and we'll see at that time. So it's more is try to put some, some perspective even if it, it might completely change. And yeah. As the company grow and we are successful, we keep adjusting the rewards for everyone so that we are focusing on what excite us to grow the company and we can grow our family. That's one thing. The other thing is I don't want to spend my time trying to raise fund. It's very time consuming. It's painful. The most exciting. So that's why I want to raise a seed that is a good size. So that we have a Runway. For maybe 18 months would be great. And if we pass the 18 months where we should be on a good. On a good path. So that. That's really my mindset here. I don't want anyone to feel squeezed. And anyone. Everyone should be. Super excited and focus on. On. On building the company. And not having to be stressed about paying W.

### You (2026-01-15T19:01:31.390Z)

Up. Yeah, that's perfectly reasonable. I think the timeline is good. I don't think it's overly aggressive, unreasonable. I think it seems fairly aligning. You keep that down this road before as well.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:01:45.324Z)

Ow.

### You (2026-01-15T19:01:50.590Z)

Yeah, that was definitely one of the frustrations with the hotel valuation. Nobody on that founding team. Had any experience. They came from the industry but had not experienced startups. That would motivate rough, but yeah, this one sounds. Like the same situation here.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:02:13.804Z)

It's pretty the other way around here because we are not coming from the industry in the sense none of us quite except our. Advisor, but none of us have been a treasurer for property management for 10 years. Like where you know the business in and out, but we have experience in building technology. For 25 plus years and working different kind of, different size of company. So that's what we bring on the table.

### You (2026-01-15T19:02:47.550Z)

All right. Hey, that sounds good. Let me also after the song also joined to my calendar as well. So I know I've been setting up timeline, your calendar, but I think it should be the other way. Around. So I think the next step sounds like it will be in your port. To decide what the next step is. Might be when we get together and speak again. I know you said you're talking to others. Whenever. You're ready to move forward, you can go ahead and grab some time. Does that sound reasonable?

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:03:28.284Z)

Next step. Pray for next week. I will send an email to 1, at least 1 of my co founders so you can have a chat. In the meantime, if you can, try to reach out to people you've been working with as cfo. What's the name? People will work any any kind of financial capacity for property management company. And test the idea on your. On your end. And see you. Can. I don't know. I'm just. If you. If you. If you can do that, and it's easy.

### You (2026-01-15T19:04:16.670Z)

No. Absolutely. It's a great idea. I'd be more than happy to do that.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:04:28.764Z)

Okay, sounds good. Well, great to chat with you today. We have. We have the next step. And in the meantime, feel free to reach out if you have any.

### You (2026-01-15T19:04:40.110Z)

Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'll certainly, at a minimum, single summary in our conversation. When I do speak to them. And there's a couple other people that I have in mind as well. So maybe I'll be able to get two or three conversations in before the next time we touch base.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:04:59.084Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-15T19:04:59.470Z)

Ball sounds good. All right.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:05:02.844Z)

Right. Thanks a while.

### You (2026-01-15T19:05:04.430Z)

Thanks. Take care.

### Guest (2026-01-15T19:05:06.284Z)

You too. Bye. Bye.
