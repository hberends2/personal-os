Right? So those are the, you know, in our like, in Hotel BIS, we had it sort of broken out into, like, you'll there's, like, operating departments. Undistributed departments, and then the last one being nonoperating. Right? So so GOP gross operating profit is everything that we just talked about, the operating departments and undistributed, you know, revenues minus expenses equals GOP. And then below that, you have management fees.

Which are paid to the hotel operator. Usually, like, two or 3% of revenue. And then below that, you'd have all your nonoperating items. So, like, any, like, lease income, if you, like, leased out space on your roof, for an antenna

Through each of those items, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:34.858Z)

And then they'll have, you know, subsequent detail

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:34.881Z)

rim. Details for

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:37.878Z)

pages for each of those items, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:39.711Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:40.228Z)

detailed rooms,

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:40.751Z)

So you.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:42.878Z)

details for f and b, etcetera.

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:43.221Z)

They they have So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:45.868Z)

So or at least they, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:47.971Z)

thing.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:49.148Z)

they they have those things

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:50.991Z)

Typically,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:51.028Z)

whether whether or not they provide that as a separate separate story. Right? So

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:53.001Z)

Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:56.488Z)

just to go into some of these

### You (2025-05-09T16:40:58.441Z)

different types of hotel operators.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:40:58.988Z)

Right? Like, and also just to go, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:03.521Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:04.438Z)

different types of hotel operators. Right? Like, the operators are the ones that produce the financial statements.

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:07.591Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:09.418Z)

Right? And so in this case, like, this is a courtyard operated by a company called McKibben.

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:10.241Z)

By Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:13.638Z)

Right? Courtyard is a Marriott brand. It's franchise. Right? So McKibben is the operator.

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:14.771Z)

Right? One day area. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:18.498Z)

Is part of also part of Marriott. But in this case, it's operated

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:19.621Z)

You know, too. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:23.468Z)

by Marriott. Right? So it's know, you and you could have courtyards operated by Marriotts too. Right?

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:28.611Z)

Right? So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:29.278Z)

It's a bit different. And then Weston, similarly, is a

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:30.091Z)

the operator operators

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:31.698Z)

is a Marriott brand, but this was operated by Davidson. Right? So the operators are really the operators are the ones if they're operating the hotel, they're the ones that are gonna produce an statements. They're where we're get we get all of the data.

### You (2025-05-09T16:41:41.991Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:41:44.068Z)

Right, for for the most part. So that's the comp that company is going to dictate what the financial statement looks like and where and what system it's coming from. And SH group is is, is one that's actually that's, independent. Operated independent brand in operation. So I'll show you the Marriott one first, actually, because this is, like, a sort of very they're they're very cookie cutter, very standard. So

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:22.891Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:28.458Z)

So

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:29.011Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:33.018Z)

is a Marriott P and L. Right? As I you know, do you have actuals budget last year for month to date and then year to date?

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:38.061Z)

It you know, cold. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:40.428Z)

Right? And so it's not exactly the way that it was, but it's close to got rooms. Then food and beverage total

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:47.651Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:48.908Z)

other operated total,

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:49.611Z)

yeah. The the pressure yeah. The the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:51.628Z)

and then miscellaneous.

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:52.231Z)

that's it.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:53.258Z)

Right? So and they they this the the restaurant audio visual banquet, that just

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:56.971Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:58.818Z)

adds up.

### You (2025-05-09T16:42:59.281Z)

Expect this issue.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:42:59.378Z)

To what's in food and beverage.

### You (2025-05-09T16:43:00.131Z)

Profit. For the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:43:03.318Z)

Right? And then you have they actually instead of showing expenses, they show profit. For the operating departments. Then they show undistributed. And, again, management fees in this particular tab, they break out the nonoperating. Like, that is not broken out here.

### You (2025-05-09T16:43:19.831Z)

So it's

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:43:22.368Z)

And then they have the replacement for reserve, and then the stats are down here.

### You (2025-05-09T16:43:22.861Z)

again, they have

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:43:26.448Z)

So this is a again, Marriott PNL. They have ones that have more detail as well.

### You (2025-05-09T16:43:34.061Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:43:37.608Z)

Like, Okay. So this and this is a Marriott PNL that has a summary tab,

### You (2025-05-09T16:44:06.521Z)

dealership.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:44:07.038Z)

Right? Same summary tab.

### You (2025-05-09T16:44:07.971Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:44:08.778Z)

This is the oh, they call it the owner version of the summary tab. Just

### You (2025-05-09T16:44:14.291Z)

So like, for

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:44:15.388Z)

and then they have, like, a d a tab for each of the departments. Right? So, like, one for, you know, rooms, food and beverage center. So in in so the the numbers below. Right? Zero zero one zero. Are these room based, revenues? What is this? These numbers here? Yeah. Those are department codes. Department code. Okay. Yeah. And then this is in a different format because this is coming from a different system.

### You (2025-05-09T16:44:46.511Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:44:47.608Z)

Right. Let's let's let's get getting at. Like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:44:50.621Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:44:50.628Z)

every hotel operator is gonna have a different format. Right? So we current we currently have know, 40 or 50 different operators that we deal with. And across those operators, there's maybe, like, 20 or 30 different systems and they all produce PNLs in different ways. And even within, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:10.161Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:10.218Z)

even within the same like, Profit Sort is one of those systems that Diane mentioned a lot.

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:15.931Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:16.588Z)

Like, Profit Sort can produce p n P and Ls

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:17.441Z)

like, I'll share

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:19.178Z)

for each different operator that look different.

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:21.311Z)

So, Vinod, I think what we need to do

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:22.618Z)

So like like, I'll show you the

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:25.161Z)

and what I've been starting to work on is we'll have to, at the time that we onboard these clients, just like we do at Red IQ, Matt their operating statements to the Red IQ master, We will create

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:37.828Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:38.291Z)

basically, what we see here, the summary where where Drew says they're all basically the same format. We'll call that the invest master chart of accounts. Right? So everything is mapped to the same one.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:53.568Z)

Mhmm. So

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:55.841Z)

We let's say,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:56.628Z)

real quick, Howard. So

### You (2025-05-09T16:45:57.931Z)

new act

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:45:59.068Z)

if we think about the life cycle of a deal, right, let's say this is a a new acquisition that somebody, you know, they they're go to the broker. They they sign the NDA. They get the the data from the data room. The data room data room is gonna have these p and l's, And

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:17.071Z)

Right. Get that data

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:20.528Z)

yeah, they're all gonna look different. So we, you know, we we don't

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:21.831Z)

But I would probably a contract.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:25.238Z)

ingest data from the p and l like that.

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:26.241Z)

Then destruction data

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:28.208Z)

As the deal moves forward and eventually it gets to a certain point, like, probably under contract,

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:28.981Z)

that if going to our system, and to increase the the bone

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:32.488Z)

then they'll be able to get the structured data

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:34.641Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:35.618Z)

that can flow into our system to to be produced to to run through our system, standardize everything, and get it into into Invest. And I and after an acquisition close, I mean, ideally, we want to keep

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:46.271Z)

You know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:46.668Z)

the customer using the product. Right? Like, we wanna

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:48.541Z)

the system to do here.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:49.418Z)

wanna be like, okay. Well, you did it for your underwriting. Your performance in there.

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:49.901Z)

Evaluation update.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:52.778Z)

You know? Keep running the data through the system to do your quarterly valuation updates.

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:54.671Z)

To monitor the the investment mix.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:57.298Z)

To do refinancings,

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:59.001Z)

Up.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:46:59.188Z)

right, like, to continue to monitor the the investment that you've made until you get rid

### You (2025-05-09T16:46:59.251Z)

Right? Like that.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:04.138Z)

till you sell it. Right? So and and throughout the life cycle, like, that the ownership part of the life cycle,

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:10.251Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:11.298Z)

the data can run through a hotel BIS. Right? So that that's easy because we already do that. The the the challenge is this early on part. Right? When it's you know, it's it's doing your preliminary underwriting, and all you have access to is these summary P and Ls.

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:26.371Z)

Going family.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:28.638Z)

And and right now, the way it works is somebody is going in and manually typing this stuff in. Right? Like, an analyst is going and typing into Excel. This is not coming from a system. This is, like, manually created.

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:40.781Z)

For somebody to do

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:41.618Z)

No. No. No. This is coming from a system.

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:42.211Z)

under the Excel.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:44.098Z)

I'm saying, like, the process right now that

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:45.091Z)

An out from the data room from the Calabrio broker data room.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:47.158Z)

for somebody to do underwriting in Excel

### You (2025-05-09T16:47:48.961Z)

They're downloading the edit and copy and paste thing or manual timing it.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:47:50.078Z)

they're they're getting these p and l's from the data room from, like, a, you know, a broker data room. They're downloading them, and then they're copy and pasting or manually typing in Mhmm. Got it. The key the key

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:01.301Z)

And that's why I'm assuming. Right? So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:01.538Z)

know, data points. Right? Like, rooms available, rooms sold, revenue by year. Right? So that's

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:07.131Z)

You said there

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:07.968Z)

and that's time consuming. Right? So Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:08.741Z)

twenty four twenty three actual systems where

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:10.318Z)

Going back to what you were saying earlier, Drew. So you said there are twenty three twenty two, 23 types of systems. Well,

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:16.541Z)

Yeah. I have this.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:17.838Z)

this data can flow from.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:19.501Z)

More there's

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:19.708Z)

I mean, there's there's

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:20.961Z)

And the shareholder

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:21.648Z)

more than that. There's hundreds.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:22.781Z)

like, this one profit here.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:23.058Z)

Differences. I think there's twenty twenty or 30 that we deal with.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:25.611Z)

And it's for operator

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:25.968Z)

Okay. And the challenge is that

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:27.671Z)

but at David,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:29.118Z)

like, this one comes from Profit Sword.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:30.061Z)

set it up. Way. Mhmm. And

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:31.888Z)

And it's for operator Davidson.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:33.311Z)

no one else could have

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:34.028Z)

But

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:34.641Z)

This one is very

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:35.218Z)

that Davidson set it up to look a certain way.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:36.001Z)

similar.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:38.148Z)

Mhmm. And no one else is gonna have like, this one is very similar to what I showed you in the use, Sally. Book. Right? It's got avail you know, your your staff up here, four categories for for revenues. For expenses, undistributed expenses. It it's very much like NewSal.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:54.281Z)

What read. It Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:57.808Z)

So this this is a great example.

### You (2025-05-09T16:48:59.551Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:48:59.628Z)

Of, like, one that would be, I think, easier to read Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One's by month. Versus versus, like, you know, month to date, year to date. And that's the one you showed earlier, that was probably the most complex. Right? I mean, yeah, in a way.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:16.931Z)

The So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:19.258Z)

The thing is, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:20.511Z)

Which but no. That's that's what we're used to.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:21.938Z)

they're all gonna be different.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:23.281Z)

Right? That's right. Right. Right. That's why we're just mapping. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:23.848Z)

So and Right. Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:26.951Z)

Yeah. So that your service system on the one service Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:31.408Z)

Right.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:32.881Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:33.228Z)

Yeah. So the use salary system, the one you the document you earlier, So it was basically explaining how the

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:40.661Z)

Right? Thinking from

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:44.728Z)

information in the document flows.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:45.751Z)

from what

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:47.008Z)

Right? There there's some write up this write up. Right? I'm just

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:47.061Z)

perspective of machine learning.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:50.808Z)

the from the perspective of machine learning.

### You (2025-05-09T16:49:53.061Z)

We have something you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:49:55.288Z)

That if we could feed this information, then probably we'll have something you know, basically, our system might

### You (2025-05-09T16:50:04.661Z)

Yeah. And and and, Drew, I think what we're looking to do

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:50:05.328Z)

get ready if, you know, we are able to feed it different

### You (2025-05-09T16:50:08.971Z)

here when I talk about mapping the operating

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:50:09.368Z)

formats. Something like that.

### You (2025-05-09T16:50:12.021Z)

statements? Because it sounds to me like the process here is exactly the same as multi family. And I think most real estate would be, is that you're taking the information that getting from the broker or the seller but you are used to viewing it a particular way. So what you mentioned before is, you know, they take that information, they copy and paste it into their model. We want to eliminate the copy paste. So, you know, in RedIQ with the multifamily, what we do is that's all part of the creating the deal. Is you you you set up the property, and then you upload the financial statements a rent roll, all of the information and it gets extracted from that document and put into my system. And and that's what I mentioned before is in order to do that, the user has to map their chart of accounts to our chart of accounts. And it's kind of a you know, if you see the workflow, basically, they they upload the operating statement. We extract the data. And that data is mapped from the source document to their chart of accounts, at the same time, is also charted to our master chart of accounts. And so what we had also was a tool that we called SmartMap Plus. And it was not as smart as I wanted it to be, but it's it's something that we can easily address. It was built a few years ago before GPT, so it's basically just rules based.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:51:48.868Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:51:51.761Z)

But what what the idea was true is that they upload an operating statement

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:51:55.088Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:51:56.501Z)

And we take that operating statement and use the machine learning GPT

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:51:59.488Z)

Come on.

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:03.261Z)

to match it to the client. The best that we can. And then the client just has to go through and and make modifications, and then they can basically continue working in their format. Vinod, you were going to say something, I think. Something. That I was thinking of how we would I

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:25.558Z)

Just saying how I was thinking of how we could

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:28.451Z)

to

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:29.628Z)

eliminate, client manually kind of mapping to our

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:32.901Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:33.698Z)

chart of account. So, yeah, that is smart map plus

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:35.151Z)

Who's I think

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:38.168Z)

something. Yeah. That was one of the things that it is.

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:38.381Z)

so a lot

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:42.028Z)

I think so

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:44.371Z)

team. Like, and

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:46.118Z)

a lot of the

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:47.451Z)

an

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:47.858Z)

acquisition teams like and the ownership groups, like, they don't have their own chart of accounts.

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:48.931Z)

Charter account. But more at least not today, like, you Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:56.588Z)

Or at least not that they

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:58.661Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:59.308Z)

like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:52:59.441Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:52:59.828Z)

use

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:00.401Z)

Yeah. So, like, like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:01.638Z)

consistently. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:01.781Z)

some of is like, our company, right, three. Right? You know, they're accounting this

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:06.428Z)

yeah. So, like like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:07.181Z)

status. Know, this year.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:08.318Z)

Sunstone is like, our publicly traded REIT. Right? You know, their accounting office has a chart of accounts that they use

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:15.261Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:15.678Z)

And when they get

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:15.821Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:17.008Z)

p and l's from Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, whatever, they put everything into their chart of accounts for accounting purposes.

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:17.151Z)

Really Yeah. Looking at higher

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:22.118Z)

The acquisitions team doesn't really look at that. The acquisitions team is

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:24.381Z)

higher level, So I

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:26.098Z)

looking at things at a much higher level, much more, you know, much more summary level.

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:26.841Z)

it sounds they're being sort of like three ways happening.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:31.648Z)

So I don't know if

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:31.671Z)

Yeah. I know like necessary

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:33.908Z)

it sounds like you're talking about there being sort of, like, a three way mapping

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:34.921Z)

attractive. I mean, you're 80 The

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:37.488Z)

I I don't know if that's really

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:38.591Z)

potential tell you I

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:40.208Z)

necessary here. I think it might

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:40.741Z)

Or the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:42.008Z)

mean, you really you're the data you're getting from the

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:42.181Z)

right? And then are

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:44.378Z)

the

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:44.511Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:45.148Z)

potential hotel you're looking to buy

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:45.521Z)

create

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:47.328Z)

or that you've already bought.

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:47.851Z)

the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:48.798Z)

Right? And then there's our format. That you're putting it into the the model to to do, you know, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:54.061Z)

Yeah. Like, every Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:53:56.708Z)

into our chart of account. Like, Hotel BS is the same way. Like, we have a chart of accounts.

### You (2025-05-09T16:53:56.921Z)

Like, Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:00.668Z)

We, like, everything flows into that, but there is it's there it's it's just, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:02.271Z)

Okay. So so

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:05.248Z)

there's no, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:06.101Z)

I appreciate you clarifying that because I you know, we're used

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:06.368Z)

each customer doesn't create their own term accounts. We don't go down that road because that's a nightmare.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:10.141Z)

to a lot of the multifamily are both owners operators. Right? They they're they're gonna buy it, and they may have their own managed company. But it sounds to me like, you know, hotel, that's rarely the case. Where Like, you're gonna most investors are not aware

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:30.108Z)

Yeah. I mean,

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:33.311Z)

there.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:33.438Z)

like, you're gonna have yeah. Most investors are not operators.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:34.961Z)

Distinct. Yeah. They're very Okay. Then it's all your system is all we need really then is to to take whatever

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:38.238Z)

And even if they are, they're they're very distinct. They're very separate.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:42.441Z)

get from the broker and the seller and map it to

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:44.568Z)

And yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:45.731Z)

you know, what we what we would identify at least internally as the invest master chart of accounts, which would be the same as the HBIS. Same thing. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:55.298Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:55.451Z)

Okay. Alright. Yeah. That the

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:54:59.428Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-05-09T16:54:59.831Z)

get data. From

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:03.408Z)

Yeah. I think and I think for that, you know, getting

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:04.421Z)

it's not our system. In

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:06.598Z)

getting data from

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:07.241Z)

system.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:08.528Z)

the the p and l's where it's not in our system yet. Right? Like, these summary PNLs.

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:12.321Z)

Just

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:16.178Z)

Well, I guess,

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:18.851Z)

how

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:19.488Z)

the way

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:22.841Z)

like, an idea

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:23.568Z)

like, I don't know how

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:25.491Z)

what technology

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:25.908Z)

I mean, if you could just, I guess, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:28.341Z)

don't know.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:29.828Z)

in an ideal like, if I don't think about what technology what what I know or don't know about technology, if if the user could you know, just drop in these PNLs and the system could pull all the necessary data from them,

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:41.451Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:43.598Z)

and put it into the invest, like, populate historical tables.

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:44.991Z)

if that's also what

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:46.968Z)

That would be awesome. So if that's possible, fantastic.

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:51.371Z)

Yeah. That's possible.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:53.798Z)

Yeah. And that that's what I think we we should focus on.

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:56.931Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:55:58.168Z)

So we are the AI first company.

### You (2025-05-09T16:55:59.641Z)

search

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:00.468Z)

Okay. We are AI first company. Remember that? So I I yeah. My I my concern is always, these p and l's are

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:08.681Z)

I guess, yeah, first of all, they're they're also

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:09.488Z)

like, these ones from Davidson, you know, are are pretty consistent.

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:12.831Z)

place with like, those ones from the kids in

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:15.828Z)

I guess yeah. It was just like they're all over the place with you know, between different operators. Like, go to this one from McKibben.

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:26.651Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:33.518Z)

Drew, what would be great if you could provide one each format, like, whatever 23, 24 you have then we could probably figure out something. I provided so, like, to the four hotels, I provided, like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:47.811Z)

They're not gonna provide

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:48.438Z)

a couple of years. Right? So 24, 23, 22. And this is usually what you would get.

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:50.551Z)

See, right. Well, get all the year. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:53.228Z)

From a data room. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:53.441Z)

But if you

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:54.548Z)

they're not gonna provide

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:55.371Z)

they're not gonna do that. They're just gonna

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:56:56.148Z)

you theoretically, you have 12 PNLs a year. Right?

### You (2025-05-09T16:56:56.731Z)

give you the year end. You know? Which

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:00.438Z)

Right. If you're you know? But they're not gonna do that. They're just gonna give you the year end p and l.

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:01.821Z)

like a like, a period of

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:05.338Z)

Which

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:05.591Z)

Right? Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:06.428Z)

maybe it's

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:07.131Z)

it should be on '17.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:07.488Z)

a year maybe it's, like, a full year. Maybe it just shows, like, the Marriott one. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:13.081Z)

Date.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:13.208Z)

in this case,

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:13.341Z)

So in this case like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:14.398Z)

this is from 02/2017. It just shows February it shows December, and it shows year to date.

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:17.311Z)

full year.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:20.208Z)

So in this case, like, you're just gonna take year to date because that's your year end full year. This case, And then, like, in the case of the David this Davidson and McKibben p and l, it's you know, they're giving you month by month. Which is which is great. But yeah. But either way, they're gonna give you one for each year up until the current year. And then in the current year, you will start to get, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T16:57:42.261Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:57:46.158Z)

multiple you'll get, like, one p and l or one file for each month. Yeah. But and and so I guess what I my concern, I guess, is that there's just a lot of variability within, like, this one's got room sales, and then

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:09.211Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:12.888Z)

I think restaurant and lounge goes into f and b.

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:13.171Z)

I think that

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:16.488Z)

Guest communication and valet goes into other operated. And I think this

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:17.151Z)

Yeah. Drew, just just to to clarify here. I mean, this is

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:20.948Z)

other income is miscellaneous.

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:24.221Z)

I I don't wanna

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:24.558Z)

And

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:25.481Z)

downplay the complexity, but multifamily is

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:27.938Z)

it's

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:29.011Z)

a mess. I mean, there is no consistency in multifamily out Your revenue's on top and your expenses are on the bottom after that.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:58:35.068Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:58:36.481Z)

You know, in fact, there I mean, there's there's interchangeability even within that. So, you know, with the maintenance you know, carpet cleaning could be just in the maintenance. Or they could have a what they call the make ready or turnover. Expenses. Right? So you clean the carpet every time somebody moves out and somebody else moves in and one of the most confusing is utility reimbursements. If they bill their residence for their utility usage,

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:03.898Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:04.951Z)

some of them put it as a contra expense in the utility expenses. Some of them added into other income. So so so, I guess, bottom line is what you're describing here with the different various mappings is is something that we've

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:18.198Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:21.311Z)

we've dealt with for a number of years. On the multifamily side as well. So I think Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:31.868Z)

Okay. I just I think about, you know, we have however much time and and resources we have. Right? Like, I feel like this

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:42.021Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:45.128Z)

you could get it you could put a lot of time and money into this

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:47.091Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:49.428Z)

process

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:50.551Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:51.198Z)

it could be a black hole that takes you know, everything we have times a hundred.

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:56.301Z)

Company. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T16:59:57.968Z)

And, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T16:59:58.641Z)

You know. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:00.088Z)

and you could probably actually sell it stand alone to companies, right, that just wanna rip data from p and l's. You know? However, I think that is not

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:10.531Z)

We're at

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:10.668Z)

that is a that is a feature in what we are selling. Right? The other part of it that I think

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:11.541Z)

The part possible

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:16.298Z)

is going to be more valuable

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:17.981Z)

that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:18.268Z)

or at least the part that we're really gonna focus on selling is the model that it all goes into that users can

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:24.301Z)

Exactly.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:24.808Z)

then take that data and and, right, and and manipulate it and make projections on it, assumptions, and all that. So and and I I don't know We don't really know how much time or resources we have available We don't know how much

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:39.371Z)

I was

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:41.018Z)

either of these things are gonna take or at least I don't.

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:43.521Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:44.208Z)

So I don't want us to go, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T17:00:46.031Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:00:46.798Z)

I wanna make sure we don't go go overboard on this this part. You know? Right. I guess. So Yeah. I mean, initial would like, initial MVP probably we're gonna focus more on the data that we get from hotel PS. Right? Yeah. And that's why I offered that because I think it's just it's just it's easier to the data's there. It's easy. It's standardized. Like, it it makes everything much, much easier.

### You (2025-05-09T17:01:12.851Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:01:14.258Z)

And in the cases where data needs to get know, where it's not with hotel BIS, I mean, if even if it were, like, a a standard template, I did you know, open up Excel

### You (2025-05-09T17:01:28.501Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:01:29.636Z)

and you know, and they put in, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:01:31.921Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:01:33.196Z)

you know, it's something that they could download from our portal.

### You (2025-05-09T17:01:34.251Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:01:35.876Z)

Right? And then they can just go ahead and say, you know, like, room like, you know, room revenue and then, like, F and B. Other operated misc, and then you'd have, like, expense, you know, root room. And then, you know, similarly, then you have, like, put in your year, I mean, I know this is this is like, we wouldn't wanna do this forever, but it's we ask you know, the somebody had to say, okay. We don't have the data. It needs to get into the system. Right? Like, download this Excel

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:14.651Z)

I would

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:15.646Z)

put the numbers in here, and then reupload it.

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:16.361Z)

say, like, the full

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:17.886Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:18.751Z)

you know, like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:18.996Z)

that that would be the the simplest, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:19.551Z)

that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:21.986Z)

I wanna say, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:22.791Z)

You know?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:24.106Z)

not foolproof, but, like, you know, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:26.051Z)

To expect

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:26.816Z)

that would be the simplest way to do it with probably the least technological cost.

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:26.871Z)

to pick up.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:30.236Z)

You know? Yeah. And then this this is the cleanest way to extract

### You (2025-05-09T17:02:31.721Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:02:34.226Z)

the data, but I don't believe we'll get in this format at all times. Right? So, like, that is, I think, like, if we if we can keep that in mind, this this doing something like this as, like, the the easiest way to go about doing this. That's what's kind of the the base case. If we can improve upon that, and and and and set it up in such a way that users can just add a bunch of P and Ls you know, to a to a to a file upload thing, and then the system can pull that information. And the user can review it and tweak it if they want to and you you know, then that would be even better.

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:12.661Z)

I You know?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:14.176Z)

Yeah. That'll be a long term goal.

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:15.551Z)

Do it.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:15.976Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I I yes. We're certainly a long term goal. Some of you are wrong. I guess I don't know if that's

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:20.651Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:21.206Z)

you know, like, I don't know how easy that is to do an MVP.

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:23.711Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:25.906Z)

Yeah. You can do that in MVP. I mean, we can do simple extraction like, you know, if we get document in this form we can definitely do and, you know, some of the documents you are showing, they're much simpler.

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:35.821Z)

one that's saying.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:38.156Z)

But the one you showed in between there and multiple

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:39.751Z)

I think you case of but

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:42.076Z)

tabs and what all that's that sounded like very complicated. Yeah. I think in the case of like, in the case of this

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:52.581Z)

And so

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:53.106Z)

really detailed one,

### You (2025-05-09T17:03:53.161Z)

just to

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:03:55.156Z)

Yeah. This is this has multiple tabs with all the detail. Right? And so just to show like, this this one from McKinnon,

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:06.831Z)

just it's

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:06.936Z)

it has the same detail,

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:07.291Z)

just

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:08.696Z)

It's just down in lower pages. It's like, if you keep going down, then you're gonna get you know, this is the this is the this is admin, like, a and g department. This is the lounge and, you know, f and b. Right? All the detail is there. It just depends on how it's

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:23.831Z)

This service

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:24.126Z)

there's not there's not nearly as much detail here. Like, this is the select service hotel. That has very little operational complexity. Is a risk Carlton that is

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:32.651Z)

You know?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:32.826Z)

enormously complex, you know, tons more there's the chart of accounts, this probably has, like, over a thousand lines, and it's you know, a thousand different unique lines in the chart of accounts. This one probably has, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:42.231Z)

300.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:44.766Z)

50. Right? So and this one probably has you know, 350 or 400. Right? This and then this one, they didn't provide any detail. They just gave the summary.

### You (2025-05-09T17:04:55.741Z)

You you're probably

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:04:56.556Z)

And so you know, like, in a in a deal, like, in a in a new in a deal, you're probably gonna get you know, that have detail. Like, usually, they're gonna have the detail because seller buyers are gonna wanna look at the detail. But most of what we need, like, if you think about

### You (2025-05-09T17:05:13.431Z)

a

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:05:15.646Z)

our underwriting like, the structure, the the assumptions tab, right, like, at least for the first half. All of that data comes from for the most part, comes from the summary P and L. Right? Like, the rooms piece, f and b rev, like, you know, the our, like, underwriting projections and assumptions piece.

### You (2025-05-09T17:05:36.861Z)

which

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:05:37.976Z)

Pretty much aligns with what you have here. I mean, maybe and then if you go into the breakout, which, you know, will probably be a future state future thing that we work on, the breakout tabs then you would have to get data from the detail like, like, the detailed tabs or the detailed section of the p and l. But

### You (2025-05-09T17:05:55.161Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:05:57.076Z)

but at least for the first half, Yeah. It's all from the summary tab. So you just ignore the details. Right. I mean, the summary tab looks like a universal format. And that's yeah. And that's the thing. It is pretty like, you know, even in this this is the Marriott one. Right? Like, Marriott's a little bit unique. Because they, like, show, you know, revenues, and they don't show expenses here. They just show profit. But, you know, obviously, like, revenue minus profit equals expense. And then they have some other unique things. Like, they have this central training and relocation department, which generally just goes into a and g and it's in a slightly different order. But it's still there, you know, utilities,

### You (2025-05-09T17:06:34.781Z)

Right? And it it sync sense. So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:06:37.746Z)

information, and technology, property and maintenance, sales and marketing,

### You (2025-05-09T17:06:40.411Z)

doing

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:06:41.226Z)

admin in general. Right? And and and same for, like, So mean, one one thing I heard that Cherry was doing, which I thought was pretty cool. I don't know how easy this is to do. But Cherry set up a I think they called it, like, a like, a a manual mapping or manual mapping, where you basically could, like, the way I interpret it is you up you put a file, Like, you upload a file,

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:05.831Z)

okay. This call

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:06.606Z)

and I guess it pops up where somehow you indicate in that file

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:08.561Z)

to the year 02/2019.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:12.386Z)

like, okay. This column corresponds to to the year 02/2019. This column this row is, you know or this row is food rep it's your rooms revenue. This row is is F and B revenue. This is expenses. Right? So you you you basically

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:28.191Z)

Think

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:30.856Z)

set up the mapping yourself as the user and then you like, save it, and then you keep uploading files repeatedly. That use the same mapping. But it's but, basically, it's set it up in such a way that that the user can do it themselves.

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:46.031Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:48.486Z)

And

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:49.231Z)

Yeah. That's that's what I was referring to. And and

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:49.466Z)

you know, no one from Cherry has to get involved unless something goes wrong.

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:52.531Z)

and, Vinod, I don't think you would even be aware, but even before

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:07:54.006Z)

I think that's that's what Howard was mentioning earlier. Oh, that that's how

### You (2025-05-09T17:07:56.931Z)

Red IQ was acquired, I was working on a self mapping tool. To allow that. So I think we've got some at least a base to start off with on that. Yeah. I mean, that would if you could could because

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:17.556Z)

Yeah. Okay. I mean, that would be that would be super cool if if you could because, again, like, during a a deal, you're gonna get five years of history, ten years of history, and then you're gonna keep getting you know, as the deal progresses, you put in bids, might take three, four, five months.

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:32.991Z)

For the most part,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:33.836Z)

Right? You're gonna get updated

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:34.431Z)

So if you

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:35.616Z)

p and l's or forecasts, and and they're gonna come in that same format.

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:36.501Z)

had you know, put it

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:40.586Z)

For the most part. So

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:41.701Z)

know, it

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:42.556Z)

if you as the user, if you, you know, you put in a little bit of effort to, like, set up this mapping to read these files,

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:48.211Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:49.626Z)

it, you know, it does it does save time.

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:50.331Z)

Yeah. So, Drew, question here. You know, back at the beginning of the call, you mentioned that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:53.716Z)

Versus just

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:54.531Z)

there's a few the that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:08:56.286Z)

copying and pasting it in there. So yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:08:56.371Z)

you created these for folders in the sample financial statements, and these are all you know, from well known companies. Right? But you mentioned that some of them are pretty bad. Do you have any examples? I I actually added a folder to that now called outliers. So, you know, if you've got some of those that you would consider to be, the messy ones, And it kind of goes to the point as well that this isn't something we would do with the MVP, but, you know, it'd be nice to start thinking ahead of time as to how we would do the processing of those that don't fit into that nice little box that we wanna create. Yeah. It

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:09:47.636Z)

Yeah. It's not that they're like, if you're just looking at the summary page, it's not that things are

### You (2025-05-09T17:09:55.681Z)

Well, keep keep in mind you're absolutely right that the MVP will probably be focused

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:10:01.276Z)

I'm not sure if there's any that I would say or, like, like, me

### You (2025-05-09T17:10:04.431Z)

I mean, almost exclusively on this on the summary page. But we're gonna wanna get into the weeds in terms of a you know, in in terms of data. You know, I don't know how granular the STR report gets. The star report. Okay. Well, we wanna be able to get at least as granular on that. So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:10:25.696Z)

Not very.

### You (2025-05-09T17:10:26.781Z)

you know, I'm I'm concerned about the the one that you were showing where on

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:10:29.266Z)

Not very.

### You (2025-05-09T17:10:31.091Z)

summary page, they just show the profit. They don't show the actual revenue and the actual expense. And that's not going to be very helpful to us. Yeah. Yeah. The one that yeah. Yeah. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:10:45.906Z)

In the Marriott one, you mean?

### You (2025-05-09T17:10:48.231Z)

But

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:10:49.646Z)

Like, in this one? Yeah. This yeah. Marriott and some operators do this. But Marriott is the one that's most distinctive. On their summary p and l page,

### You (2025-05-09T17:10:59.301Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:01.006Z)

they show revenues and profits.

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:01.851Z)

Definitely

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:03.266Z)

For for the operating departments. Down here, this is obviously this is expensive.

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:03.591Z)

if if I that's how they do it.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:07.196Z)

These are expenses, but that there's definitely a pain in the ass. Like, it

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:10.041Z)

Profit.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:11.326Z)

it's but it's that's how they do it. Maybe in nope. This is also profits.

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:17.521Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:18.556Z)

And this one,

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:19.841Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:20.156Z)

has costs here. Their Marriott Pinot appeals are just weird. They operate a lot of hotels, and they're a huge company. Right? So

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:25.911Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:28.386Z)

that that's one that

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:29.501Z)

It's like

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:30.176Z)

maybe this actually, I would say, is one that's kind of the messiest.

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:30.561Z)

yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:34.906Z)

But it's also probably one of the most common like Marriott operating hotels. Right? Like, they of all the brands, all the you know, their I think the biggest hotel operator in the country

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:46.801Z)

It's

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:47.286Z)

is Ambridge. I can show you an Aimbridge p and l too. But and they're a third party. They're like a franchise company. And then but other than Aimbridge, I mean, Marriott is is up there. Marriott operates

### You (2025-05-09T17:11:56.081Z)

50 Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:11:58.676Z)

a lot of hotels themselves. And their p and l's are very, very weird. They're they're they're they're it's I say they're weird, because they're like like, you could see they, you know, they don't have expenses on there and whatever. But they're also kind of an industry standard. Like, everybody knows what a Marriott PNL looks like. Even even some of these these

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:19.271Z)

If

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:20.506Z)

these numberings that Marriott has in their P and L, like, these things, this total 98 that, like like, you talk to somebody who's like, oh, Marriott's format 98. They'll know what I'm talking about. It's and the it there's that

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:33.911Z)

Right? And

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:34.976Z)

particular they're that ubiquitous.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:36.051Z)

much more You know?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:37.506Z)

But this is one from Aimbridge.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:37.631Z)

With Chris.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:39.176Z)

Which is which is another huge operator. Right? And and so you could see much much more consistent, you know, very clean.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:45.241Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:46.326Z)

You know, oddity one oddity is they have franchise fees.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:47.431Z)

Freak pretty quick. Forward.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:49.676Z)

Broken out from sales marketing on the summary page, which is kinda unique.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:50.051Z)

Alright. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:54.186Z)

But otherwise,

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:54.871Z)

Have the details when things start to get messy.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:55.436Z)

for pretty straightforward.

### You (2025-05-09T17:12:57.581Z)

And and crazy and they're showing it all different different ways.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:12:58.716Z)

Yeah. The thing and and and when I say that it it is really, like, add to the details when things start to get messy. And and crazy, and they're showing in all kinds of different ways. But as far as the summary tab goes, yeah, it's probably, honestly, now that I think about the Marriott one, probably is the

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:12.551Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:15.196Z)

the most

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:15.481Z)

Alright. Yep.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:16.126Z)

complicated

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:18.541Z)

Then I'm gonna make that further go away.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:19.706Z)

just because it's so unique. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:23.211Z)

Yeah. Yeah. We certainly have enough to start with.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:31.776Z)

Yeah. I'll I'll load some more up there

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:34.371Z)

Yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:37.006Z)

maybe next week.

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:37.311Z)

Well, thank you.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:38.706Z)

As well. I'll to get, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:39.641Z)

So couple other questions then.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:40.366Z)

yeah. I'll try to get all the major operators.

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:44.481Z)

And it

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:45.306Z)

Well, thank you.

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:46.141Z)

may be

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:13:46.226Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:13:47.541Z)

too soon to even broach the subject, but I know you and Diane have been talking about you know, what what is the relationship between your organization and Invest? And you've already got a significant portion of the process where you're already extracting the data and putting it into a standardized format, And so, you know, at some point the question is going to be, do we just use your system? Or do we have to build our own or things like that? So, and again, you don't have to answer that because I know you guys are still having conversations. That's Yeah. It's one of it's okay. For the

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:32.246Z)

Yes. It I I think it's

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:34.371Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:34.906Z)

I mean, for the for for the

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:35.621Z)

I think that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:38.346Z)

foreseeable future, I think they would they would operate separately.

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:38.501Z)

that's in that to to help

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:41.086Z)

And we can

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:41.111Z)

stop.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:42.506Z)

you know,

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:43.161Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:43.446Z)

I don't think there's any reason for invest to to develop stuff that Hotel BIS already does.

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:52.941Z)

Don't have

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:52.996Z)

And and and the things that we're talking about with invest are things that

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:54.961Z)

and the work

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:56.286Z)

I've talked about with my with

### You (2025-05-09T17:14:57.421Z)

Yeah. And so

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:14:58.796Z)

my developers. We just don't have the resources and the coordination and whatnot to do it. Hence so it's like I I'm just like, it's not even

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:05.651Z)

we're

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:08.676Z)

not even like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:09.111Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:10.286Z)

theoretically, they could be competitors, but, know, we're we're we're I will we'll we'll never actually

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:11.911Z)

for them to work with him it. Work

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:15.166Z)

probably even get there.

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:16.271Z)

we're gonna talk to them.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:16.506Z)

So I think eventually, I would love for them to work hand in hand. We're we're in talks with profits or right now for

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:24.111Z)

Mhmm.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:26.606Z)

a, like, a full fledged very, very deep partnership. With like, to support some of their ownership groups, which would be awesome.

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:37.261Z)

That

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:37.266Z)

And if that works out, it would be

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:37.541Z)

this would part

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:39.546Z)

it would lead to an acquisition, hopefully, within a year.

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:39.851Z)

also the top of ground sort. Extent.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:43.086Z)

And if that happens, my hope is that this would be part of that as well. Because Diane has also been talking to profit

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:45.171Z)

So they're they're Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:49.376Z)

extensively. The same people that I'm talking to. Right? So they're very aware of this the opportunity that exists

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:56.491Z)

It

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:15:57.696Z)

that, you know, that that the niche that we're talking about.

### You (2025-05-09T17:15:57.971Z)

where

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:00.296Z)

And so I think my hope is that it just all be wherever wherever we are in the process, it all just gets

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:05.411Z)

starts it. Enter this. Market,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:08.786Z)

thrown into what profits were bought. And I just as as other companies start to enter this market, not

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:15.591Z)

Yep. And

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:15.936Z)

the invest thing, not the acquisition piece, but the asset management piece, there are two or three other companies

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:16.751Z)

and, honestly, like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:20.756Z)

that have gotten into the space and are doing a really good job, and in and honestly, like, they're what better funded than I am. I mean, I'm just bootstrapping this. It's just me.

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:26.771Z)

to

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:31.876Z)

So it's it's tough to compete. So being bought by by profits or or getting it is really like a like, for us, it kinda has to happen. Sooner rather than later.

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:42.001Z)

that we never do.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:44.506Z)

And, again, they're they're huge. So that's that's my my hope. And if that doesn't work out, some of these other companies have talked about partnering or buying us or merging or whatever. Like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:16:56.571Z)

With it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:16:58.486Z)

and, again, I think this would just my expectation would be that investment kinda come along with it. Think it would be it would it would so, like, if hotel BIS merges with

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:06.191Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:08.716Z)

with Profit Sword, then, you know,

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:10.551Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:10.926Z)

it would be great for Invest because you get that much more data to pull from.

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:13.051Z)

I'm sorry. Go ahead,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:15.026Z)

If we merged with somebody else, then, again, it would be the same sort of thing.

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:15.111Z)

No. I just consent that that you it be

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:19.666Z)

Yeah. That's what I'll actually no. I was just concerned that, you know, if

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:23.031Z)

yeah. In the CI. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:25.736Z)

hotel BIS get acquired,

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:25.741Z)

That would be nice. Like

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:27.966Z)

data will still be available for

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:29.351Z)

I yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:31.356Z)

Yeah. Invest CI. Yeah. Yeah. That would be I again, I think, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:35.421Z)

Investment

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:35.786Z)

I we we we haven't gone through, like, ownership structure.

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:38.581Z)

like

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:40.486Z)

Or any of it yet, but to me,

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:42.451Z)

of the value.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:42.466Z)

any investment

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:42.901Z)

Right? So so people are going to

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:44.756Z)

in my company and Hotel VIS like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:45.451Z)

want to keep it Yeah. Yeah. And even in the meantime, that's one of the things I was

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:47.946Z)

the relationship with with Invest is is part of the value. Right?

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:51.691Z)

thinking of is

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:51.836Z)

So so people are going to

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:53.391Z)

you know, if we can get that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:17:53.836Z)

want to keep it.

### You (2025-05-09T17:17:55.081Z)

process now, I shouldn't say if, it's when we get that process of extracting the data and populating a model. You know, we may bring in clients to invest that haven't been using HPIS. And if we use your system for extracting the data, you know, even if we could white label it, which is something I've done in the past where

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:18:18.656Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:18:19.291Z)

we don't actually do the processing. We would have it there. And then down at the bottom of the screen, you know, we'd we'd show something, you know, powered by HPIS. Right? So it shows kind of a partnership there. And then you get more data outside of your existing clients, and then, you know, we would be able to

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:18:38.686Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:18:40.791Z)

know, tag team or or tag along with your existing data extract. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:18:49.796Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And and and Yeah. And same the other going the other way around. Right? Like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:18:53.391Z)

Yeah. And Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:18:57.306Z)

when we get this to the right point, I absolutely intend to show it to all of our existing customers. And and because it's a different it's a different user group. Right? It's the acquisition

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:06.251Z)

As as far as, like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:19:06.876Z)

teams and the investment management teams more so than the, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:07.371Z)

what they're doing. So it's a whole another time. Idea. It's another way for us to get our

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:19:11.536Z)

asset management, just kinda one one level down as as far as, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:11.861Z)

get deeper with our existing customers. Yeah. So I guess from from my standpoint then, what I'm thinking of is, you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:19:15.726Z)

what they're doing. So it's a whole another you know, it's it's another way for us to get our

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:19.841Z)

where would we start? Where would Vinod want to focus

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:19:20.426Z)

get in deeper with our existing customers. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:23.851Z)

Would it be to focus on, you know, the initial data extraction or are there some gaps between what we need and what your maybe we just focus on that portion? I mean, I guess, from a strategy and roadmap standpoint, I just need a little bit of you know, clarification.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:19:48.776Z)

Yeah. I think well, so I'll go back to that. Kind of the the the flow. Right? Like, like, for for any of our, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:19:58.921Z)

I fully

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:00.556Z)

when we get the model, the assumptions

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:01.621Z)

the API customers and say, hey,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:03.576Z)

input, all that framework with the the models, and when that when that is set up, right,

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:04.871Z)

can use this to track the because hotel BS is a

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:07.726Z)

I fully intend like I said, we'll go to

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:08.271Z)

if you want add, like, like, I have all the portfolio revenue, expenses, profits,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:10.206Z)

HPIS customers and say, hey. We can use this to track the because

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:13.081Z)

You know, what are the returns? What are my effective returns?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:15.896Z)

Hotel BI doesn't if you wanted to ask, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:15.971Z)

Yeah. We can't tell you that. Right. That's, like, beyond the scope of

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:18.356Z)

like, I have all the portfolio revenues, expenses, profits,

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:19.231Z)

what our system is set up to do. But it has

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:21.616Z)

You know, what are the returns? What are my investment returns?

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:22.141Z)

most of the data. To do that, just not set up

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:24.556Z)

We can't tell you that.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:24.891Z)

to calculate it. Right? So what

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:26.216Z)

That's, like, beyond the scope of what our system is set up to do.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:26.361Z)

I think that it. Right? And that's a that's a unique value that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:29.676Z)

But it has most of the data to do that. It's just not set up

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:29.831Z)

So I think if anyone YouTube the

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:33.516Z)

to calculate it. Right? So, like, but invest is. Right? So that's a that's a unique value add. So I think I could say, hey. Look.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:35.501Z)

track

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:39.786Z)

Use the like, invest can can track all your returns and and investment performance

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:46.311Z)

And I think my hope is that

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:47.786Z)

for your existing assets, right, and do your quarter evaluation updates. That's awesome.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:48.561Z)

acquisition team will say, oh, I I will use this for property

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:51.676Z)

That data can come straight from h HPIS.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:53.391Z)

new properties that I'm looking to buy. Yep. Right?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:55.216Z)

And I think my hope is that

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:57.461Z)

New

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:20:57.506Z)

acquisitions teams will then be like, oh, I I wanna use this for properties new properties that I'm looking to buy.

### You (2025-05-09T17:20:57.771Z)

And that data is not coming be the

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:03.866Z)

Right? The ones that I'm just doing preliminary underwriting for.

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:05.791Z)

alternative

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:06.886Z)

And that data does not come it's not in Hotel BIA.

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:08.261Z)

you know,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:09.906Z)

So that would either have to be, you know, manually entered or use this alternative means of know, a mapping AI mapping or whatever to pull data from those summary panels. And and similarly, right, like, any new customer that we go to it's new to both of us. Right? Like, be like, hey. Look. Like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:30.331Z)

you're gonna start looking at things.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:30.766Z)

use this to underwrite all your hotels that you're underwriting right now. And any of them that you buy, you know, once you buy them, you're you're gonna start looking at things much more you're gonna have access to more data.

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:41.581Z)

And get

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:42.866Z)

Then you can run things through HBI. I mean, I guess you wouldn't have to if you didn't want to. You could keep using the summary p and l, like,

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:49.061Z)

best track. You know, and that was

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:21:49.856Z)

process. And manually type the information in. But my hope is that somebody be like, oh, okay. I'm I bought the hotel. I wanna use Invest track, you know, investment performance and whatnot.

### You (2025-05-09T17:21:57.191Z)

Yeah. Well, we're definitely on the same page there. I think that's

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:00.246Z)

And I now wanna use HBIS to do the more in-depth

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:03.341Z)

you know I agree that's the ultimate

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:04.016Z)

granular asset management analysis.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:05.761Z)

combination that would be

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:06.146Z)

Right? And so it would be, you know, that they would be good new customers for both of us.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:07.421Z)

pretty cool cool to get there. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Fanode, anything else?

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:15.806Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:17.731Z)

Just thinking.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:18.716Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:18.771Z)

If we can only integrate, like, how would that be actually just of be a part of one platform, and I was

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:21.736Z)

Alright.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:24.941Z)

add some sort of

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:25.296Z)

No. Just thinking if we kind of integrate with

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:25.711Z)

API. It's a problem. Customer uploads the data. On our

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:29.396Z)

hotel via as we be a part of one platform, and I wish

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:30.751Z)

Yeah. Which basically gets sent.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:33.006Z)

hotel via has had some sort of

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:33.371Z)

Over to the end. Where they get this

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:35.046Z)

APIs. So probably, you know, the customer uploads the data on our platform.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:35.461Z)

extracted sent back. To English. And

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:39.926Z)

Which basically gets sent to hotel b I s where it get this extracted. Sent back to invest and you know, we do all the reporting and create the model and all that. So that's

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:54.791Z)

To set

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:55.646Z)

another way.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:55.751Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:56.886Z)

We we do have.

### You (2025-05-09T17:22:57.041Z)

our data

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:22:58.326Z)

We do have an API. It's again, it was like, it was or I should say,

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:05.651Z)

The API

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:06.326Z)

our

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:07.121Z)

we're giving out

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:07.136Z)

data is set up

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:07.901Z)

specific Stuart.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:08.756Z)

Our data model is set up in such a way that

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:09.231Z)

So like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:10.896Z)

it can easily be extracted via API.

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:11.401Z)

yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:14.866Z)

The API that we have working right now is specific to one customer.

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:15.651Z)

You guys

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:18.466Z)

So it's, like, you know, Yeah. It's straight. So I think

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:20.641Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:22.606Z)

the reason I haven't gone down this road with with

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:23.241Z)

I

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:24.746Z)

you guys yet is because I think we'd set up a new API

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:27.461Z)

probably has

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:27.556Z)

And

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:28.401Z)

state here. But in other way,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:29.876Z)

I don't Yes. So so there are two ways I was thinking. One is extracting data

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:30.571Z)

is to send files from industry all the PR.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:35.186Z)

So that you are saying you probably has API. Right?

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:35.871Z)

Level. And then

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:38.386Z)

But then other way is to send the files from Invest AI into

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:43.111Z)

yeah. So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:44.136Z)

portal b I s let portal b I s to extraction.

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:44.521Z)

that and that's the reason I'm like,

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:47.596Z)

And then, you know, you already have the APIs to extract the data.

### You (2025-05-09T17:23:47.771Z)

two way. Two words. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:23:51.366Z)

And to invest. Yeah. So that and that's what little, like, two way two way. Yeah. We could do that as well. Yeah. I mean, that's how we get data data from from the operators and the same sort of it's not I mean, usually, not an API. It's like a, you know, a data push, but

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:04.771Z)

Alright. Cool. Cool.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:09.146Z)

but, yeah, we could definitely do that.

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:10.631Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:11.276Z)

But I I think I think that would just be part of what we would would do in in the future. Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:13.341Z)

Yeah. I don't I don't think I've got any other questions. Think that's really kind of what we wanted to cover is

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:17.756Z)

Cool.

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:20.521Z)

taking a look at some of these sample financials, I can't speak for Vinod, but I I think I feel very comfortable with with this because it actually even though you you mentioned that there's certain changes between them, I I don't think that it's anywhere near the scale that we're used

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:38.796Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:39.121Z)

to in multifamily. So I think it's little much cleaner than what we're used Yeah. Right. Right. So yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:51.266Z)

Yeah. Right. Right.

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:53.661Z)

Just good. Yep. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:55.166Z)

I think in some ways, you know, it's got its own complexities, but I guess in some ways, it is

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:58.401Z)

Improve that.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:24:59.366Z)

probably simpler, cleaner than the

### You (2025-05-09T17:24:59.701Z)

As part.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:01.606Z)

multifamily, which is which is good.

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:02.051Z)

So

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:03.456Z)

Yeah. I was just saying in the perspective of

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:05.381Z)

done.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:07.936Z)

including that as part of MVP.

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:10.221Z)

Yeah. Can we can get the summary, which is

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:11.736Z)

So, I mean,

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:13.101Z)

all that we need for an MVP.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:13.406Z)

simple extraction could be done, but not

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:15.711Z)

And we and then we can work on the the more detailed

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:16.556Z)

the, you know, all the kinds of document extraction.

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:19.781Z)

after the fact. So alright. Very good. Well, if I don't talk to you again this afternoon, I will talk to you next week, and have a great weekend.

### Guest (2025-05-09T17:25:31.556Z)

Yeah. It's it's Well,

### You (2025-05-09T17:25:33.601Z)
