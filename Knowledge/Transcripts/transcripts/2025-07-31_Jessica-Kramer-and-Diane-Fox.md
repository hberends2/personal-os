Recording in progress. Sorry to be running late here. How are you? Problem. Hi, Jessica. I know. Not not easy to, get together, but thank you for all your flex that you've had along the way. And all look

### You (2025-07-31T19:10:39.792Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:10:41.849Z)

at all our our our AIs are here and our our our friends and our virtual friends, but it's really

### You (2025-07-31T19:10:48.222Z)

Yeah. We'll we'll just let the bots take over. We can just kick back.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:10:52.449Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T19:10:54.422Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:10:54.829Z)

Exactly. Exactly. They're always listening. So, Jessica, to set the stage, I mean, probably some of this, but I'm friends with Carol Hensel. Yeah. I have been a client of Dragonfly. I love Carol. I love the work she's done. Every project she's ever worked on for me at various companies where I've been has been such a value add experience. And I also love how she built her team with, you know, building on around disciplines and also having a technology stack of, you know, integration component to her company. So, I am a hotel investor by background. I have spent twenty five years of my career either buying, selling, business development of some kind in the hotel business right on the ownership side. And then I've spent the other half on asset management. Mhmm. Or portfolio management. And today, I'm being joined by Howard. Howard, do you mind, jumping in and introducing yourself real quick?

### You (2025-07-31T19:11:57.392Z)

Sir, Jessica, good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the time to to meet with us.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:12:01.759Z)

Steve, good to meet

### You (2025-07-31T19:12:04.452Z)

I've been working with Diane on this project actually a little over two years. But

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:12:10.779Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-07-31T19:12:11.082Z)

pretty much full time since January. And like Diane, I come with an investment background and asset management background, but it's on the multifamily side. So this is kind of a new me to get involved in the hotel sector. But I did transition from asset management and multifamily into the proctech space about fifteen years ago. So for the last fifteen years, I've been on the technical side,

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:12:34.099Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T19:12:38.652Z)

working with some of the larger organizations, RealPage, lot of the utility billing management platforms out there, but most recently, a company called redIQ. Which is an evaluation model for multifamily.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:12:54.509Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-31T19:12:54.802Z)

So that's how I got involved with with Diane there. So

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:12:58.069Z)

Awesome. And yeah. I am on the co op board of five thousand person co op with 12 1,500 apartments and 20 retail spaces. So I have become familiar with the various RealPage software and I I'm in the process of implementing VTS

### You (2025-07-31T19:13:22.062Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:13:23.759Z)

at our

### You (2025-07-31T19:13:24.602Z)

That that

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:13:24.939Z)

complex. So Well, then then well, then you're gonna be have some familiarity because we're we're using some of those platforms. I mean, not not exactly a guide, but, so I worked at CBRE for a few years, and I worked in hotel advice Mhmm. I while I was there, I put together a strategy because I just didn't feel like us trying to go after third party asset management was scalable. Or would be profitable. So I think Bob Webster's team or no? That's Bob Webster's team. Bob's a good friend of mine. Yes. And so the only time friend. Yeah. He's wonderful, isn't he? He's a really, really he's one of the best brokers in the business. Definitely is. Bob said on the brokerage side, CBRE is a very this probably doesn't come as a surprise to you, a very siloed organization. So brokerage sits in one vertical valuation and appraisal sits in a completely different vertical, and yet there's another on research and then a vertical on the occupier space, which is VTF. Right? The VTS type of product. Yeah. Yeah. So our one of our big challenges was because we the hotel group wasn't all together, it was very hard to pull something like this off, like what I tried to do at CBRE, was essentially convince CBRE invest in a operating facing business intelligence called Autelier at the time, pivoted its technology around use it to digitize the hotel investment. Space or provide digital solutions for hotel investments. Mhmm. The two years I was at CBIRE, I did tons and tons of research, and I worked with the global software engineer for the appraisal team and Mhmm. Gentleman that ran global business analytics. And so I I did a lot of studying this space. And, essentially, came to the conclusion that in hotels, we're a decade behind the broader commercial real estate industry when it comes to having tools for investment. And there are wonderful tools for investment out there, pipeline management, deal cloud, deal path. Part of our strategy is a is a replication of that for hospitality. AVMs and multifamily, there there's probably seven to 10. Howard, and I met through, who owned at the time redIQ, and I was very interested in the AVM of it because takes forever to to take to pull the data together to value a hotel It's a very manual process. So I was very interested in how we could create something like that for hospitality. And then on the asset management side, we have some operationally facing platforms but nothing really on the real estate side that helps to pull real estate data all the way up through the the different We don't even they have real estate data that's very good. We've got crappy data from CoStar and essentially, something else. You know, maybe a little bit from lodging econometrics, which I don't really love as a company. Right. Let me I so do have a hard stop at 12:30. I wanna spend a lot of time with you on this. I love where you're going. What I would love to know from you to just, you know, kind of understand the conversation is what are you looking for in terms of help? Like, where do you need help? Where where could I be useful to you? And then just to give you a little bit on myself, you know, I have been a startup executive and founder. I've built lots of companies in hotel tech. You know, I came from I was a I was a real estate attorney at Sherman and Sterling. I went in house to a hotel company, Newport Hotel Group. Which Bob works very, very closely with. And has been our broker since the beginning of time and also I guess, many a summer. With Bob in Newport. So, you know, that is that is how I I I know him and and the CBRE, you know, and the former JLL team. But, you know, that's that's my experience on the and management side. But I helped Newport Hotel Group consolidate their technology. Under TravelClick, and make all the products work together and then said, work for us. Build out our mid market business. I took that business from a hundred to $350,000,000. In, three years. I mean, we many many, many people I'm not nearly claiming, TravelClick as my own project, but, you know, I I I built that mid market piece. And we sold the company to Toma Bravo. Three and a half years later and then subsequently to Amadeus. I then went in house to a hotel operations platform company called Alice. We sold it to Expedia four years later. I was their first sales leader. 10 employee. And now that is part of Actable under ASC Alpine. Yep. You know, you might be familiar with Propscore and some of their other tools. And then I went to Seven Rooms where I ran operations and strategy. And then subsequently partnerships and corp dev. We sold that company to DoorDash a few weeks ago. Congratulations. On that. Oh, yes. Very exciting one and very, very good outcome. For everyone. And then I I founded a company after that called Logistics Logistics. You have to pronounce it like lodging, but no one ever did. And then we sold that company to Kitsu, which is a text automation provider. So that's kind of, like, my background as a founder operator. But after that, I I kind of came out of all of that and said I don't really wanna found a company again. I don't have a company I wanna be the CEO or CRO of. You know? I I all I know is hotel restaurant, and travel tech go to market. And then suddenly, I had a consulting and advisory business just based off of mentioning that to a couple of friends. But what I found was that I was loving working with the earlier stage companies and the and the founders, you know, and and yeah. Okay. Of course, I can take business from Amadeus or even Dragonfly or you know, some of the bigger companies in the industry. But what I find is you know, what I what I find is that I love working with early stage founders. So I, ultimately said, you know, it doesn't make sense for those founders can't necessarily pay for me even fractionally, nearly in the same way that the bigger companies in industry can, but the go to market help is so much more valuable to them. And and the strategy and the that I have. And so I said, I think it has to be connected to the capital. I shopped it around to the venture capital in the industry and said, you know, why don't you bring me in to do this, make your portfolio companies more valuable, I met a team of people. In Silicon Valley that were raising a travel and hospitality tech vertical fund. And they said, that's that's the vision we have as well. Come in as an operating partner. Lead our scaler program. We do we do advisory engagements for companies from seed to series b. And and we bring them in. We work with them for twelve intensive weeks. And then over the course of six months. And and, you know, the idea really being that we, you know, help take companies from traction to scale with a focus on go to market, product market fit, and fundraising. You know? So we help companies. We put a little investment in. But we really help you syndicate investment. To a to a network of Silicon Valley 10% of the world's GDP. Right? So, you know, we have to, like, explain that to these folks, and we, like, say, you know, I see that you've invested in, you know, real page companies. I see that you've invested in tech, you know, like Yeah. This company should be really interesting to you because here's what they're building. Right? And so that's kind of, like, a little bit about me. I still work with some companies outside of the fund. So, you know, is something I do. And then, you know, I just I'm always excited to meet great founders solving big problems in hospitality, whether they're a fit for the fund or a fit for me. Consulting or advisory wise or simply, like, you know, new friends. Carol's been a friend of mine for over twenty years. I sit on her financial advisory board for Dragonfly and, you know, help have been helping them you know, make that company profitable and scalable. And in fact, I I I think there's a good life likelihood that we'll actually go further with Techne, with Dragonfly, you know, which would be really exciting for everyone. If we can, you know, bring all of those things together. But, you know, that's kind of Yes. I do is bring together all of my various people and help them connect with each other and then scale their business. Businesses and hopefully Right. Everyone makes money is a nice part of that know, something. That's great. So I know so I in in just a few minutes, because I know you have a hard and we'll continue this, is there are five cofounders. We've been working on this. For about six months. We're at the proof of concept phase quickly moving to an MVP, which we expect to have by Labor Day. The I've explained a little bit about what the product is. While there is competition, there's no one that I know of who's this exactly like we are. Right? Because I'm we're taking a page from the broader real estate industry and just bringing it in to a hotel because no one's gonna bring this to hotels except hotels people. Yep. We are pre seed at this point, so we are in Labor Day. We're going to be going out and seeking angel funding. Mhmm. We probably initially need about 500 k to get us I'll I'll call it well, we're right now, we're scraping by. As is. We're coming out of pocket to pay for some offshore developers. We're coming out of pocket to pay for some tools, but that isn't feasible for us, or sustainable for us. You know, even till the end of the year. So we, it's probably, like, 20 or 30,000 for what we're doing right now annualized, but we really, I think, you know, need about 4 or 500,000 to get us to the point where we can maybe then seek another round of pre seed capital. So it's and I would love to get your thoughts on this, but it's been suggested to us that we break up the raise into smaller chunks, because ultimately, it may be about $4,000,000 for two, two and a half years to get us to the series a funding of this. Mhmm. Like you said, hotels, you know, you think it's a very like, from a real estate people will say it only represents 7% of the industry. Right? But it's a very deep deep industry when you start to think about the a deal and how many people and constituents touch a deal. And that the workflows are all the same and they're being done manually over and over and over. So that's the pain point we're solving for is that real estate professionals spend 25 of their time doing nothing but manipulating data. It's a little bit like old school revenue when you guys used to have to do everything by hand. And so that's the pain point we're solving for. We'll have, probably a 100 plus API integrations as as that's in our future road map. Right? But right now, we just have to get the AVM POC built, and that's what we've done. And how and Howard Howard on why it works so well for us is that Howard and our chief technology officer have done this in multifamily. And they've done it in in a way that was commercially successful. RedIQ was the leading multifamily AVM platform, you know, in that space. It's now being it's now gaining competition And especially with AI, I'm not sure how that'll turn out. But we have two people who've actually done this as part of our team Right? So you've got hotel people plus technology leaders that have successfully done this. And when you put us together, it's an incredibly strong founding team. So we're at a good strong founding team. POC, moving quickly to MVP, looking for pre seed capital, probably looking for a lot of advice. On this as well. Right? Because how do we do this in a way that, benefits everyone and allows us to minimize the dilution of the, of the, of the founding parties, right, in this because, we're new this. We even though Howard and Bernard worked for redIQ, they were not the they were not the founders. Right? So all five of us are new technology founders. But we really have the expertise to do this. We have the market connect We have a good go to market strategy. So there's so much good about it but we're now networking and trying to understand what is the best path for us to capitalization.

### You (2025-07-31T19:28:07.212Z)

Yeah. Can I can I jump in here real quick, Diane?

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:28:09.659Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-31T19:28:11.162Z)

So so, Jessica, I know we've only got a couple minutes, so I'm gonna just be very

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:28:12.079Z)

Mhmm. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-31T19:28:15.652Z)

high high high high high level on this. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:28:17.139Z)

And let's just schedule more time, by the way. Like and then even tomorrow is

### You (2025-07-31T19:28:19.862Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:28:22.109Z)

fine. Like, you know, we should get more time.

### You (2025-07-31T19:28:22.222Z)

So we we've been talking about an AVM. Which which is very important. That that will be our core product, and we are set and in a position to where we will be able automate the vast majority of that. So no copy paste, no having to go here for the market data, and there among other data. That's all very good, but that's not really where the the where where where the where the funding or the excuse me. Where the money is. Right? Everybody talks about the money being in data. We will be collecting from our users pretty much the exact same data that they would provide to CoStar or some of these in order to get our historical data in the model so that they can use that to project forward. What really sets us apart that nobody else has is because we are an AVM, our users are projecting forward. What do they think the cap are gonna be in a market? What do they think, you know, the the the lending rates are gonna be? And and so we will be the only one who actually has forward looking data. Not just historical data. Be able to to to play that. So it puts us in a very, very unique spot.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:33.219Z)

Yeah. No one

### You (2025-07-31T19:29:35.402Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:36.359Z)

very familiar. You know, we built Demand three sixty at TravelClick.

### You (2025-07-31T19:29:37.692Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:40.669Z)

So, like, I I mean, you know, the static STR data compared to, like,

### You (2025-07-31T19:29:45.192Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:46.449Z)

the, you know, four Right.

### You (2025-07-31T19:29:47.282Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:48.759Z)

Forward looking you know? I mean, obviously, we were focused

### You (2025-07-31T19:29:50.852Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:29:52.259Z)

on demand data in that case, but, you know, it's it's same idea. Right? Like Mhmm. And I and I have some people that could be potentially, like, extremely valuable to you that built those products and and have have gone down that path. I mean, one thing I would say is five founders is a lot. That makes difficult to get venture investment. You know? So I I I think you need to think through, and I'd I'd love to understand when we talk again, you know, like, who you know, Yeah. But they each serve a very valuable role, so I I feel I and I do realize it's a lot. But I think if I explain what each person brings, and why the five of us kind of connect. And because each person does bring something that I it would be really hard to replicate in a, in an employee versus, in this co team. But I know we're at that. Can absolutely discuss it, but, I mean, I think to your point about dilution, you know, you had to have enough room on your cap table to be able to hire So, I mean Right. Let let's let's save it for tomorrow.

### You (2025-07-31T19:30:58.392Z)

Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:31:02.029Z)

Or or, you know, whenever we schedule time next. I do have a little bit of time, I believe, on my calendar tomorrow. If you take a look at my booking link, you'll find some opportunity. But if not tomorrow, next week Mhmm. The other thing is I would love to you know, whether it's next conversation or maybe actually the conversation after, I'd love to bring in you know, one of my two managing partners either Anjali or Manish at the fund because they are hotel owners and operators themselves. They own the Shashi Hotel Group, which has done a lot of properties in Silicon Valley, including you know, the main property at Google headquarters, also a property at Google. Yeah. You know? And they they have, like, they they they have had the highest grossing ALOFs in the Marriott portfolio That's impressive. Years. So, you know, like, they're they're they're very interesting. Real estate investors, and they're certainly gonna understand the need. Let's let's do one more regroup ourselves, then I think I think there's a lot of opportunity here for them to add value. And then, yeah, we can we can talk about what are what are the best ways that I can be helpful, that they can be helpful, you know, and and that that we can move you guys forward. But it's amazing to meet you. I love what you're doing, and I wanna hear lots more about it. I have a million questions. Let's schedule an hour. Okay. No. You did originally, so I took time away from

### You (2025-07-31T19:32:44.112Z)

Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-31T19:32:46.379Z)
