# Transcript for: Howard | Vinod weekly call

### You (2025-08-11T21:59:45.336Z)

We either need to reschedule the call or just keep it really short. I don't know if you had anything you needed.

### Guest (2025-08-11T21:59:53.255Z)

No, nothing very special. I mean, I saw your few tags. I kind of sitting a lot of things right now.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:02.376Z)

Things that I found. Oh, I know.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:05.255Z)

I just wouldn't go alert those. But I put an alarm or all that, so I'll hopefully. Now pay attention to that.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:07.816Z)

But I put in a lot more land. So hopefully now.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:14.055Z)

But yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:14.856Z)

This is not going on.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:15.175Z)

There's a lot going on with the team and work. This is not working. That is breaking the website. That waitlist was broken again for some reason. I don't know what happened.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:18.776Z)

This is not working. With broken again or something? And I don't know what happened.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:29.415Z)

I moved it from God. So there's no relation with code ID as such, but yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:29.416Z)

I hope it sound okay. There's no relation with Core Idea. Such.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:36.135Z)

There's something these guys are doing on infrastructure side. I think that broke it by some quick fix.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:36.216Z)

There's something entitled infrastructure side. All right. Quick fix. Do that.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:00:44.295Z)

Do that.

### You (2025-08-11T22:00:45.176Z)

All right, cool. Yeah. I know that's pretty urgent. But Diane has already gone through the calculations. Prd, and I think Drew is in the process of doing that as well. I don't think she found anything that was wrong. I think she wanted a couple added for future juice.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:01:08.295Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T22:01:09.736Z)

So I'll incorporate those, but, yeah. We're not going to be able to test unless those guys have the calculations. In there. I don't think any of them are really spelled out. In the individual prds.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:01:25.495Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-11T22:01:25.656Z)

Yeah. I'm all trying to.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:01:26.375Z)

Most probably you're going to see. The last logic that you had in the PRD documents. But then we'll update it with the latest, even though you might see the old logic first time.

### You (2025-08-11T22:01:36.376Z)

But update it with the latest. Even though you might see the old logic first time. Well, there's a couple of them. I found that, in fact, the biggest one is we had the inputs. After what's called the discount cache flow valuation method.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:01:58.455Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T22:01:59.896Z)

Which is totally different than the cap rate method. And the inputs were in the model. But we didn't have a separate calculation. We only had one calculation field. So that was like, one change where if you look at the PRD for the valuation. Page. The modal. Now there's like three value, There's a cap rate valuation, DCF valuation and then the valuation where they can manually input in there, right?

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:02:33.815Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-11T22:02:37.096Z)

They will calculate a fairly close number, but not always. One of the things I found is I did some research. Just on the hotel valuation.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:02:57.975Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-11T22:02:59.016Z)

And it actually said that the DCF is more common than the cap rate evaluation that you saw. Like, okay. If we go out with an MVP that doesn't have dcf, most of them are looking for that. That could be a bad sign. Right off the bat. So I'm glad I stumbled across that. And it's easy fix. Not a problem. Since we all did. All the data is already there.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:03:27.895Z)

Cool. I'll look into the tcf one.

### You (2025-08-11T22:03:30.456Z)

So what I've been doing then, on those. The PRDs where I've been making those changes. I put the track changes on, so it's really obvious. Everything's in red font. And, I mean, you can see all of the new things, the new items. Stand out pretty easily. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:03:48.775Z)

Yeah. I think yesterday I was seeing one of the DOC coins. It was showing that this document tracks changes.

### You (2025-08-11T22:03:49.896Z)

Yesterday I was seeing one of the dog plans that this document exchanges.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:03:56.855Z)

Then there Is it okay? Cool.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:02.936Z)

Out makes it pretty obvious.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:04:04.615Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:07.416Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:04:10.295Z)

All right. Anything else.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:12.696Z)

I don't know. I really don't. I think. Yeah. I think for the most part, I'm doing more on the administrative side again, like we talked about last week, that hasn't really changed. Should be all set. Just let you guys cut loose and build it. And if you see it I sending some email. Things are here and there.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:04:36.855Z)

And if you see like, you know, I sending some email, things are here and there. Don't worry.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:40.296Z)

Don't worry.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:04:41.175Z)

We'll adjust it. We'll correct it. It's not going to be perfect. First time.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:43.336Z)

It's not going to be perfect. First time.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:04:46.695Z)

Is always rough. So whatever change is required will make those not.

### You (2025-08-11T22:04:49.336Z)

Changes requirements. Always would be much better to look at it piece by piece than wait until everything's done and then have to go back and make mass changes. Hopefully we.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:05:04.775Z)

Log in. What else? The deal creation, Deal detail. That part is always work. Document upload. That's already working, so probably I can push that stage and you can have a look.

### You (2025-08-11T22:05:09.096Z)

Need to that article document upload. That's already working. So probably I can push them up the stage and you can have a look. Yeah. I was going to say, do we want to schedule, like, a weekly review where they can just. Take a demo what they've been working on. Or do you want to just have me log into Dev and play around with it? Whatever you guys want.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:05:36.455Z)

Yeah. I would just like to send it out as soon as it is ready.

### You (2025-08-11T22:05:37.496Z)

Just like to send it out as soon as it is ready. Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:05:40.775Z)

And then whoever wants to spend time and make changes suggest something, they can just have a look and. But I think Stage is the best environment because on Dev we are continuously releasing things.

### You (2025-08-11T22:05:41.016Z)

And then whoever wants to spend time. But. Because. I agree. Stage it would be best. I forgot to chat. That. That's good. Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:00.055Z)

And whenever something is stable, we can always push it there.

### You (2025-08-11T22:06:00.056Z)

And when something stable, we can always push it there.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:03.655Z)

And then test it from there.

### You (2025-08-11T22:06:03.976Z)

And then test it from there.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:06.135Z)

So I'm probably going to push something today night and I'll send an email, then you can have a look.

### You (2025-08-11T22:06:06.376Z)

So I'm proudly going to push something today. Right. And I'll send an email. Great. All right. Sounds good.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:15.815Z)

And then that way, probably people will feel more confident.

### You (2025-08-11T22:06:18.696Z)

And that things have.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:18.855Z)

Every week.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:40.375Z)

Every week. So then. Probably. I'll come down to two days.

### You (2025-08-11T22:06:43.336Z)

Probably. I'll come down to two days, and then that will be much easier.

### Guest (2025-08-11T22:06:45.255Z)
