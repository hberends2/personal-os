# Transcript for: Diane | Howard Admin Session

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:01:29.633Z)

Hello.

### You (2025-11-11T15:01:30.833Z)

Hey. Good morning.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:01:32.273Z)

Good morning.

### You (2025-11-11T15:01:34.353Z)

So that was a very good call.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:01:37.713Z)

You were probably like, what the hell is she doing? Why is she having this call?

### You (2025-11-11T15:01:43.553Z)

Oh, no, not at all.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:01:44.673Z)

And. Yes. No. Did you? I thought maybe it would be hard to connect the dots on why I was reaching out to Jim, but.

### You (2025-11-11T15:01:56.193Z)

Yeah. I could see your reaction when he brought up some of the names. And people that if he could help make some introductions. Or who knows? Maybe he want to get involved himself.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:02:12.513Z)

Yes. That's a little like. I mean, that is in the back of my mind a little bit. Like, if I would have made a different decision from the beginning, you know, maybe I should have gone to Jim Alderman and, you know, but anyway. Are you there?

### You (2025-11-11T15:02:29.953Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:02:30.753Z)

Okay? Main point is he's a very helpful person. He's a very kind person, but he's also well connected, and I think he can make introductions. And you never know what could come of it as well, right?

### You (2025-11-11T15:02:46.033Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:02:49.473Z)

So, okay, so we have this. And then I wanted to mention the call this afternoon with Mark Woodworth and with Bill Reynolds. That call. Bill Reynolds and Mark Ordon know each other very, very well. Too. But the whole reason I reached back out to Martin Worth is Mark Wood Worth, when he was at a company called PKF, took the first stab about 15 years ago of creating a. They sold the CBRE. CBRE. This is what Will was saying. They tried to push forward with. It was called Eva Interney. But CVRA couldn't do it. They couldn't, like, get out of their own way. And then Mark left CBRE after he sold his company to them. But with the research group at CBRE imploding, I wanted to see if there's an opportunity to revisit the data product. That cbre had called benchmarker.

### You (2025-11-11T15:03:58.193Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:03:59.073Z)

8,000 individual hotels in the United States where Mark. And a gentleman named. Oh, my goodness. By his name totally is keeping me. But his name is. He used to work for Mark. He's leaving cbre. I mean, maybe there's a way for us to partner with them on a 2.0 version of it, Right where Mark already has the relationships established with all the companies that are providing the data. Right? So he has all the management companies, the flags, the owners and things like that. Robert Mandelbaum is the name of the man that is leaving C. Beren at the end of December. And there's a high chance Robert will go work for Mark after he leaves cvre, and so Mark will probably want to resurrect that on his own, but it could be so much more valuable. Tied into an avm, right? Because the data itself, all those individual hotels with all those relationships already established. Maybe I just want to float the idea around with him potentially partnering on something like that, because that would start to. How do I want to say it? Like. I mean we open doors from a selling perspective to go in and now start to talk to all the management companies you're already providing your data to benchmark. Well, let's get you hooked up with invest and get the data synced in. Right. And the in software benchmarking. Possibility that could exist almost out of the gates is amazing. Would be amazing. So that's what we're going to chat about with him.

### You (2025-11-11T15:05:48.993Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:05:53.553Z)

At 4:00 today.

### You (2025-11-11T15:05:55.393Z)

Marc is the one we spoke to last week.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:05:59.873Z)

That is a young gentleman named Will Webster.

### You (2025-11-11T15:06:02.193Z)

Yeah. Okay. Because I thought he mentioned something about. Okay, okay, I get it.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:06:09.633Z)

It's all the same.

### You (2025-11-11T15:06:10.033Z)

Same group, okay?

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:06:11.073Z)

Like it's the same group. Mark Woodworth is probably in his late 70s, and he created this product back in the early 1990s, I think, or and monetized it successfully with his own consulting company, which he sold to cbre. Robert Mandel Minimum has always had always worked for Mark Woodworth, so he was kind of like the number two guy that ran all the data. And then Will is very young, right? You met him. So he's in his mid to late 30s. And he is the son of Bob Webster. Bob Webster is one of the best brokers, hotel brokers in the country. And then just to connect. The last dot is when we were talking to Jessica. Last fall, Jessica mentioned Bob Webster as well in their relationship. So it's like it's such an interconnected industry. But that's why I want to talk to Mark and see if there's any chance to potentially partner on this, because I think it could be game changing from a data perspective.

### You (2025-11-11T15:07:08.673Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Cool.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:07:22.033Z)

Ok. And then short of working for Kroger and getting the safe note on. That's all I've got today.

### You (2025-11-11T15:07:31.313Z)

Yeah, I don't have a whole lot either. I know that. We want to take a look at the LLC during our call today. I haven't had a chance to look at that yet. I will do that sometime today. I think the only question I had just based on the email, is why? I don't know why Drew is pushing. That we have to be W2 in order to get. Anything back. It seems like we could either just be. We could label this independent contractor. But I think we've had these discussions before, and I just. Maybe. Maybe I'm just forgetting the details as to why we wouldn't be independent contractor. So I appreciate you adding in the $2,000, but I've also got my out of pocket. Is almost $900 now. For all the views. So I would hope that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:08:39.393Z)

Weird and burst. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T15:08:40.273Z)

Document that and get reimbursed. I would love to get the $2,000, but if it's going to be an issue, it can certainly wait on that. Can't believe I'm saying.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:08:54.993Z)

No, I just feel like they're being so nitpicky about this. It's like we're just starting, right? Like we're not going to get audited. We're going to get an LLC done in the next 30 so days. I don't want anyone. I don't want you. Inventory about the timing of the llc. I have worked out with Driftwood. Right. So I'm just going to get the 12,500amonth for right now. And I'm going to put the 8500. Send you 2K. We'll do it, Venmo. Right? I don't care. We need the money right now, and I don't think we can be worrying. I feel like we're splitting hairs at this point over something and they're overcomplicating it when it's such a small amount of money.

### You (2025-11-11T15:09:35.313Z)

Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah. I agree. I don't think there's any issue whatsoever of you depositing the check. And, yeah, I don't see any reason to hold off or wait. We can trans.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:10:03.953Z)

We'll just do a reconciliation as soon as the bank account opens and, like, get all the. I mean, it's simple. We're not talking. And these are like, a person could do this in minutes, right? A few quick, you know, payment reconciliations, and then. So this first one. Let me then just pay you. Back the 900 to the 2000. Plus the 900. And that'll leave 1100. That I. I guess will go to Vinod, right? To help him with his engineering team. Or I might need to go to cover legal costs.

### You (2025-11-11T15:10:10.273Z)

Ition.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:10:39.313Z)

But. And I just. I have. Like. I mean, I worked at kruger. 40 hours a week, plus trying to get all these budgets done. Like, I don't know that my mind that I can actually focus on what the LLC issues are this afternoon. Like, just coming out of one thing that's as dense and moving into something else. Is it that bad? I just keep getting a sense from Drew that the LLC is like that. Like, I get a sense from Drew that I've done that bad of a job on the LLC that they feel the need to control it so much.

### You (2025-11-11T15:11:11.153Z)

Now. I don't know. I don't think you've done a bad job at all. I think you've done a good job. I think what Drew. And if this is what he's thinking, I actually agree. Is that we should not worry about the wording per se. That we need to let the attorney draft it the way it should be worded as long as the final result is what we intended. So, you know, that's why I was kind of thinking all along, is that, you know, maybe we just. All we needed to do was put together bullet points of, you know, I want. This to be changed this to be this, and then just let the attorney do the actual wording of it. I think that's one of the things that was probably, I think, Drew was concerned about, which, if, if, if I. If my assumption is correct, I kind of thought the same thing, too, that maybe we don't need to worry about, you know, rewriting it.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:12:16.193Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T15:12:20.353Z)

Just let. Let them know what we agree with, what we disagree with. What we want to change and let them worry about the wording so. Yeah, as long as at the end of the day, The terms, conditions, all of that stuff. Matches what we wanted it to be, that's. That's all we need, so. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:12:48.753Z)

I mean, Drew's complained about $1,000 of legal fees. I just. I mean, I feel. I mean, you can wrap up pretty seriously. Legal fees quickly when this. With these things get complicated. And with five partners. What I found when I was doing the research is there are complicated issues. You know what I mean? It's not like this in the simple proprietary. And so I was in my mind thinking we could be spending $25,000 on the negotiation of an LLC agreement with the attorney involved. I was really, genuinely trying to help.

### You (2025-11-11T15:13:08.273Z)

Yeah. No, I don't.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:13:24.833Z)

And I generally ran a crash past Sherburne in the beginning, and he was pretty good with it. But I. Have sadly almost destroyed that relationship just because I never got back to him. And now I need to go apologize. And I didn't know how to explain what was going on to him. Just. Does that make sense? Like, why we wouldn't want his partnership? And so I just put it to the side to try to get through paying for my, you know, like, finding ways to support my family, and now I've got to go. Make amends.

### You (2025-11-11T15:14:04.353Z)

That's all you need to say, is that, you know, with having to work at Kruger and all the other things, that things have just got. Overlooked and set aside. I mean, that. That would be fine. But no, I. You know, I really appreciate all the work that you put into it because that's. I mean, it is your little baby, and, you know, that should be satisfactory to you. But I think I kind of understand. What? Drew is concerned about the attorney fees because, I mean, he and Mark have put in money to get us through, and I think he's concerned that, you know, if we spend a lot of money on the attorney, then we won't be able to pay the developers, and somebody's gonna have to come up. With more money. And, you know, I kind of see both sides of it, but I don't think either side. Is wrong. You know, I think, you know, I can understand that. You know, they probably don't want to put up more money at this point, but. I don't think it's going to be that big a deal. Most of these things are canned anyways, so for them to go through and make a few changes, I don't think it's going to be that expensive. So, I mean, they've. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:15:27.633Z)

Okay? Okay? I just. I'm not sure that I really have it in my head, though, to, like, go through the issues, because when I was going through researching the issues, it was. It that dance issues, you know, I mean, it's like, okay, what happens if someone, you know. Now let's deal with all of the issues within the founder team that could happen and how we have to resolve them. Right? Let's deal with the employee. Pool. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. It was just a lot when really parsed into it and then my understanding how woefully.

### You (2025-11-11T15:16:03.153Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:16:13.553Z)

How woefully. How the draft agreement that Drew's attorney sent was just too simplistic. For a five member LLC where we all have equal percentages. Right. It was probably. I know we needed a template to start with, but it was an overly simplistic template that really needed a lot of work when we all said and done. Is not something we could have just signed because it missed all the challenges. And that's what the LLC is designed for. It's designed to cover when we can't agree on things and when we have problems. And so therefore, it really didn't contemplate the issues that a five member LLC could have. Because it wasn't drafted that way. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-11-11T15:17:04.593Z)

It makes sense. But number one, we can't anticipate any in every issue that could arise. And that's why I fall back that maybe the simplicity. Is advantageous in that. Really, it seems like all we need to decide is. Is to define. What needs a majority and what needs a super majority? I mean, we can change the llc weekly. We need so. So, yeah, I think trying to account for every issue that could arise or all these other things. Is almost an exercise in futility. Not to say that you wasted your time, because I think you have come up with a lot of things that needed to be addressed, and I appreciate that. But let's not worry too much about how we're going to resolve anything, because the resolution is a vote, and we just need to decide. In fact, I think what we would do is we would need to decide what needs a super majority, what needs four out of five votes. And then basically anything else just requires majority. So. You know, because there's no way we can put together a laundry list of what this needs and what that needs. We just need to say, okay, for changes to the LLC needs, super majority. I mean, there's probably only a couple, two or three items. That we had on that list. And if it doesn't match the supermajority, then it's a majority.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:18:39.633Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T15:18:44.193Z)

My question that I haven't read through it yet is. What determines the percentage. Is it just. 4 out of 5 votes. So does each member just cast a vote? Or is it based on equity, which today is the same thing? Everybody's got 20%. Well, nothing.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:19:06.353Z)

Yeah, it's voting rights. Voting rights could be different than equity rights, because at the end of the day, How I originally drafted it is if Drew and Mark decide to forego salary. And in my mind, when I drafted these people all working full time, right, which is something we have to discuss, then they since they have income, they could just defer their salary. And if they wanted to, that salary could be paid out by future fundraising. Or they could convert it to shares, but those shares would be non voting shares, so the partnership would always be 20. 20. 2020 or intermediate. 1818 or 15 50, whatever. It is equal amongst the five of us.

### You (2025-11-11T15:19:41.233Z)

But yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:19:51.313Z)

Even if some of us end up having more economic shares. But the voting shares have to have to stay where they are.

### You (2025-11-11T15:19:58.273Z)

Y. Eah. Okay, so then it basically is always going to be. Do we need 3 out of 5? For majority, or four out of five for supermajority. So that's. You know what? It's what it's going to boil down to. I. So I think. You know, what's also important is what we talked about last week is maybe having two different equity pools, one for employees. The other four key employees. And, you know, other than that. You know, something like that would probably require super majority. Anything having to do with equity and things like that, but I just. Yeah, I just kind of think in. In many cases, simpler is better.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:20:45.633Z)

One thing I'm struggling with is, like, on a technology side, I feel like we're doing really well. And I still don't actually understand what our business plan is like. I understand trying to go for customers. I understand trying to get early customers. I'm a little bit worried now that I've been following some news about how documentation for SEC companies or large companies is becoming a bigger obstacle. Right. Like they're cracking down and making it much harder that we could get caught in this legal loop with some big customers where we can't really get some things resolved as quickly as we hoped to to get the revenue coming in the door. I feel like Mark Andrew completely won a bootstrap this and I, I, I just don't think we need working capital, in my opinion. And I don't feel like we actually have a plan. Right. Like, does that make sense to say? These are the customers we're going to go after. But we need to try to raise 750k of working capital, and that means. X amount of safe notes. And so these are the people we're going to go after. I feel like, can't even get past. Like, if we're going to even do the safe, we're just going to try to bootstrap. And that, to me, is a pretty big thing. And I'll see agreement. I mean, we have to be able to have a way to handle disputes in how we craft our strategy. Right, so. How do we like as the LLC agreement stands today, how do we decide something like that? We don't. I mean, one, there's nothing that's been produced, right? There's no document we can all review that says no one sat down and said, okay, this is the business plan, right? We're going to try to go after these. Five clients. We think Peachtree could potentially float us 170k to get us to the final. You. You know, like, does this make sense? And then that. That then diminishes the need for safe notes because Drew's budget is underwhelming. Like, Drew does not have enough. Money in his budget, Frost next year. Right? He doesn't have. He doesn't like. Yeah. I mean, I guess he has a starting to pay people. By. I just feel like. Does he really have any money for Carrie in there? Does, you know, like, these are small amounts, but I'm rambling here. I just.

### You (2025-11-11T15:23:32.433Z)

I agree.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:23:34.033Z)

I like. I just don't think it's. We're going to need more than that to get through the next 12 months. And so we haven't completely landed on how much working capital we're going to need.

### You (2025-11-11T15:23:43.393Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:23:45.473Z)

Who we're going to need to bring on, and I don't know how the LLC dictates, because we're. We're in conflict. We don't agree on it. So now we need to go to the LLC to say, how do we resolve this? And I don't think that the LLC as it sits today. Would give us an answer on that. Does that make sense?

### You (2025-11-11T15:24:08.113Z)

Yeah, no, but I don't think the LLC needs to give us the answer. I think. What we. I mean, we need to put something in the LLC about, you know, that, yes, we will be fundraising, but it. The LLC is not the place to specify dollars. And hours and anything like that. You know, I think the llc. What?

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:24:33.633Z)

For dispute. It would, wouldn't it? Like, would it specify the dispute like we dispute among the five of us, how to do it?

### You (2025-11-11T15:24:40.993Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:24:41.393Z)

How do we figure out.

### You (2025-11-11T15:24:42.273Z)

That comes down to the majority in supermajority. It's going to have to be a vote. It's going to have to be something that we present and vote on. I haven't spoken directly to Drew. I know. I have heard Mark. You know, same thing. I haven't really specifically come out and asked him. I do know that Mark has mentioned concern about dilution. I've expressed concern about delusion, but that doesn't mean that we're opposed to getting. Funds and investors. It's just that we don't want to go out and get. A lot of money at the very beginning, it's like, almost like, okay. You know, home equity loan, right? I need this amount of money to fix this room. And then if I want to keep going, I can take more out of the home equity, right? Not that I would want to go out and just get a million dollars. And give away all of this equity. When I only need, you know, 150,000. I guess, you know, just. I'm pulling numbers out, but I think we all need to agree that we will need funding. Just leave it at that. Whether it's a safe note, whether we get somebody who's willing to put in a million dollars. We just need to agree on the terms, not whether or not we get funding. If so, I think that's probably where we're going to have to have. A decision on majority in supermajority and something like that. You know, we may want to just. What's that?

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:26:31.073Z)

It's a business plan, though. Right. I mean, it's a business plan. And to me, it feels like a business plan. And that we're going to need a way that if we disagree amongst ourselves, then how do we resolve that? Right? Like, I don't know how to get Mark to produce a business plan that I can wrap my head around. I. I look at your numbers and it's like, okay, I see you've got nice numbers and monthly, you know, amounts. But let's just walk through this the other way, which I feel like I've asked him so many times, is just look at it annually for a moment and say, we need to. Bring the note on.

### You (2025-11-11T15:26:35.473Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:27:09.313Z)

For one year. 150k, right? We need 150. Like, let's just say, like, that's what we need for him to be able to quit his job and come over. He's got no benefits. He's got nothing. He's got to pay that other company. We need you on board. We need. Me on board. We need Carrie or we need some marketing dollars. We need some AI support. If these data conversations take off, we would need some funding for someone like Will or try to figure something like that out. Right? So I'm not right? We're going to need conference dollars and some travel dollars that we don't. Have in there. And what I hear is, I hear Drew constantly saying, no, no, no, no to that right?

### You (2025-11-11T15:27:21.873Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:28:00.513Z)

But it. It was very unnerving for me to have Mark. Out at Phoenix and not be able to be there. With him because as much as he doesn't trust me to pitch things, I have not heard his pitch yet either to people on things. Right. And so it puts it makes me feel very, very nervous to have Mark just out there talking to people without being able to hear his pitch. Is he just pitching? Loan servicing because that's all he had a conversation with. With. With Access Point Financial. Right. Okay, that's good. But there's other people out there that can do that. Too, where it's not using our competitive advantage to help us. With the company. And so where I'm going with this is let's just start to say 150 +150 +150 153, 455 50, 650. We easily start to get to around 750k. 850k. Right. If you look out 18 months, maybe it's a million dollars. So we're not going to have revenue in that amount right out of the gates. It's going to take us some time.

### You (2025-11-11T15:29:11.313Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:29:20.033Z)

But could we go get 700k safe notes to help us cover this period? Yes, we could do that. Otherwise, we just stay in this perpetual hell where we can't push the product ahead because we're all working. Just only putting so many, so much time into it. And to me, that's the plan. Like, that's the plan that we need. That doesn't feel like we're. We're anywhere near being able to lock down something like that.

### You (2025-11-11T15:29:52.833Z)

So let's first address the semantics. Let's separate a budget from the business plan.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:30:03.393Z)

Ok?

Okay. So back in March, I had emailed everybody a business plan in terms of development and what we would want to do in the first year, three, five years, things like that. That's a business plan. That's already changed. Right. We were thinking the fully automated AI thing would probably be three years down the road. Now I'm thinking six months. Right. So the business plan has got to be fluid. It's got to change. It's nothing more than an arrow. Says go this way. It doesn't turn by turn. Instructions.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:30:40.433Z)

Agree. Right.

### You (2025-11-11T15:30:46.433Z)

But I do agree that what we need to do is we need to take Drew's budget and. Start. Being a little bit more specific. And show we need this amount of money. In order to do this. And again, it can't be by months. I mean. Things change. So I agree. We need to put down the different personnel that we need. The AI person and all, you know, the developers and maybe consulting hours for Carrie. And who else can we bring? That's what I agree. We need to get the budget portion nailed down.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:31:27.473Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-11T15:31:33.393Z)

And Mark and Drew and everybody, all five of us are going to have to say, okay, look, we need to be at this point next spring, and in order to do it, we need this amount of money. Without this amount of money. This is going to keep getting pushback. So, yeah, like in your example, if we say we need $750,000. By march. Then whether they get 750,000 next week or whatever. And it's not going to be one check, it's going to be incremental. At some point, we're going to have to do that. And again, that kind of goes back to the pools, which now, I mean,

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:32:08.433Z)

It's here.

### You (2025-11-11T15:32:18.033Z)

I've always considered the investors to be a separate pool, so we technically would need three different equity pools. But with the investor equity, that's going to have to be fluid. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:32:34.753Z)

It will dilute us. It does it with every company. That's just like life, right?

### You (2025-11-11T15:32:40.193Z)

Right. So as we start bringing in revenue,

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:32:43.873Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T15:32:47.873Z)

You know, we could be surprised. This thing could catch fire and go. Or it might take longer than we expect. But as our revenue goes up, then our investor needs are going to go down. And at some point that line's going to cross where revenue is going to carry us, so we don't need all this money. So that just kind of shows that we need to get revenue as quickly as we can. And in order to do that, we have to have some initial funds in order to do what needs to be done to get to that point.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:33:21.633Z)

I think I found a solution for and we're going to talk to them in early December. For a fractional CFO that also has tons of capex use a project manager. He worked at Rabbit. He worked at Taylor Bird. There's so many things he could he's such a multidimensional player that on a contract basis he could come in and help us. Maybe he becomes one of the first employees, right, that helps us and he gets. He's one of those 2 or 3%. But I also really like the idea. He's very. He's very technology oriented. He's actually not a hotel. Person at all. His dad is a. It's. Right. But he has this idea of creating a sticky. It's not. It doesn't go with the software business, but you're kind of helping owners piece together their technology stacks, Right? So it's like, okay. For the for again, for the nobles or the peach trees. It's like, okay, you want us. You need these three people. You know you're going to be using. You're already using mri. You're going to use us. This is how we're going to interface with mri. This is how we're going to interface up to Juniper, right? Like helping the companies to create the right tech stacks. Because then you become so. Sticky to them and so important to them that you're not just software. Does that make sense? Like. But it's. It's actually draw the line down. They're separate businesses with maybe some commonality between the two of them, but that helps you so that you're not just some random, you know. Small software company, you become indispensable to the hotel investment community because you're the one helping them put their tech stacks together and things like that. I love that. His way of thinking about that. So, like, so he's in my mind, like, you know, 50k to start, so that he could start to maybe step in on the CFO piece, but then start to help me. And then eventually you and me and him working through the capex like, how we're going to deal with getting, you know, where do what software are GCs using for hotel renovations? Right. Let's get that identified. Procore, North Spree, any others. Right. Okay. Who are the project managers? Right. How do we go in and start to work with those project managers? And the owners will say this is what you're already using. This is how we can create, like, an interface or some sort of agentic AI feature that allows us to pull the data out that we're doing manually right now. So I'm spewing this, but again, in my mind, it's like, okay, we're going to need to, like, layer the need for that cost in. And. And that's where I feel like we just don't really have a plan, or what it is is just disagreement, and we just ignore it and kick the can each week.

### You (2025-11-11T15:36:38.113Z)

Yeah. I just thought of something while we're talking, and I don't want to. Go down a rabbit holes for me, but I can create an online budget tool. Very quickly. I'll take Drew's spreadsheet and replicate it in terms of the rows. But it'll be online instead of on his hard drive. Number one, we don't all have access to the same sheet. And what we need is a way that we can just go online. Anybody can make an input or a change, but it'll have a change log so we'll know who made what change when. In addition, we'll have. We can do budget versus actual. So we spend this money or as we get this revenue. We'll log it just like we would, you know, keep our checkbooks updated. So we can track that all along. That that's really what we need is, you know. Be trusting of the five of us. Enough to have a tool like that, like I did with the CRM, with the other things where. Anybody can get in and see where we are. Add things that need to be done. You know we can. Could even set up a notification thing on there. You know, Howard just added $1,000 to this line item or something like that, right? Let me put that together.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:38:27.633Z)

Because right now, what's happening is. It's almost like Drew is completely controlling that conversation and. Right. And it's like. Well, no, we're not all quite in agreement with. With what you're putting out there. At least I'm not. And I. You know, there are things I've asked. Him to do that he ignores as well. About like does take the top down approach and just say you're trying to take a monthly up. I just, I just want to get my head around.

### You (2025-11-11T15:38:47.313Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:38:58.913Z)

Is it 750k then do we go out and start to get 3 to 475 to 100k checks? Every order, right? And we just go into a mode like that where that's how we're trying to fundraise. Like, to me, that's something I can put my head around because I believe we're going to get revenue, but I just. I don't think it's going to be. Day one. And I think we need to be looking out, like, more towards the end of 2026 for validation that the top couple, three clients, we don't even know we're in a price. Exactly. Yet. Right. And so for us to be thinking we can bootstrap this entire thing.

### You (2025-11-11T15:39:15.233Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:39:39.553Z)

I just think it puts us into another nine month cycle of us all working part time and this could die a slow death because it lacks the momentum to start to bring us on full time and allow us to do the work that we need to do to, to get it done so.

### You (2025-11-11T15:39:55.633Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:39:58.033Z)

I'm sorry. I'm obviously.

### You (2025-11-11T15:39:59.953Z)

No, that's great. At some point. We'll have an actual real financial management system.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:40:10.113Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T15:40:10.513Z)

Whether it's QuickBooks or whatever. Right. We're gonna have that, but I think. I think I can add that into the CRM. And limit access to that. Five of us. And. I mean, it really is going to be. It's. It's a simple thing to do. But that will give everybody access. You'll give everybody visibility. You know, we can represent things graphically. We can show, you know, here's our forecast. You know, we can say, okay, at this point, we actually start making money. And, you know, but we have to have the ability to. Have everybody. And, you know we've talked about this before, right? That I'll have authority over product. The Node will have authority over purchasing. For the technical team. The llc. I think we talked about imposing limits, whether that's either in the LLC or outside. Right. So, you know, if we go in there and we input 500 bucks in this month, we don't need to have a vote on it, but if we need 10,000, then we have to have a vote. And something that I think would be majority. I don't think we need super majority.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:41:25.073Z)

Great.

### You (2025-11-11T15:41:29.073Z)

On something like that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:41:33.313Z)

And that's something that is very good. Like even for you to task. If you have some time. It's like just start to think through what happens if this right? How does the ll call for something like that?

### You (2025-11-11T15:41:47.713Z)

That kind of goes back to what I said before is we have to identify the really important things that need a supermajority. And I think from what I recall, I'd already had a pretty good list in there. Of what? I mean, there's only. I think there's only, like, four or five items. If it doesn't meet those four or five items, then it's just a majority. Right, So I. Yeah. Yeah. We can't just come up with a list of everything. We just need to say this is. These are the super important things that we need. Four out of five. In fact, I even think there's a couple that we needed 100%.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:42:28.353Z)

No, I think I went back and took that out because I originally I thought that, but then when we started to have these internal conflicts, it's like nothing can require, not one single thing can require 100%.

### You (2025-11-11T15:42:29.953Z)

Yeah, I was gonna say. I remember we talked about that. Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:42:42.593Z)

Or else we could be deadlocked forever.

### You (2025-11-11T15:42:43.793Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So I just. I just really feel strongly that all we need to do is identify the super majority. Which will be a relatively small list, and then anything else is just a majority vote.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:42:56.753Z)

Because you and Benon and I could sit in one end and Mark and Drew could sit at the other end. Right. And even if we require four out of five, if we don't get the four out of five, we could just be stuck in, like, limbo somewhere, too, so. Right. And we also not we have not really worked out the fact that Mark Andrew don't plan to be full time on this. And so what are we going to do with the fact that. We need to pay for those roles. Right. And those roles aren't in the budget. There's. There's just so. I don't know.

### You (2025-11-11T15:43:32.913Z)

Yeah, I think we need to address that.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:43:33.393Z)

Go ahead.

### You (2025-11-11T15:43:37.233Z)

In terms of the salary, and I agree. If you're not gonna be a full time employee, why would you draw a full time salary? Equity. Yeah, they can grab their 20% all day long. Not a problem. But we should not be deferring salary. At least on a full time basis. I think we. I still think we need to be pro rata basis. If they're only putting in 10 hours a week, then they should only be getting 25% of whatever the salary is. So that's a hill I'm willing to die on. Because for me, this is already my full time job. And if I was getting the paid the same as Drew and Mark.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:44:22.113Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-11-11T15:44:25.633Z)

But they're not putting in 40 hours a week or 60 hours a week or whatever it is. Why would they be getting the same paycheck?

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:44:33.153Z)

Right. And originally I thought they would be working full time. I was my intention that we would all be working full time. It wasn't my intention that some of us would stay part time forever. How much have Drew and Mark put into the business so far? Do you know?

### You (2025-11-11T15:44:56.033Z)

Drew has been doing a lot of testing. I think Drew has been putting in, you know, at least 10 or 15 hours a week. I mean, I don't know how long he's sitting at the computer helping out and uploading. The financial statements and testing. I mean, he's been doing a lot of work on the llc, so he has done things that I have seen. Mark. No idea. Other than working on the pitch deck. Which could be one or two hours a week. I have no clue what he's done time wise.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:45:36.993Z)

Right. And what about money wise? How much money have they each? Submitted because I feel like this is an area that's very untransparent and.

### You (2025-11-11T15:45:49.393Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:45:52.033Z)

Can be used. As a way for them to become primary decision makers, because they're the one footing the financial bill for it. And I appreciate. Their foot footing the financial bill. I truly do for the software engineers. But. It creates an imbalance. I think this point with that funding it, and I. I just want to try to understand, like, how much money. Less concerned about Drew, but how much money has Mark actually written a check for? In case that maybe that ever has to get repaid to him.

### You (2025-11-11T15:46:31.073Z)

Yeah. I don't know.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:46:33.553Z)

And it. Yeah, okay.

### You (2025-11-11T15:46:34.673Z)

But here's what I would do. They would be lumped into the investor pool. So what? I don't care how much money they write a check for, it doesn't give them any additional voting power. None whatsoever. But they would be part of the investor equity pool. So between Driftwood and Mark and Drew, we've already got three investors. Right. Mark Andrew. I mean, they cut pretty small checks, so would not be anywhere near. But what I would be doing is on this budget tool. That I would be putting up. You know, we would have a separate section for revenue. Investments and then expenses. So the investment side, we would already have three inputs. Right. Revenue zero. But it would be one of those things where we would, you know, I would create the modal. I didn't put Mark's name, date and amount. And same for June. Whatever. And so we'll track it that way. That's kind of going back to my earlier question, is for the voting, is it by per person or is it by per equity? And so.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:48:01.073Z)

It's. It's the voting shares are by person. I mean, it's what it's intended.

### You (2025-11-11T15:48:04.273Z)

Yeah, exactly. Because of this reason. Like what happens when one of us invests money.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:48:05.953Z)

Right.

### You (2025-11-11T15:48:12.833Z)

Does it give a more voting percentage or not? And that's. Yeah. So that way, whatever they put in.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:48:16.753Z)

Now.

### You (2025-11-11T15:48:21.153Z)

Would have to come out of equity. So, you know.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:48:26.273Z)

Same if like same if very sadly say I got hit by a boss tomorrow, right? And my equity shares. My son and daughter like get my equity shares.

### You (2025-11-11T15:48:38.913Z)

Here.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:48:39.153Z)

They don't get voting shares. They're not right. Part of the decision making of the company. They are. They? Because they would succeed, right? That I would be, you know, my will or whatever, it would be granting them those. But that doesn't allow them. Power in the business. Right. Unless the partners who are left vote to give them voting shares. Right. But it that, you know, and that's why some of those things in the agreement exist. It's like to deal with those situations, what if one of us goes bankrupt? What happens then? Right? Because literally, I sit on the edge of bankruptcy every day. And so can you guys all just kick me out if I go bankrupt? Right? That's like. There's. There's a lot of things like that that are in there when you start to start to parse through it. What happened? I mean, what happens if this doesn't work? Out, and one member needs to go, like, how do we. How. How do we affect that? Like, yeah.

### You (2025-11-11T15:49:44.673Z)

I remember all of those were addressed in there. And I thought I didn't really have any issues with either. But in terms of getting hit by a bus, if I recall correctly, and we'll have to take a look at that, I think. That we could at any time designate. You know, who gets my shares if I get hit by a bus. But I think at the time that you designate, you know, because I think all of us would put our spouses down, you know, it's just like any other life insurance or anything like that. I think that when we designate who would get our share, we can also designate whether they have. Ownership, or do they just get equity? So. I would put down my wife and I would say, if I get hit by a bus, she gets my 20% and she gets.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:50:46.753Z)

Voting shares.

### You (2025-11-11T15:50:47.073Z)

Morning shares. Because. Yeah, I can see, you know, the minute something happens to one of us and we got four on, you know, four equal shares. We wouldn't have any way of getting a super majority. You know? Yeah, I don't know how that would happen.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:51:07.873Z)

So that's one of those things that probably does need to get discussed. Right? Because that could happen. I mean, and sadly, that's what an LLC is designed to intent. Right. To cover. It's like, what does happen? Something.

### You (2025-11-11T15:51:16.353Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:51:20.353Z)

Happens to us.

### You (2025-11-11T15:51:22.273Z)

Y. Eah. All right. I need to spend some time. Just going one more time through that just to see if we can answer these questions.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:51:31.473Z)

Okay? Well, thank you, Howard. This was. I know I wasn't the most upbeat person in the world. I'm gonna go turn my attention to my budgets and try to knock some of those out. And then 4 o'clock, if you think it's a weird call again. I just wanted you to have the background. I'm trying to lay some groundwork for, you know, a high, high level discussion of partnership around. You know, taking that benchmark of product and seeing if we couldn't keep it going somehow. Okay?

### You (2025-11-11T15:52:02.673Z)

Okay. So, yeah, we'll. We'll take a look at that, and hopefully we can. Come to a decision by. The end of the call on the llc. As long as we. Agree on whatever the terms are. I need to take a look at that again. So okay.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:52:22.193Z)

If you. I'm a 4 o'clock call too. I mean not the full demo, but do you think you could pull up at least the dev site and show like here is the pipeline management piece and here is what the perform a piece looks like and we can just talk a little bit about the data extraction and the success. And just so that Mark Woodworth can see that the AVM actually has been created. Does that make sense? Does it need to be an hour down? It just needs to show. Show him that we have, in fact, done it. We've created an exam.

### You (2025-11-11T15:52:46.993Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I can show both the proof of concept which would actually show more because they still have not updated the staging environment so it still show layout and everything. But I do have a demo site. I have uploaded a financial statement into it so they can.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:52:55.633Z)

Yeah, okay.

### You (2025-11-11T15:53:14.353Z)

Between the two, though. Get a good picture of it? Yeah, There should only take 10, 15 minutes stops, so.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:53:20.513Z)

Right. And that's the main thing is I just want to show Mark Woodworth we did it. We created an avm. We're like. We're not quite to the finish line yet, but we're so close. It's. It's, you know, I. We've been spent a year on. This. Why would you want to spend a year on this trying to do something like this? Just common work with us on this, so, yeah. Okay? Very good. Thanks, Howard.

### You (2025-11-11T15:53:43.393Z)

You later.

### Guest (2025-11-11T15:53:44.753Z)
