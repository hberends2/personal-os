I think so. Howard, since I'm in the car, do you mind just, like, kicking it off and leading it?

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:05.886Z)

You mind just like, kicking it off and leaving it? For a bit?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:09.067Z)

For a bit?

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:12.596Z)

We yeah. I am as well. She says she's in the car, so

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:19.716Z)

She said she did the car, so I'm guessing it's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:22.107Z)

I'm guessing it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:22.486Z)

speaker. Is she who

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:23.417Z)

speaker issue.

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:24.826Z)

Yeah. Okay. But she said she said

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:27.157Z)

But she said if she said to just

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:28.676Z)

to to go and get started with you.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:30.337Z)

go ahead and get started, you if you were you wanna start us off

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:30.966Z)

Wanna start us off. On day.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:03:33.457Z)

on things,

### You (2025-07-07T19:03:34.376Z)

Oh, Alright. You can do that. Diane and I met earlier today, and I just wanted to remind everybody we do need to get our input suggestions, into the Trello board. So let me I just wanna show and remind everybody where it is. Come on. Me see. This folks, I'm just having trouble with the showing the the right page here. I yeah. I know where it is. I as well. And Mark, you you're not using Teams. Right? Right. No. I can try. Yeah. I I understand everybody's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:04:46.237Z)

I I mean, I think I know where it is and

### You (2025-07-07T19:04:48.706Z)

able to access it. I did share the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:04:50.427Z)

And Mark, you're you're not using Teams. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:04:56.636Z)

I did share the link.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:04:57.087Z)

No. I can try.

### You (2025-07-07T19:05:01.226Z)

And I don't know why it's taking so long. This is there we go. Alright. So if you can page that I'm sharing, is it visible now? The the chalkboard? Okay. Alright. So there's a couple things that we have set aside here. So I've got us a column here for anything having to do with AI. So whatever you feel that we would have an AI use for,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:05:32.497Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:05:34.376Z)

I don't care if it's something we can do out of the gate or if it's something that's gonna take us three years to develop. Just wanna make sure we capture every potential idea here. So I've already started a couple of items on there. These are probably some near term there are plenty more that I've got written down, so I'll go ahead and add some cards here. You know, Mark, if you're not I mentioned in the email, if you're not accessing Teams, that's fine. You can just email me a list of ideas, and I can add them here as well. The second list over here that we're calling the parking lot this is everything else. Right? If it's not AI use case, but any other thing that we should be adding to the the road map this is where we can add it here. Now what is this is this is a two step process. I'm gonna stop sharing this, and I'm gonna share the second one. So before I do that, you see this column here called Jira Jira discovery. As you know, we are using Jira for the, backlog and for myself and Vinod to track the development. So all of these items are items that I had originally added here in the idea list and that I've already transferred over to Jira. And so that is the next step here. And I go back to that page that I originally Okay. So does everybody see this page that I have of disc Yep. Okay. So this is this is our road map. This is, theoretically, where we keep every single idea of everything that we want to develop. You know, as long as it takes the node having to code something it it goes on this list. This isn't someplace where we would put, like, marketing ideas or, you know, things like that. So this is just basically what we're listing here. What we will be doing once we are comfortable with the POC and we wanna start talking about other items in the MVP, everything else. We, the five of us, will be meeting on a regular basis and we're gonna review every one of these ideas. We're gonna score these ideas. And the higher the score, the that that moves it up on the road map. Lower the score means, you know, it's not as good. We can get to it later. So, for example, the deal creation, the valuation model MVP, we're already in progress on that. Those are the two highest things here. But as a team, we will be evaluating primarily the impact. So that is what value will this provide our users? Some of them will be a five. You know? We absolutely have to do this. It could be a three. It could be a one. Right? Some of these ideas may not be something we have. Here, I've got a mobile version. We may not ever wanna do a mobile version. Right? So that could be a one. But once the five of us agree to an impact, then we go with a confidence score. And, basically, that is bait it's it's like the a sanity check. Like, we're gonna give this a five, are we 100% confident that every client will want this feature? Right? Or are we not so confident Right? It might be a 77. It could be a 23. I mean, what we'll do is we'll end up assigning a confidence score here. Once we've done that, this third column, this is Vinod. This is where he is gonna come in here and based on the information that we have here, know, we'll have to fill out some of these descriptions. He's gonna estimate how difficult this is going to be to build. And the more dots, the more difficult it is. K? And so this tool is designed to take all three of these items and come up with a score. So clearly, the ones that are gonna be higher scoring are those that have a huge impact impact, We're very confident on and to have very little development effort. Right? The ones that we probably will never do are the ones that have a low impact, you know, low income or low confidence score and a high amount of effort to develop it. You know, there'd be no reason to spend all of those resources developing something that very few people want. Right? So this then is going to be collectively how we decide what features we're going to build and then when we're going to build them. So once we have come up with these scores, we have a stage here. So anything that's new things that have not been reviewed or scored. If we're going to work on them, we can add them to the road map. And on the road map, you can see here we've got different options We can do it now. We can do it next. We can do it later. Or we can just say we're not gonna do k? So those those are ones that we're gonna use. We're not gonna get down into dates. We're not gonna say we're gonna do this the March. You know, we'll we'll get in there, and we'll we'll we'll prioritize it this way. And then once an item is moved into now, that's basically what we're gonna be working on, then we can put down a projected target date as to when we think this is going to be ready. And this is gonna be based on the node, and his level of effort here. And we'll go on there. So, essentially, then when one of these items is complete, we'll move it to the complete status. And then the next item in the later stage will be moved to now. So we can go back and and reassign it So that's how things keep moving through the process. So we don't ever come to a standstill. We make sure that we've always got a project that Vinod is and and the team can start working on. And and and that's it. So any any questions on the Jira Road map? Yeah. Our view like, my to how we did define it. To be like, discuss it and and agree Could be something that maybe drives no revenue, but customers you know, are really want Right? It's what they it prevents us from losing revenue sort thing. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. If we should be getting some sort of stuff that we're Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:05.177Z)

Yeah. Howard, have you like, I guess, it comes to how we define

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:05.506Z)

Every one of these is subjective. There's there's no set formula. Right? So you're right. We could we could

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:09.607Z)

impacts, is this just something we should we just, like, discuss it and and

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:14.466Z)

be discussing something that will generate revenue, or it might save expenses.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:16.477Z)

agree on, or should should we come up with an additional sort of waiting system? Because impact could be

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:20.126Z)

You know? It's it's always there. Or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:21.747Z)

you know, something that drives a lot of revenue,

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:22.316Z)

maybe not generate revenue or expenses, but

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:24.477Z)

could be something that maybe drives no revenue, but

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:25.846Z)

would be a reason why users would

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:27.517Z)

customers

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:28.766Z)

continue

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:28.827Z)

know, are really, really want

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:29.606Z)

to use the product and renew.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:30.627Z)

Right? So it's sort of a

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:31.696Z)

When their contract expires. Right? So, yeah,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:32.157Z)

you know, prevent us from losing revenue sort of sort of thing.

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:34.546Z)

that's in impact is very subjective, so is confidence.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:36.067Z)

Okay. So just we just we can just sort of and rate

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:38.586Z)

Right? I might feel very strongly that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:13:39.617Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T19:13:41.496Z)

you know, all of our clients are gonna want this particular feature. The rest of you are scratching their heads like, why are we doing it all? Right? So then we discuss you know, I'd say, why am I confident? Why are you not confident? And there again, we would we would come to come to an alignment. Right? So Is it worth, is it is it possible to or worse having notes to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:04.907Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:08.146Z)

make it possible to, like, that specific Excel. To say why would they that is how that confidence is high. Low confidence as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, I can we've we've got a column here for comments. We can Okay. Certainly add things in here. Yeah. There's there's more. And and this is you can customize it. I can add there's a whole list of work over here that we can add. So this is just the base. And and also, let me point out the reason why

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:35.567Z)

Is it worth, is it is it possible to or worse

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:36.826Z)

I'm having you input ideas on the Jira board

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:39.207Z)

adding notes to

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:40.166Z)

and then I move them here is because we're using the free level.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:42.597Z)

maybe not I mean, if possible to, like, that specific cell,

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:43.656Z)

Of Jira. And so there's only limited numbers. I I think there's only

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:46.247Z)

to say, you know, why do we think impact is high, confidence

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:48.026Z)

two of us that can access Jira. If we have more than that, we gotta start paying.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:49.267Z)

is high, or impact is low, confidence is low. Is that possible, or is more

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:53.616Z)

So, you know, at at at some at some point, you know, we can we can start

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:14:55.707Z)

okay. There's a

### You (2025-07-07T19:14:58.336Z)

an actual paying subscription to this, and everybody can have access to this.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:15:01.117Z)

Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T19:15:02.796Z)

Add ideas. We don't have to go through that process. So other questions?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:15:08.367Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T19:15:09.266Z)

Comments? K. Alright. Yeah. That I mean, that that's what I wanted to bring up during today's call. There there's been other progress being made on the on the valuation model. Mark, I'm actually in the middle of breaking out the closing costs, like you said. So the way I envision it is the users will have a choice. They can either say, x percentage of the loan or I wanna break out the detail. I might actually have something ready by the end of the day on that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:15:46.137Z)

No. I think this is good.

### You (2025-07-07T19:15:46.576Z)

And we can show that. But I'll I'll go ahead and send out a recording as usual. Great. You. Yep. Alright, Diane. All yours. Stuff that you've been doing on that with this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can see that with the exception of what I'm building with Mark. I'm not gonna get into the details, but I don't have enough, my subscription level for the tool that I'm using doesn't give me enough to to keep going.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:16:21.567Z)

No. Great.

### You (2025-07-07T19:16:23.286Z)

So I'm actually using two different tools. When I run out of credits on one, I go and make some on the other.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:16:26.887Z)

Great. Thank you.

### You (2025-07-07T19:16:30.556Z)

So I that that's where I stand right now. So but I will I'll I'll send a I'll send a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:16:36.657Z)

We can still view the latest stuff that you've been doing on that

### You (2025-07-07T19:16:36.976Z)

I'll send a video. And and you can take a look at that. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:16:39.987Z)

What is it? Possible a lovable page. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:16:42.256Z)

just real quick. There's no data model behind this. Right? I mean, there's no persistent memory There's also no data model. Right? No. No. It's it's just the the numbers that you see in here for historical are just hard carded numbers that basically, I just used what was in the Excel model that I was using it at the time. So you know, it's at least it's a realistic number for whatever

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:03.987Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T19:17:06.366Z)

data point it is. But that's that's one thing that we that we need to talk about is before we can have anybody outside of the five of us start

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:16.037Z)

Okay. And just to real quick. There's no data model behind this.

### You (2025-07-07T19:17:18.336Z)

testing it. We have to have a way of importing

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:21.147Z)

Right? I mean, there's no persistent memory. There's also no data model. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:17:21.796Z)

actual real data. From a deal. Yeah. So that they can go ahead and do an actual test underwriting.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:28.077Z)

This is hard code.

### You (2025-07-07T19:17:30.686Z)

Yeah. So that might have be a good segue. Which to start

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:38.247Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:17:38.276Z)

we talked earlier, Howard, like, we could do action historically information aside, right, because it's sitting hard coded in that model, But if our Drew, and I applied, can pretty soon go into the model you created and at least start putting inputs in. And sure that that's like, the calculations are working correctly. Right? Like, the RevPAR is being calculated correctly.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:17:59.657Z)

Yeah. Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:04.696Z)

Expense and and then we can get down to the NOI line. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:06.747Z)

Yeah. So that might actually be a good segue, which

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:09.066Z)

Actually, can even get below that with the capital expenditures.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:12.447Z)

to start,

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:12.656Z)

There are a couple of sample rows there. But

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:14.407Z)

we had talked earlier, Howard, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:16.576Z)

that's that's one thing I wanted to point out. The reason why I have to kinda use two models is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:16.787Z)

we could be actually historical information aside, right, because it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:21.546Z)

and I've mentioned before, that I pretty much maxed out

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:22.617Z)

sitting hard coded in that model,

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:24.686Z)

the capabilities of what this tool is designed to do.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:24.927Z)

if Mark and Drew and I wanted, we could pretty soon go into the model you created and at least start putting input

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:29.656Z)

And things tend to the the the whack a mole has been very active

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:32.677Z)

in and making sure that the like, the calculations are working

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:35.146Z)

so that I did make some enhancements, but then the drop down list

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:36.657Z)

Right? Like, that RevPAR is being calculated correctly and

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:40.076Z)

for the expenses where you can choose to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:40.187Z)

rooms expense and and that we we can get down to the NOI line. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:42.886Z)

forecast using the POR

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:18:44.927Z)

We we

### You (2025-07-07T19:18:45.906Z)

the percentage of revenue, or just input a number. Those were removed somehow from the the un or the, yeah, the nonoperating expenses and the unallocated expenses. They're still in the other expenses. So you can still see how it works. Right? I just need to add those back into the other one. So you could literally go in this afternoon and even just use the existing historical data and you can start inputting numbers. The revenue is working fine. No changes in the revenue. The expense because of all the different possible variations of how to forecast it. Where it's it's having difficulty. But you can you can see on the other operating expenses. You can choose any one of those three options, see how it works. And just know that same thing will happen for the other ones. Is it important that so I guess, like, what the process type for video to take this and transfer it to a more robust coding application. Right? Because I Yeah. Like, how much is it what this thing that we need to perfect. Right? Know, like, there's so, like, how now versus focusing on on the to start working on the more cost

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:22.277Z)

Is it

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:24.016Z)

interface. Yeah. No. Across.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:25.867Z)

more yeah. So is it, I guess, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:26.416Z)

Yes. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:29.017Z)

what's the process like for Vinod to take this and then

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:29.956Z)

this we could kind of I mean, I would feel in this one, how it works.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:32.997Z)

transfer it to a more

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:36.136Z)

We can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:36.197Z)

robust coding

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:37.046Z)

kind of use it

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:38.107Z)

application.

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:39.206Z)

to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:39.957Z)

Right? I guess I'm because the the reason the reason I'm asking is like, how much is it like, this thing doesn't need to be perfect. Right? You know, like, there's

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:47.016Z)

just copy it. Store. This little bit work that we've done.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:49.017Z)

so, like, how much more time do we spend on it

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:51.166Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:51.397Z)

now versus

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:52.316Z)

Probably we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:53.687Z)

focusing on getting what the note

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:53.796Z)

the things are in components or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:20:56.307Z)

getting set up so the node can start working on the the more robust

### You (2025-07-07T19:20:56.986Z)

something goes as is. But then this is like, hardcore values. This needs

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:00.247Z)

interface or or or products.

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:02.886Z)

to be collected to the API service.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:05.227Z)

Yes. So this, we could kind of I mean, everything in this world logic works. We can kind of use it

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:13.076Z)

And then what happens to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:15.847Z)

to, you know, validate

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:16.336Z)

elements on the browser. So, yeah,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:19.827Z)

things, but, yeah, this

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:22.066Z)

lot of work after this. But it will be very

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:22.547Z)

we cannot just copy paste or

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:24.866Z)

useful

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:25.177Z)

there's lot of work that needs to be done.

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:25.996Z)

from support

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:27.437Z)

So probably we could

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:29.456Z)

product.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:30.137Z)

take certain components or some tables as is.

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:30.156Z)

Perspective and to understand the product how things could work on the final

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:35.077Z)

But then this is, like, a hard coded values. This needs to be connected the API service

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:42.736Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:43.207Z)

which will eventually interact with the database. The data needs to be fetched

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:46.176Z)

for

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:47.977Z)

on the browser and then map to

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:50.676Z)

not much.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:50.997Z)

these elements on the browsers.

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:51.786Z)

So I guess that's,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:54.527Z)

So, yeah, there's definitely

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:55.916Z)

like, how would that like? You go back to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:21:58.387Z)

lot of work after this, but this would be very useful

### You (2025-07-07T19:21:59.596Z)

not by the for small things.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:02.277Z)

from what do you call,

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:04.686Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:05.957Z)

perspective, right, to understand the product, how things should work on the final

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:10.516Z)

Yeah. No. That that's that's a good point. You know, a lot of these things,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:12.607Z)

version of the product, how, you know, the

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:14.526Z)

in the whole world,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:16.107Z)

what you call, logic would work.

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:17.196Z)

don't think it's worth for me to go back and fix because, know, like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:19.217Z)

So this is definitely useful, but, yeah, there's a lot of work to be done after this.

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:20.686Z)

like the the drop down example. It's working in the other income.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:24.187Z)

Yeah. Use but it's probably not it's not worth spending, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:24.876Z)

And it would probably be much easier for for Node see how that's working there and then apply it to the ones where it's not.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:28.277Z)

I guess I'm, like, like, how many times do we wanna keep keep going back to this and and updating it and

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:32.876Z)

Where where it isn't then it would be from

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:36.207Z)

it?

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:36.236Z)

to try to fix it at the risk of breaking something else somewhere else.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:36.777Z)

For small things versus big things?

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:40.866Z)

So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:41.087Z)

Yeah. Guess it sounds like we're we're kinda reaching the end of the road of

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:42.906Z)

Demo with someone I work in POC.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:22:44.527Z)

how much we wanna continue to modify this particular

### You (2025-07-07T19:22:45.666Z)

We could fix the major part of it and then, you know, you know. Yeah. Last week. Talk line, which I think that's what started to talk about. Right? Right. And what do we eat? Eat? One thing just before we go in there. This like, another big part of this is that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:16.417Z)

Yeah. But yeah, I mean, but if we want to demo someone a working POC,

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:20.076Z)

of the day draft in to, like, a box and get

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:22.197Z)

we could fix the major part of it and then, you know, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:22.946Z)

populated. But to do it like you we just had a a long conversation

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:27.067Z)

Yeah. And that's that's that's yet I mean,

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:27.996Z)

on Friday. The proof of concept

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:30.237Z)

Diane and Mark and I were talking a little bit about

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:31.096Z)

do we start to show people the proof

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:32.937Z)

that

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:33.036Z)

concept? Or do we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:34.057Z)

last week to make sure you know, to get our own thoughts aligned, which

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:34.486Z)

enjoy? Into the to show people And

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:37.257Z)

think, Diane, that's what you were starting to talk about. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:37.866Z)

then what is it gonna cost us from today

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:39.477Z)

Right. Like, when do we

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:40.796Z)

to get to some

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:41.657Z)

well, one thing just before we go in there, I think Howard said this morning,

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:42.246Z)

and MVP? That people outside the five of us could start to play around with.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:45.907Z)

another big part of this is that

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:48.196Z)

Yeah. Because

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:48.417Z)

you and he need to, like, start to talk more about how we're actually gonna pull the data

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:49.236Z)

seemed to be, like, circling the same thing. It's like we're hitting this roadblock.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:53.117Z)

from hotel biz.

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:53.896Z)

Which is we need to get

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:54.977Z)

Or how we do the drop in of the data into, like, a box

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:56.056Z)

up into the please explain.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:23:58.837Z)

and get it populated. But to to your point, Drew,

### You (2025-07-07T19:23:58.856Z)

My my bad. Everything correct. Here, but I need to, like

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:02.247Z)

we just had a a long conversation on Friday about

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:04.936Z)

it. In the web.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:06.017Z)

what's the proof of concept, when do we start to show people the proof of concept, Or do we need to wait to the MVP to show people?

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:11.836Z)

So we solve this

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:13.827Z)

And then what is it gonna cost us from today to get

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:14.896Z)

problem? So fun problem.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:17.927Z)

to some MVP that

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:18.566Z)

What like you know, four or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:21.147Z)

people outside of the five of us could start to play around with.

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:21.656Z)

six weeks making that up?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:25.297Z)

Because we seem to be, like, we're circling the same thing. It's like we're hitting this roadblock

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:25.756Z)

It $10,000? Is it it, like, what is it that we need?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:30.267Z)

right, which is we need to get it up into the the

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:30.336Z)

To spend in order to get it to I I think, we call MVP. Right? Something that's others outside of

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:34.637Z)

please excuse my if I'm my vernacular if it's incorrect here, but into, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:38.056Z)

five year could touch.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:38.557Z)

AWS, right, we need a place to host it in the web, and

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:39.796Z)

Yeah. I think that is change. See if you're seeing

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:42.867Z)

we need work to be done, but there's a cost associated with that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:44.276Z)

the cost and time to get

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:46.637Z)

And we don't have any funds. So kind of where how do we solve this

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:46.866Z)

from one the other And what we discussed last week, we being

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:51.627Z)

problem? And if it's a

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:52.576Z)

our Diane and myself

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:53.177Z)

funding problem,

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:53.846Z)

a second December call to not hold

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:55.307Z)

what is the, like, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:55.696Z)

through. Operate its components.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:24:57.237Z)

four or six week, I'm making that up, funding gap

### You (2025-07-07T19:24:58.216Z)

And thought that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:00.947Z)

that we need. Is it $10,000? Is it, you know, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:01.926Z)

something outside of the five of us. Test. This POC, but

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:05.077Z)

what is it that we need to spend in order to get it

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:05.096Z)

we would think want it to be like. Somebody that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:09.687Z)

to

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:10.546Z)

that's right. I'll get it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:10.637Z)

I think it would be called an MVP. Right? Something that others outside of the five of us could touch. Yeah. And I think that is the difference between the POC versus the MVP and the cost and time to get from one to the other.

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:24.276Z)

And then

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:25.017Z)

I think what we discussed last week

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:25.606Z)

then

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:27.577Z)

we being Mark, Diane, and myself, we had a set kind of a separate call about the sort of operational business components and thought that having some we can have somebody, like, somebody outside of the five of us test this POC, but we would only want it to be, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:42.336Z)

you know, six months.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:43.417Z)

somebody that's

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:44.196Z)

And you said

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:45.587Z)

like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:25:46.206Z)

messages, but for the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:25:47.687Z)

Best friends. Not gonna yeah. That's like yeah. Friend. A good friend, basically. But, you know, and that will be their feedback and understanding. And that would only be after we ourselves thoroughly test it as well.

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:00.456Z)

three.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:01.157Z)

And then we would wanna take that feedback, incorporate it,

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:03.066Z)

On either two or the higher side,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:05.397Z)

and and and then start working on on moving to the MVP. But in order to do that, we

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:10.176Z)

per volume if we're not doing

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:10.887Z)

need funds. Some, you know, stop gap amount of money, which

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:11.746Z)

AI? That Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:14.717Z)

you know, based on your estimate, sounds like it's not

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:15.466Z)

So okay.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:17.747Z)

If if we were to say,

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:17.806Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:19.347Z)

you know, six months, and I think you'd said in your messages,

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:25.756Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:27.927Z)

Yeah. If we are doing any machine learning normal trading line related to AI, the cost is not that significant. So in my message, I said, way between $3.50 to $700 per month. On the high that too on the higher side.

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:47.646Z)

Trying to do. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:48.287Z)

$350 to $700 per month if we're not doing any AI. Is is that what I Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:50.316Z)

the two things of you. One is we get just queue sync. Already.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:56.147Z)

Yeah. I remember

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:56.216Z)

Margin for certain feature.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:26:58.877Z)

So okay. So

### You (2025-07-07T19:26:59.846Z)

What what exactly that we wanna help

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:01.617Z)

this is not so okay. So that I mean,

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:02.066Z)

And then I'm with the parties.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:04.077Z)

let's call it $500 a month. Let's let's, like, bring it out to six months.

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:06.266Z)

Model.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:07.957Z)

Right? I mean, so what are we talking about? Was that $3,000?

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:09.916Z)

That caused you which cost you the for that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:14.597Z)

And then I think, you know, Vinod, you talked about wanting a maybe an additional resource.

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:19.656Z)

Know,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:20.507Z)

For $500 a month.

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:20.846Z)

resources.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:23.227Z)

But what about what about if we added in the AI? Well, how much more would that be? Depends, like, what are we trying to do. So are two things. Okay? One is we can just use the

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:33.096Z)

Conversation. Have

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:36.907Z)

already available model for

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:37.276Z)

inspect it out?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:39.417Z)

certain feature. I don't know what

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:41.246Z)

That

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:42.197Z)

what exact feature we wanna develop. And then the another part is

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:42.806Z)

kind of felt me. Case. With the office so that we can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:45.967Z)

we want to create our own map model or retrain

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:47.836Z)

really make it decision as to act

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:50.357Z)

the existing model. Right? That cost money. That cost a lot of computer pop.

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:52.046Z)

agree. That the next most critical, period.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:55.337Z)

Compute powers which cost money.

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:55.716Z)

To our future for this. And

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:27:57.827Z)

For that, we'll need the data as well as, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:27:58.996Z)

you know, just really understand exactly what

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:01.877Z)

cloud resources.

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:02.826Z)

capital d is. So that we can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:04.927Z)

But how do we get all this like, how can we develop a spreadsheet that just has all of these line items

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:04.966Z)

discuss what resources are available.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:09.897Z)

so that we could really make a decision because I I I feel like we're we're starting to have the same conversation. And and is there a way to just map it out spend an hour and really just create you know, a six month budget that kind of shows base case and then maybe a more advanced case with AI so that we could really

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:28.286Z)

This budget. So just

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:30.437Z)

make a decision as to how we capitalize this because, you know, I think we all agree

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:31.976Z)

the POC Right? Cloud.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:34.567Z)

that the next three to six months are kind of the most critical periods who are

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:34.666Z)

No one. Advancement to the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:38.277Z)

future for this

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:39.366Z)

To the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:40.427Z)

And

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:40.556Z)

Okay. The

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:41.647Z)

you know, we should just really understand exactly what the capital need is

### You (2025-07-07T19:28:43.636Z)

Got it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:28:45.807Z)

so that we can discuss what resources are available. Yeah. I mean, definitely, we can discuss the feature the features we want to have in the application and based on that, we can come up with the budget. But for now, whatever provided, that is based on the POC that we already have up and running for that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:03.866Z)

Such a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:08.237Z)

Need minimum

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:08.856Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:10.537Z)

in this budget. For just the POC. To be put into the cloud, not to get

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:16.376Z)

Actual

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:17.707Z)

advancement to the MVP. I mean, to get to the MVP.

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:19.816Z)

After

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:22.857Z)

Without machine learning or AI capabilities. Got it. Got it. Okay. How much we would need.

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:29.386Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:29.867Z)

On monthly basis. And that and includes the the

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:31.866Z)

Yeah. That's what they call ETL, abstract transform.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:33.467Z)

what I think is the probably the most challenging

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:36.086Z)

And old.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:36.357Z)

or one of the more challenging parts is the data model.

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:37.856Z)

And you know,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:38.717Z)

Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:39.226Z)

different all these different cloud services has their own process

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:39.967Z)

if you imagine that we have data flowing in all the time, how does that data get organized

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:43.806Z)

the way I did when didn't have any budget.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:45.467Z)

in such a way that it means something

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:46.356Z)

We're just writing Python script and expect data from

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:49.237Z)

to the interface. Right? Yeah. This interface is gonna have on it. It has

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:51.166Z)

actual that you provided to put it in. The database.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:54.647Z)

you know, revenues and expenses and years and months and

### You (2025-07-07T19:29:54.776Z)

But that's not gonna work. The production level application. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:29:58.477Z)

actuals, budget. Right? All these different things, these different

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:01.046Z)

Things.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:02.037Z)

attributes which you

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:03.686Z)

Tools.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:04.127Z)

one would use to, like, organize and filter data, and those have to be properly put into the data model so that the data

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:08.876Z)

They get processed. So so let me

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:11.687Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Wanna find a data point to do that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:12.516Z)

the same what I provided.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:14.347Z)

Yeah. That's what they call ETL, extract transform.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:14.386Z)

Oh, yeah. I have to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:18.927Z)

And load. And, you know, the different all these different cloud services

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:21.706Z)

Yeah. So the one for Wagner. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:25.597Z)

has their own process the way I did when we didn't have a budget.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:26.116Z)

That we offer is answer Like, like, I Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:29.997Z)

We're just writing Python script and extract the data from

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:33.736Z)

Like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:33.837Z)

the Excel that you provided, Drew.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:34.216Z)

sorry. Go ahead.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:36.417Z)

And put it in the database. But that's not gonna work for the production level application.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:40.386Z)

Get on app with you.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:42.297Z)

Eventually have to use these

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:44.676Z)

We have a kind of a little bit one side here. But

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:46.867Z)

tools.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:47.676Z)

to extract the data from

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:49.327Z)

But I don't think that's gonna

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:50.036Z)

the data model.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:51.587Z)

cost us a lot, the detail process.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:52.686Z)

That provided for

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:54.537Z)

So it will be in the similar budget what I provided.

### You (2025-07-07T19:30:58.386Z)

Yeah. So we can't really think of

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:30:58.887Z)

Oh, yeah. That's gonna be something we talked to. I mean,

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:00.926Z)

my account and I were talking about

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:02.957Z)

the ETL process doesn't require

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:03.736Z)

is how that into it. Deal with

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:09.097Z)

Yeah. So, the one you provided, right, that is also very structured. Like, Right. I we we we yeah, we do structure.

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:19.486Z)

the p and l.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:22.127Z)

And I will have the, like, sorry. Go ahead. I'm reading directly from the documents loaded by the

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:26.616Z)

In two, three months time, whatever I said.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:30.377Z)

which we haven't done.

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:30.656Z)

That part.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:31.947Z)

Yet on the application. We'll see how to do that because

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:35.226Z)

From an operational and just perspective, like, what is the best way to do that?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:37.157Z)

we haven't kind of developed that functionality yet. But

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:39.326Z)

You know, if it's work with

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:41.107Z)

to extract the data from the

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:42.226Z)

broker or it's work with an operator or a couple of operators

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:44.617Z)

data model that you provided, Ruth. That was pretty straightforward because that was a restructure data.

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:49.296Z)

we get. Know? Props order somebody.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:51.147Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:51.916Z)

To Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:52.647Z)

Think that's one of the things that we

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:54.366Z)

Push.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:31:54.617Z)

Mark, Howard and I were talking about is how best to

### You (2025-07-07T19:31:55.106Z)

But more challenging for Do guys

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:00.607Z)

deal deal with getting data when we you know, when it's not

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:03.886Z)

Yeah. If

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:03.987Z)

from hotel BIS. Right? It's going to be

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:05.346Z)

if like, I

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:07.977Z)

you know, it may be in a p and l, so it may be

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:09.076Z)

just and I have to really But simply, like, the chief of staff from Hunter mortality

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:10.847Z)

sort of loosely structured, but the p and l that the operators produce aren't Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:16.096Z)

to work with us

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:16.297Z)

I'm not including

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:17.486Z)

to just test

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:18.047Z)

that in the MVP version in two, three months time, whatever I said. I haven't included that part.

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:18.646Z)

the data. Right? Like, pull up hotels with Better, listing for sale. See if we can adjust. It and get it

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:25.047Z)

Yeah. That's more for, I think, Diane, Mark, and I need to figure out just

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:25.196Z)

into our model. They redeemed parking hotels, so they're gonna be

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:29.087Z)

from an operational and business perspective, like, what is the best way to do that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:30.306Z)

simpler in some way. But they're also in the hotels that have

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:34.877Z)

Know, is it to work with a broker, or is it to work with an operator or a couple of operators?

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:35.886Z)

same fixed expenses Right? You know? Could be

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:39.697Z)

And, know, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:40.106Z)

harder. Some ways to upload

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:40.867Z)

or if we can get, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:42.206Z)

because they're not as professionally managed as some of the others.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:44.737Z)

profits order somebody to you know, then that that's obviously a

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:47.446Z)

One way to that or another way,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:48.457Z)

be huge. But but it's more challenging to work with those bigger companies because they're

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:52.356Z)

I think that is a more for me.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:54.117Z)

Drew, can I just run an idea by you and get your thoughts on it?

### You (2025-07-07T19:32:57.216Z)

To know from you know, hunters home.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:32:58.747Z)

Yeah. If if like and this this is just an I this is just an idea. Haven't really talked about

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:01.876Z)

Property. The Bay.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:05.277Z)

it with anyone. But say, like, the chief of staff from Hunter Hotels would be willing to work with us to just test

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:08.376Z)

Operators? They're dealing with. You know, like, you know, probably thinking we're coming here or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:13.357Z)

the data. Right? Like, pull up hotels that they're listing for sale and see if we could ingest

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:17.216Z)

know, each professional events

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:19.157Z)

it and get it into our model. They would be mid market hotels.

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:21.596Z)

you know.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:24.227Z)

They're gonna be simpler in some ways, but they're also probably the hotels that have missing fixed expenses. Right? And, you know, they they could be

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:32.616Z)

Three. So there might be a way to work through f3.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:34.757Z)

harder in some ways to upload because they're not as professionally managed

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:35.736Z)

On that. But yeah. Or someone in the CV, if they'll

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:39.727Z)

as some of the others. Do you have a reaction

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:41.686Z)

like, felt fantastic with us and some obviously something added to us.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:42.747Z)

one way to that or another? Like, I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:47.656Z)

Yeah. It's just

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:48.147Z)

Think I think that could work. I mean, I guess I'd be curious to know

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:50.706Z)

It's hard. It's hard to think it's, like, what's the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:53.277Z)

from, you know, Hunter's own

### You (2025-07-07T19:33:54.356Z)

like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:33:56.467Z)

pool of properties that they you know, that they're working on. You know, how many of like, who are the operators they're dealing with

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:04.326Z)

you know, just the testing pilot product or or whatever. We're

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:05.007Z)

You know, like, if they have know how many deal how many, you know, properties they they work on a year. Let's say it's a thousand. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:09.376Z)

We guess, we would just be that safe.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:11.627Z)

Are they, you know, 80% of them professionally managed by a third party operator.

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:16.606Z)

You know, underwriting.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:17.297Z)

You know, or are

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:18.386Z)

Pro formas if you

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:18.907Z)

Well, they're all Ahola hotels.

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:19.926Z)

revised

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:21.417Z)

So Okay. So You know? I know. So I mean, I think there could they're probably a lot of them are on m three. So there might be a way to, like, work their own three on that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:32.166Z)

Because I think if we could show people

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:32.377Z)

But Yeah. Better

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:36.146Z)

that we could say,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:37.347Z)

or or someone and see if they'll

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:37.356Z)

did a a test case with the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:40.757Z)

like, they'll test it with us and somehow release some data to us.

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:41.336Z)

and we were around the that. Right? Like, that might be a good

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:46.357Z)

Yeah. It's just yeah. It's hard it's hard because it's like, what's the

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:49.096Z)

stat. But, yeah, working with someone like a hunter who thinks they've heard a lot of

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:51.897Z)

like, if we were go if we were go to a Davidson,

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:53.996Z)

work. Just like you did. They're in the slot. We don't know what hotels. All we are doing

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:34:56.537Z)

then where do we go from there? Right? If Davidson says, sure. You can use our data for whatever.

### You (2025-07-07T19:34:58.826Z)

trying to adjust. We're actually doing evaluations. Right? So we could actually

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:02.977Z)

For your, you know, this this testing pilot product or or whatever,

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:06.126Z)

evaluation piece of it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:06.747Z)

Where do we go from where do we go from there? Do we

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:07.966Z)

But that's which is something after I know. But where do we do that?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:09.307Z)

I guess, it would just be back to Davidson to say, okay. We have your data in the system.

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:13.086Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:13.827Z)

And you can use it for you know, underwriting and pro formas and and refinance and

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:18.636Z)

Urgent discussion?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:20.047Z)

like that. Because Davidson wouldn't let us go out to a bunch of potential buyers

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:20.526Z)

Well, I think it's the three as I can help you out today, right,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:23.877Z)

Right? Like No. No. No. It would only need just to a test. Right? Internal exercise.

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:27.356Z)

you know, we can have our sort of record number

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:29.917Z)

Internal exercise to test.

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:30.656Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:32.397Z)

Because I think if we could show people

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:33.316Z)

We need to get we need to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:35.427Z)

we don't but we could say we did a

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:35.776Z)

develop that into a MVP that we can actually take out customers. But in the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:38.867Z)

a test case with Davidson, a test case with eight Cambridge, and we were

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:40.936Z)

biggest question mark for for an elevated MVP

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:43.237Z)

our validation rate was, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:45.376Z)

how we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:45.557Z)

I'm making a number up, 90% or something like that. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:46.806Z)

get data.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:48.937Z)

Like, that might be a good stat. But yet,

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:50.396Z)

But that's just not

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:52.407Z)

working with someone like a hunter, if they were to let us work

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:53.846Z)

Like, how do we get to a point where we're able to have the data? Like, we can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:55.897Z)

just like, again, blind. Their data's blind. We don't know what hotels.

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:58.206Z)

we can worry about that. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:35:59.397Z)

All we are doing is trying to ingest.

### You (2025-07-07T19:35:59.636Z)

we don't have have to all focus on that. Let's take step two. Step one is how do we get this advanced enough

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:03.187Z)

They're they're actually doing valuation.

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:06.306Z)

to be able to do that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:06.327Z)

Right? So we could actually test the valuation piece of it. But

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:09.646Z)

I don't gonna cost

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:11.147Z)

that's was just something I wanted to run by you guys.

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:12.246Z)

order to that's the question I I'm trying to understand. Like, what do we need

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:13.607Z)

But are we ready to do that? No. No. I More than But what is our path to getting there?

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:15.876Z)

to get from today into a point where we can get to judge the MVP. Once we have that in motion,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:19.727Z)

Like, isn't that the more urgent discussion?

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:22.716Z)

then we got a series

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:22.987Z)

Well, yeah, I think

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:24.066Z)

goals to figure it out. How to get the data. Right? But that's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:25.407Z)

it's the three of us. So aside from what we were talking about the other day, right,

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:27.256Z)

Yeah. Yeah. I think I think we have it until already. What what what like, I think we should

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:30.437Z)

you know, kinda have our

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:31.986Z)

focus on.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:32.087Z)

sort of rough road map for

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:32.556Z)

Step one first.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:34.227Z)

knowing where we need to go as far as we have a POC,

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:34.616Z)

Yeah. And I think we should close the loop.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:36.827Z)

We need to

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:37.276Z)

For it. We know that this is what we are doing.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:37.927Z)

get we we need to develop that into a MVP, right, that we can actually take out to customers. But I think the biggest question mark for for developing an MVP

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:47.676Z)

In

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:47.817Z)

is how are we going to get data?

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:48.696Z)

Or we are saying let's just get the data from portal b s to b s

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:51.507Z)

Yeah. But but that's we work in the business.

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:52.796Z)

an entire file of MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:54.747Z)

But that's isn't that that's the next like, we're skipping the first. Like, how do we get to a point?

### You (2025-07-07T19:36:54.786Z)

Yeah. I guess it's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:36:59.367Z)

Where we're able to test the data? Like, we could we could worry about that. Like, we don't know

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:02.086Z)

this mechanism for it. Important data more efficiently. Right? So it's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:04.337Z)

to all focus on that. That's, like, step two. Step one is

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:06.396Z)

integral to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:07.327Z)

how do we get this

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:07.796Z)

having a successful

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:09.087Z)

advanced enough to be able to do that?

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:09.196Z)

launch whether it's a year or a few days to be able to show

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:12.167Z)

That no. That's I think what is hang on one second. What is the cost in order to do that? That's the question I I'm trying to understand. Like like, what do we need

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:16.196Z)

again, we can just figure out what the economic cost is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:20.247Z)

to get from today into a point

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:22.016Z)

that we figure out how we're

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:23.327Z)

where we could begin to test the MVP? Once we have that in motion,

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:23.806Z)

raise the money for the music. That really needs know, do this. Right? So that's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:27.077Z)

then we can have a series of calls and figure out

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:28.106Z)

Yeah. Data in different words just from

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:29.287Z)

how to get the data. Right? But but that's Yeah. Well, I think I think we have it until we're ready.

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:32.936Z)

I mean, how we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:34.377Z)

What what why like, that I think that we should focus on

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:34.716Z)

want to do the data and just make it user uploaded to our platform.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:36.897Z)

step one first. Yeah. And I think we should close the loop wherein

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:39.476Z)

And then you know, we are ingesting that data into our database. Our RV

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:42.257Z)

we know that this is what we are developing on MVP.

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:44.816Z)

kind of

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:46.027Z)

Are we just developing the POC in MVP, or we are saying we have to develop

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:46.156Z)

interesting from any other sources. Via our own time or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:50.757Z)

the data ingestion in MVP, or we are saying we'll just

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:52.606Z)

whatever. So that also we need to discuss that. Yeah. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:54.797Z)

the data from hotel b BIS, and that will be part of MVP.

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:57.616Z)

I'll buy some API.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:37:58.917Z)

Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:37:59.166Z)

Yeah. Question, I think the cost

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:01.547Z)

A big part of what we're the big part of what we're trying to do for the industry, right, is to have this

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:06.656Z)

done.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:06.797Z)

mechanism for importing the data more efficiently. Right? So it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:07.836Z)

Right? But they end up to be able

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:10.087Z)

integral to having a successful

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:11.566Z)

you know, what this what they end up college. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:13.957Z)

launch. Whether it's POC or MVP, to be able to show people how this works and and again, if we could just figure out what the economic cost is, then we can figure out how to raise the money to give you the

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:27.496Z)

That but that that does not

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:29.687Z)

capital you need to, you know, do this. Right? So that's

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:30.466Z)

include how we get

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:32.657Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:33.076Z)

the data.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:33.447Z)

As far as data ingestion goes just from I mean, how we wanna do the data ingestion? Is it

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:41.386Z)

Provide

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:41.437Z)

user uploading to our platform?

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:42.516Z)

guidance on how we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:43.807Z)

You know, we are ingesting that data into our database.

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:43.866Z)

put that work. Right. So do do we go ahead with

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:48.037Z)

Or are we kind of

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:48.796Z)

taking

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:50.647Z)

ingesting from any other sources be that online or

### You (2025-07-07T19:38:56.356Z)

trying

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:38:57.007Z)

So that also we need to discuss that. Are we not getting it via some API? Mark, to answer your question, I think the cost you know, Vinod has outlined the cost of doing

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:07.556Z)

party. Just the so it for

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:08.787Z)

you know, what we have

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:09.766Z)

cost model

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:11.237Z)

done in the POC. Right? It's

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:11.406Z)

purposes, they will assume the worst case is that we have to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:13.377Z)

let's say, 10,000 I mean, looked at this, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:14.516Z)

buy and then we can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:16.397Z)

less than this. Let's say $10,000. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:16.506Z)

successfully borrow it or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:18.467Z)

Exclosing My point is, like, why are we guessing? Like, we should just

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:18.756Z)

get a friend that that's your Exactly.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:21.667Z)

try to come up with a spreadsheet. Well, I think, no. He Vinod did. Like, he he came he came up with a list of

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:23.086Z)

A lie. It's like

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:26.637Z)

the costs for the various things, how much it would cost per month. And the time it would take to get there. That but that's the thing is that that's that does not include

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:34.856Z)

for Excel model, that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:35.557Z)

how are we getting the data

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:36.656Z)

the to be able to.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:38.297Z)

from sources when it's not hotel BIS.

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:38.636Z)

Automate. Right? Hence,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:40.737Z)

Which is because that's a

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:41.816Z)

we do so by just having a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:42.067Z)

of a question mark from an operational perspective. Like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:44.136Z)

form that is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:45.167Z)

we haven't

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:45.866Z)

user

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:45.937Z)

provided

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:46.136Z)

opens up

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:46.687Z)

guidance on how we would want that to even work.

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:46.966Z)

and says, here's revenue she here. User doesn't she does

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:50.057Z)

So do we do we go ahead with

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:52.986Z)

and they

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:53.337Z)

taking doing what we have and starting to

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:56.646Z)

done.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:39:56.687Z)

try to develop that get get the money to the to an MVP.

### You (2025-07-07T19:39:57.166Z)

And now somebody has typed it. The next what would be done or advance that would be

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:01.337Z)

Or do we need to figure out the data ingestion process I mean, if if if we didn't have sort of friends in the industry, could we just buy it from a

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:07.876Z)

they're different. Right? You know,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:12.037Z)

a third party? Just just the so if for

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:13.856Z)

100, know,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:15.257Z)

cost modeling purposes,

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:17.136Z)

for

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:17.827Z)

maybe we assume the worst case that we have to buy it,

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:19.586Z)

So was

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:20.407Z)

And then if we can successfully

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:20.816Z)

to how we wanna do this set of work.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:23.087Z)

borrow it or get it from a friend, then that's just money that we're saving. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:24.176Z)

Yeah. I think so. I think could certainly option.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:26.807Z)

It's not I mean, it's not so much stuff we can buy. It's like when you buy when you

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:27.466Z)

Thank you. Right. You know?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:30.587Z)

are gonna buy a hotel and you go you know, a broker puts up

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:30.746Z)

As quickly as we can. We still have

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:33.757Z)

you know, data on the website you know, on the the deal room and you download it,

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:34.506Z)

Yeah. Yep. They can do that. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:37.277Z)

and somebody takes the p and l from the data room and hard codes it into an Excel model,

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:39.576Z)

Decision. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:41.287Z)

that's the the process we need to be able to automate. Right? Right. And may maybe if maybe we do so by just

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:48.106Z)

Scenes.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:48.987Z)

having a form that a user

### You (2025-07-07T19:40:51.336Z)

No

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:40:51.627Z)

opens up and says, here is revenues, here is expenses, here is all the line items for all the different years. They type it all in, and then they submit it. That's that would be the easiest way, probably. Right? And then it's done. And that somebody has to type it in. The next level, you know, more advanced than that would be

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:05.906Z)

your

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:07.637Z)

somebody submits a PNL or a series of PNLs,

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:08.696Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:10.717Z)

but then we would have to tell the system how to read

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:12.776Z)

To get the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:13.637Z)

those PNLs because they're all different. Right? You know, every every operator's PNL is a little

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:14.296Z)

and then can figure out. That. To do it the right way. You know, over time.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:17.947Z)

different. So that would be using automation. Could we could we hard input the first couple just for

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:20.936Z)

Time. Outside

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:23.017Z)

illustrative purposes? And then that'll give us another month to

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:23.666Z)

then they'll come to know that this is not clear.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:26.977Z)

figure out how we wanna do this in a more efficient way. Yeah. I think I think we could. That's certainly an option. Again, I'm just trying to you know, how do we get to the the path

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:34.476Z)

Purposes.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:36.307Z)

quickly as we can but still have an impactful demonstration to users?

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:36.556Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Just try to to Steve.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:39.907Z)

Yeah. Yep. We we can do that. Yeah. The advantage

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:42.106Z)

So much.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:43.387Z)

I guess, advantage of of the of

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:45.156Z)

What the delta is?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:46.877Z)

not automating that now

### You (2025-07-07T19:41:47.526Z)

Wanna adjust? Data.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:41:49.927Z)

is that it's very behind the scenes. Like, nobody sees it. Right? So if you save the automation for the end, no one's gonna be the wiser. As long as you don't get yourself don't be as long as we don't become that, that self driving truck company where they found out that no one was actually behind the wheel. I remember last year. Two years ago, it was a scandal. They showed this anyway, never mind.

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:10.626Z)

Do.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:11.677Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. As long as you don't like Yeah. Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:12.446Z)

Say the supplement.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:15.107Z)

But, yeah, I mean, maybe we have to fake it for the first one or two just to get the data in the system.

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:15.646Z)

But I I say it's hotels coming directly

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:19.837Z)

And then we can figure out how to it the right way.

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:22.426Z)

have a big map.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:22.777Z)

You know, over time. But then we are giving the capabilities to

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:25.056Z)

The other way is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:26.767Z)

outside user to use our platform, then they'll come to know that this is

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:26.776Z)

you have to has to do

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:31.427Z)

not real.

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:32.086Z)

drop.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:32.447Z)

Yes. I'm you have to buy I think we have to be honest with them and tell them that we just

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:34.106Z)

Into a central I

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:37.267Z)

hard inputted this just for

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:37.606Z)

so to draw all of that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:38.877Z)

the initial purposes, but that we have a plan. Yeah. And, yeah, I'm I'm just trying to see if we there a way, though? And and, Vinod, thank you so much for doing those estimates

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:48.756Z)

in

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:49.127Z)

But is there a way we can understand what the delta is if we did wanna just act

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:51.186Z)

forecast. Yes.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:54.097Z)

the data ingestion piece of it. Like, if it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:42:54.956Z)

Yeah. That the last week

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:42:57.657Z)

It's just the time line, really. Not the cost of infrastructure, but the time line of the delivery.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:00.876Z)

with that is that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:02.627Z)

Well, it's but it's often we have to tell the node what we want.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:04.146Z)

the the p and l was

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:06.147Z)

Like, saying data ingestion doesn't mean anything. There's a million ways to do that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:07.086Z)

are not

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:11.027Z)

So we have to be we have to be very specific about what

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:12.476Z)

data

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:14.197Z)

you know, what what are we asking him to build.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:15.416Z)

data

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:16.777Z)

Got it. So if I were to say,

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:17.266Z)

for every property. That is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:19.027Z)

I'm just gonna make this up for a minute, but if I were to say we could get Davidson to test

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:19.536Z)

you know. Onto it. Itself. But if somebody screws up, ground, they've gotta never get out.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:23.997Z)

x amount of hotels coming directly through BIS because you already have

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:25.606Z)

Different. Screws

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:28.397Z)

it mapped. And then the other way, is you have a user that has to do it the old RedeyeQ way, where

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:32.586Z)

chokey.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:35.737Z)

the way RedIQ did it, which is drop p and l's and stars into a central

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:40.016Z)

First

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:41.327Z)

box. I'm the seller. Right? So I have to drop all of that into a box.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:45.676Z)

and

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:46.237Z)

And then it instantaneously, if I can say that word, populates

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:47.786Z)

put the input what's revenue, what's expenses, where does it go? Right? So it's sort of

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:51.207Z)

the historical, the star, the forecast,

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:52.606Z)

like

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:54.497Z)

in the InnVestAI model.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:54.896Z)

a trade off. Right? Like, Yeah. It's, you know, it's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:57.287Z)

Those would be the two ways.

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:57.566Z)

So we don't have a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:43:58.827Z)

Yeah. And I think that the latter way that you

### You (2025-07-07T19:43:59.026Z)

put a lot of resources to develop.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:02.807Z)

mentioned, right, having somebody drop in files the challenge with that is that the the p and l's that the operators produce are not consistent. The same. Right? Right. Right. Like, I mean, Davidson has like, if Davidson runs

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:16.846Z)

Possible. Faster than we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:19.227Z)

if they use the same parameters and they run the same PNL,

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:19.246Z)

way. To

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:22.957Z)

for every property, that is consistent, you know, unto itself.

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:25.886Z)

six months.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:26.927Z)

But if somebody screws up the parameters or they run a different p and l, it's gonna look different.

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:29.476Z)

Point out like, some various ways in which we can get data, you know, we can

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:32.127Z)

The system won't recognize it. If you if you then wanna if you wanna load HEI PNLs or

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:33.806Z)

talk about this And you know, how we can apply on that as well.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:38.257Z)

Schulte or Hersha or any other operator, every single one becomes different.

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:39.896Z)

You know, cost to time. Perspective.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:42.527Z)

So

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:42.706Z)

The the challenge here

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:43.317Z)

because then you unless you unless you start to use AI to take

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:44.296Z)

not technology. It's it's a business process. It's an operational process.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:47.857Z)

to try to, like, figure out those differences and

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:50.666Z)

Somebody

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:52.307Z)

and

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:52.476Z)

getting somebody. Prophetor,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:53.837Z)

put the date put, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:44:54.106Z)

to to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:44:55.127Z)

what's revenue, what's expenses, where does it go. Right? So it's sort of like a it's a trade off. Right? Like, and and and

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:03.116Z)

Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:03.857Z)

we don't have the you know, a lot of resources to develop. But it but for the MVP, if we

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:06.176Z)

To us. Right? For people

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:08.197Z)

could at least just get to I mean, gosh. Even if it's one operator and we

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:08.466Z)

operator on p and l. People their super

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:13.137Z)

upload Davidson's through BIS, and then we drop the Davidson p

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:16.746Z)

get up.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:17.777Z)

calls into a box and upload it that way, we're at least showing investors that we have a way ingest the data. It just needs to be worked on. Right? It needs to be and that's what we'll do over the next six months. Am I am I May maybe I should I can write out, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:32.846Z)

Thank you. For us.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:36.227Z)

some various ways in which we could get data, and we can talk about them.

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:36.346Z)

People.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:40.567Z)

And the node and Howard can opine on them as well from a, you know, cost and timing perspective.

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:44.686Z)

Consent form.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:47.807Z)

Right. The challenge here is not technology. It's it's a business process. It's an operational process.

### You (2025-07-07T19:45:53.906Z)

Of certain caliber. Right? Like, did he

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:45:55.817Z)

Getting somebody either getting somebody like profits or to to release

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:02.236Z)

with

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:03.337Z)

which is a that's a legal challenge. Right? Not not a technical one. It's super easy if we get the legal permission.

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:08.866Z)

to you that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:10.067Z)

Right? Or getting an operator to release data to us. Right?

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:10.716Z)

Value that doing

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:14.167Z)

Or people to put p and ls in operation, something. They are not super easy from a technology perspective. The challenge is figuring out

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:21.966Z)

for some of their customers. With us.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:23.617Z)

operationally how are we gonna, you know, what's gonna work. Right? What's the and that's what I was talking about. The path of least resistance to to make it work either for a small subset of people that we're gonna test it with or for a broad sub you know, a broader subset of people

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:39.226Z)

Deal with third parties.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:42.037Z)

that, you know, we're gonna test it with. If we just do use even

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:43.236Z)

And help walk 20 or 30 or 50.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:46.227Z)

even if they wanted to work with us, do they have the ability to, or do they have agreements with their clients

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:47.606Z)

To go out. For the same. Thing.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:51.197Z)

saying, they won't share data

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:51.856Z)

With, I think, third party

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:53.287Z)

without specific authorization?

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:53.676Z)

than than three.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:55.727Z)

They certainly have agreements

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:56.046Z)

I need a hotel chair. I have tech.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:46:57.947Z)

that with their data that you know, with their customers, they're saying they're not going to share data

### You (2025-07-07T19:46:58.736Z)

With colleagues

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:02.177Z)

with anybody that's not of a certain caliber. Right? Like, that meets a threshold of an affiliate or a partner

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:05.436Z)

every day.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:10.097Z)

something like that.

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:10.546Z)

Great. But

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:11.377Z)

Which

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:12.006Z)

they have to sit through the one that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:12.547Z)

we could

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:13.596Z)

really are gonna present value

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:14.237Z)

easily become that, but we'd have to demonstrate to them that

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:16.956Z)

one

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:17.577Z)

we're worthy of that. Like, that that there's value to them in doing it, which is what I mean, again, like, Hotel BIS is like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:23.936Z)

I mean, if you were

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:24.427Z)

probably I'm hoping, you know, knock on wood. This week, we signed the the the proof of concepts documentation with them that they're gonna start sharing data.

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:29.206Z)

like, in the case you're talking about, probably, date.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:31.707Z)

For some of their customers with us on a whole scale. M three? Like, how

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:32.266Z)

Said rightly,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:35.807Z)

Because you talked about m three as well. And I'm just curious, could we approach m three a

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:37.236Z)

access to to telephone.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:40.417Z)

with a sim especially since Blackstone has invested in them? Like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:40.546Z)

For the If wanna do that. Then

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:44.467Z)

I could just see their eyes light up if they saw a I've tried m three doesn't deal with third parties, so you have to get a customer to go ask.

### You (2025-07-07T19:47:51.176Z)

how that structure

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:47:52.887Z)

And not one is not gonna do it. You have to get, like, 20 or 30 or 50. To go ask for the same thing. Is much more willing to work with with, I think, third parties. Than than m three. I mean, Hotelier and AppTek, again, would probably be willing to

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:07.366Z)

But

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:09.627Z)

work with us on that. But, again, it's more of I'm like again, I think of it from their perspective. They probably get approached

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:10.276Z)

soar.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:14.607Z)

you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:14.726Z)

Way.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:15.207Z)

every day by a different group saying we have this great idea. And Mhmm. I'm sure they are all great.

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:19.956Z)

Easter

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:21.137Z)

But they have to sift through the ones that really are going to present value and

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:23.196Z)

was Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:25.837Z)

also are gonna because it's it's not just

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:27.756Z)

That. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:28.627Z)

takes time to resources on their end too. So But if you got the thing with ProfitSword, I mean, if you were to secure, that would be huge.

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:30.956Z)

Happen,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:35.707Z)

Right? Because then And it would be yeah. And I think like, in the case you're talking about with with Davidson. Right? Like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:39.986Z)

that help. Projections that. Like, over the next three, six months.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:48:42.517Z)

we go to Davidson and say, like, let us you know, give us access to to tell profits or to work with us. For this limited use case. If they were to do that, then we could use the API to pull data from for any and all profit or hotel.

### You (2025-07-07T19:48:59.446Z)

The meeting, you know.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:00.257Z)

And that would that's structured. It's very easy. It's like you just

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:02.516Z)

Safe.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:03.277Z)

pull the API. And you have Davidson hotels. Right? Any Davidson hotels. Same hotels.

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:04.436Z)

Get data or tell them that you're trying to underwrite.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:07.497Z)

And that can either done by us, Hotel BIS, or could be done directly by InnVestAI. Either way, it's pretty easy. It's just a low it's a low cost thing to do.

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:17.096Z)

Is what

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:17.147Z)

If we're secure that agreement with ProfitSword,

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:18.166Z)

So we have to have to do. Some sort of problem. So that

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:20.827Z)

and we paper it some way, then from the profit sword level, they're abiding by what they've agreed to with their customers. Right? Because they're dealing with a certain however you explained it.

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:29.696Z)

people True.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:31.977Z)

Partnership or something like that. Right? Yeah. Right. This isn't this isn't gonna happen, like, overnight. Right? Right. So, like, in the for the next six months while we work on developing the MVP,

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:41.276Z)

So can I ask real quick? Other than

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:43.787Z)

the the functionality that we have in the POC with

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:44.236Z)

financial statement, what else would a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:46.887Z)

putting in your projections, etcetera, all that, like,

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:48.036Z)

investor or a broker need to upload

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:49.787Z)

that's gonna get developed into the MVP over the next three to six months.

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:52.076Z)

into the system in order to create a model?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:49:53.377Z)

What do we do, you know, as far as, like, getting the data What's the what's the most effective and scalable way to get data?

### You (2025-07-07T19:49:57.936Z)

Well yeah. But I think we have to that's a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:02.077Z)

That part you know, as part that's going to be in the MVP? Because I think

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:03.306Z)

it's all. So it's very

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:05.917Z)

we don't wanna go to we don't wanna finish the MVP and all the functionality, and then we start to go to customers.

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:10.186Z)

Right. Right.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:12.397Z)

Say, don't have a way to get data for hotels that you're trying to underwrite.

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:14.116Z)

Okay. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:16.357Z)

But then it has to be the Dropbox. Right? It just it has to be because, I mean, Red IQ did it, and and I realized multifamily

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:20.986Z)

from Mark. Or

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:23.357Z)

is simpler, but in some ways, we are more structured in our data as well.

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:24.036Z)

ticket. Like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:27.697Z)

So wouldn't we have to I mean, I I think we're gonna have to do some sort of drop

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:28.876Z)

you know, you can apply everybody. And

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:31.677Z)

eventually because the world isn't quite yet set to

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:32.786Z)

You know, you he's

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:35.807Z)

transfer data digitally, and there will be people that will will will need to traverse or progress through that. You know, people will drop the data in a box, and then we'll, three months later, make progress

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:46.166Z)

It's really

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:47.217Z)

with m three and profits or does this make sense? Like Yeah. I yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:50:49.756Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:50:51.167Z)

I mean, Mhmm. Star. Well, yeah. I mean, STR.

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:08.526Z)

Does that mean? Sense? Like, so

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:10.007Z)

I think that's a

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:10.306Z)

repeat that literally to

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:11.327Z)

that's a one size fits all. So it's

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:11.626Z)

you. The one. To keep 16 item.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:14.217Z)

it's very it's not

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:14.536Z)

Summary.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:16.127Z)

once you do it for you know, it's the same for everybody.

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:16.556Z)

That would

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:18.627Z)

So it's it's really just financial statements. Right? And

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:21.046Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:21.997Z)

and the financial data that goes with it.

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:22.646Z)

System set up to read,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:23.897Z)

That way, also, are also market data. Right? Because you need to project growth and

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:23.926Z)

but it would be

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:27.877Z)

Well, I think in market data, again, we can get you know, from Lark or Hotel Horizons. Right? Those are it's getting more similar to STR. It's like one size fits all. You get it once. It'll know, you can apply it to everybody. And

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:40.616Z)

and

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:41.467Z)

Ryan Mellicker, you know, he's he's he and I talked a lot about working together he's willing to share data in a structured format that we could just load once a quarter every time he comes out with a new forecast. So that's so it's market data is easy.

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:50.016Z)

for a lot. Of. And so

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:54.127Z)

SDR data is fairly easy.

### You (2025-07-07T19:51:55.096Z)

so

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:51:56.297Z)

It's really the financial data, the revenues, expenses for the property that are difficult. And, Drew, if we kept it to the summary p and l for the MVP,

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:02.296Z)

directed over. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:04.587Z)

The summary p and l's aren't that different. Right? The only difference really is need

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:04.896Z)

yeah, I think think right now, but it's just to clearly illustrate. Right? Like, this is the API.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:08.777Z)

how certain revenue management items are

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:11.026Z)

You know. They all

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:11.817Z)

calculated. But even then, if I'm underwriting, I might

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:14.836Z)

for every hotel.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:15.677Z)

be making those adjustments unless I'm changing brands.

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:15.826Z)

Everything. Please.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:18.427Z)

That make sense? Like, so if we were to keep it literally to

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:21.666Z)

I

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:21.957Z)

the, what, 15, 16 items on the summary p and l,

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:24.076Z)

tell the system if

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:26.117Z)

that would be doable.

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:26.176Z)

a p and l from AGI. And

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:28.487Z)

It would be yeah. If you have the system set up to read like, here let me just I'll show you, like, a

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:34.396Z)

then this is

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:35.707Z)

The other way to do it is to go

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:37.286Z)

a of of and

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:39.597Z)

to the brand to get the information. Well, brands don't have a financial

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:41.846Z)

row. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:44.087Z)

right, except for the properties that they

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:44.936Z)

And

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:46.147Z)

operate. Yeah. But even if even if they're getting a franchise fee, they have statements.

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:48.076Z)

put them. And then from the

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:51.567Z)

But I will say that CB's benchmarker, even if we could pull it off,

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:54.696Z)

Yes. So it but right now,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:52:58.717Z)

they're getting the full p and l's for

### You (2025-07-07T19:52:59.346Z)

the more true to you. And it will be work

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:02.217Z)

a lot of hotels. And so, mean, if I don't think it's a tomorrow thing, but it is something we could try to work on over the next six months. Yeah. I think the Calibri Lab also gets their data directly from the brands. So I think it's gonna be something we have to work on. I don't think we're gonna come up with a solution right now, but it just to clearly illustrate

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:19.866Z)

they

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:20.997Z)

Right? Like, this is an HEI p and l.

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:21.036Z)

well, because

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:23.077Z)

They all AGI can produce this P and L

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:23.696Z)

Right? So they don't have

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:26.337Z)

for every hotel.

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:27.046Z)

so we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:27.397Z)

Very easily. It's it's it's a standardized thing from HEI. And

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:29.956Z)

Yeah. But When we talk

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:30.537Z)

I mean, if I know it, Howard, correct me if I'm wrong, but I what I think would have to happen is we would have

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:33.086Z)

my Dragon you know.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:35.507Z)

tell the system this is a p and l from HEI.

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:37.076Z)

How do we

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:39.907Z)

And if you see if if a user submits a p and l,

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:41.376Z)

just a matter of, like, getting access

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:43.617Z)

and they say it's from HEI,

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:44.036Z)

each, you know, and training

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:45.977Z)

then the system will know, okay. Row 17 is room's revenue.

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:46.396Z)

them. To read it. The So Yeah. Yeah. Yes and no.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:49.337Z)

18 is F and B. Nine right? And it will be able to read every single row

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:52.256Z)

It is easiest

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:53.927Z)

This is the summary p and l.

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:54.136Z)

if we can do that. And sounds to me like maybe when we start off

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:55.657Z)

Right? And it can put and then it we can say, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:53:58.316Z)

that that's that's a good plan to do it. Right? If we just

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:53:59.657Z)

put that data in the corresponding location in the data model.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:01.336Z)

have a client like HEI that has a standardized format,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:03.057Z)

And then from the data model, you can pull it into the interface.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:05.616Z)

let's go for it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:06.407Z)

So if if yeah. So

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:07.546Z)

With red IQ, we did it

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:08.657Z)

but if somebody

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:09.756Z)

more based on these origination

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:09.837Z)

right. That only works for AGI, and it only works for this for this p and l.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:13.386Z)

of the software.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:14.457Z)

And if we wanna do Davidson, we have to do the same thing for a Davidson p and l.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:15.786Z)

So we had a RealPage template. We had a Yardy template.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:19.277Z)

The same thing for a Hersha p and l, the same

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:19.616Z)

And and all these different property management systems.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:21.917Z)

know, eventually, you mean, again, like, we have 50 operators we're working with right now, and we have a different process with every single one.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:24.516Z)

The problem when you have a template based system is one little change can break it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:28.257Z)

And we don't use these p and l's because

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:30.656Z)

Right? So Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:31.527Z)

they well, because they don't have all the detail. Right? So

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:33.296Z)

If they change the spelling or if they insert a new row

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:36.397Z)

and they don't have account numbers.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:37.576Z)

or anything like that. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:38.737Z)

So we we prefer to use, like, more like a trial balance.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:41.176Z)

what we're describing here, I think, is adequate

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:41.857Z)

But what you're talking about, Diane, is, like, if you wanna drag and drop

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:43.796Z)

for the MVP.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:46.087Z)

a P and L, that's what you have. You have to tell the system to, like, how to read

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:46.336Z)

And especially if we can identify somebody

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:49.857Z)

each individual one.

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:50.436Z)

early on in the process, that we can create a

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:51.317Z)

Which is, I mean, totally doable. It's just a matter of, like, getting access to each p and l,

### You (2025-07-07T19:54:54.766Z)

That's that's great. Where we want to be is where you mentioned, Drew, earlier,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:54:57.037Z)

and training the system to read it. The

### You (2025-07-07T19:55:00.576Z)

using AI and machine learning. So instead of looking for I need this item in this column on this row you're you're basically looking and you're scanning down. All you need to do is you have to identify periods across, identify the descriptors down on the the titles, and then you could also create when you use AI, you can say, yeah. I I need I need my rooms rent. Or it might also be called room rent or and then you start adding

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:55:40.287Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:55:40.386Z)

some other items in there to account for potential variations in the name. You know, multifamily is famous for that. There's probably 50 different combinations of of things in the other income. Pet fees, pet rent, you know, all these different things. They're the same thing, but each individual client could have a different name in it. But when you approach it that way, and and we this is what we're going about in what I've been working on is that master chart of accounts, really, which is the which would be the InnVest way, which would be identical to what you've got already. And then what we want to do is just we can identify specific variations of those names. And and it's pretty simple to upload a document and it goes down and looks at these descriptors and says, oh, pet rent. You know, that matches our pet fees in our and so it will map everything that way. I don't think either one of those is going to have or or be a roadblock. To to get this set up. So especially if we go with Diane's suggestion of starting off with summary level. Because remember in the in the model that I put together so far, you know, I'm not breaking down food and beverage into the cat subcategories and then the individual line items.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:57:12.227Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T19:57:14.736Z)

We're we wanna get there. But at least for the MVP, we can just say, food and beverage is food and beverage. You know, if you've got it broken down, we will roll it up into that main category. Okay. Too. Take I know. Put together as far as the budget. Into and something else so we can get We can how long it's gonna take after something really I think there's two areas. Where want to invest again further. The execution process. If any So said it's really it's not a matter of the cost. It's a matter of the time. Right? So did did I get that right? So expecting from some breakup on the might be easier than expecting it from the time of, like,

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:40.047Z)

Okay. So maybe the best way to proceed here is to

### You (2025-07-07T19:58:44.546Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:45.497Z)

take what Vinod, what you put together as far as the budget

### You (2025-07-07T19:58:45.526Z)

Okay. Sorry to keep going. I mean, I don't know you I just wanna jump on her.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:49.867Z)

start to put that into something in Excel, something we can

### You (2025-07-07T19:58:53.486Z)

Okay. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:54.287Z)

we can

### You (2025-07-07T19:58:54.566Z)

I start to break this down in more detail.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:55.787Z)

expand on the lines and expand on the columns

### You (2025-07-07T19:58:59.476Z)

Our

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:58:59.527Z)

you know, columns being, you know, month by month, how long it's gonna take. And we can add in something I think sounds like there's two areas where we want to investigate further. It's the ingestion, you know, the data loading process.

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:12.666Z)

to useful to. Know, potential

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:15.277Z)

And

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:16.216Z)

potential

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:16.737Z)

any any utilization of AI.

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:17.046Z)

first customer

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:20.547Z)

So and can I stop in here and ask a question? And that is, Vinod, if I think I heard you right, you said it's really it's not a matter of the cost. It's a matter of the time. Right? So did I get that right? So

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:34.346Z)

like, letter.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:35.147Z)

Yeah. For the ingestion process. Right? Whether we are getting from hotel BIS or we are extracting it from the documents, If it you know, if we are just, extracting

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:44.336Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:47.157Z)

extracting from the summary document, that might be easier than, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T19:59:47.936Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T19:59:51.667Z)

extracting it from the entire document. That's what I meant. Okay. So sorry, Drew. Keep going. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just wanted to make sure I understood that.

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:00.016Z)

So yeah. Anyway can start with that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:02.367Z)

Yeah. Cost wise, it would be similar. Yep. Okay. So let's start to break this out in more detail. Howard excuse me. Mark Van, we can talk

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:13.396Z)

Exciting.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:14.317Z)

separately more about

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:14.676Z)

Getting there.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:16.807Z)

what's the operational process we think is going to be the most acceptable to and useful to, I guess, you know, potential potential first customers.

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:29.766Z)

I vote for another call later in the end of the week because I think we really

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:31.757Z)

Because that that doesn't need to be right. Like, we can continue to work on

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:34.316Z)

need to get the numbers from

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:34.777Z)

on figuring out the operational process even while the rest of the MVP is in is in process.

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:35.696Z)

Vinod and what we need to to to what we need to proceed.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:39.947Z)

Right. Because remember again, what we're looking for are people

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:41.026Z)

Okay. So, Diane, like you and I talked about today, just for everybody else's clarification,

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:43.207Z)

who will say if it gets to a certain point, they'll use it, like letters, right, that

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:46.006Z)

the POC

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:47.457Z)

say that the product could be useful if it had x, y, and z. And and

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:48.886Z)

is just the five of us.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:50.987Z)

we are gonna have to go seek some funding. So

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:51.166Z)

Internally, looking at it, making sure it works, the MVP

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:54.947Z)

I I I mean Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T20:00:57.066Z)

is when we go out to external clients for beta

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:00:57.977Z)

That's probably a good place to leave it. Right? Yeah. But we have a we again, Vinod did put together some some high level

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:01.106Z)

not even do it. We do the POC today.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:04.307Z)

estimates on on the funding.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:04.986Z)

Right? That's that's what I'm working on.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:06.467Z)

You know,

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:07.216Z)

With with the tools.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:07.627Z)

month by month for the next few months. So

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:08.956Z)

But in order for us to have external users be able to log in

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:11.277Z)

yeah, I think we we can start with that.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:13.626Z)

in upload, and work on an actual deal

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:16.347Z)

But, Howard, let's end on a really good note. The value piece. It's a

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:17.246Z)

that has to be the MVP and that has to

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:20.417Z)

exciting to see it come together like that. It's like, woo. We're getting down to the like, almost

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:21.476Z)

use the things that the node needs, the database, the the authentication

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:24.787Z)

the bottom line. It's exciting. Getting there.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:25.876Z)

all of these things for external users. So that's where we have to divide

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:27.427Z)

Getting there.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:30.846Z)

or or make that that that division.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:31.387Z)

Alright, everyone.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:33.216Z)

Is it'd be the difference between our

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:33.707Z)

Do we wanna talk another time this week, or are we good with this one time this week? What's

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:35.806Z)

the five of us working on the POC and then

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:38.317Z)

the consensus?

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:38.426Z)

going out to external users for the MVP. Yeah. So Right. So, yeah, I think in order to make a better decision and get a timeline, Vinod and I are gonna be meeting here in another hour or so. We'll we'll talk about that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:01:53.927Z)

Okay.

### You (2025-07-07T20:01:56.186Z)

And then we if we can circle back again Thursday or Friday, we can kinda go through those numbers and then start to to Mark's point. We got a nail down a timeline. Have to we have to make a decision here. How much money do we need? How long is it gonna take? And and then go from there. Great. Yeah. Yes. Perfect. I'll send it right now. I quickly wanted to understand what to the use case like, huge testing fund between them.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:02:55.107Z)

Yeah. Right.

### You (2025-07-07T20:02:58.356Z)

The you know, funding the goods. While doing everything. Actually, we can get enough money to be in a like, we can get some money to do develop the MVP if we can do that. Amongst ourselves or from, you know, people that don't need to see anything more? More. Can only see the POC, then can do the best. Right? Then we can start we can work out you know, get we can get and work on the

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:26.477Z)

Great. So Thursday at noon eastern, does that work for everyone?

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:27.396Z)

FPP that way. I think that's the sort of for an option.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:29.987Z)

Sure.

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:31.146Z)

I think we we

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:32.327Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:32.346Z)

don't want it. Take a

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:34.107Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:35.266Z)

and try to use it as a.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:35.567Z)

Perfect. I'll send the invite out.

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:37.296Z)

Tool. Right?

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:41.137Z)

I quickly wanted to understand, like, what

### You (2025-07-07T20:03:43.166Z)

That we want. So

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:03:46.197Z)

the use case for MVP is to kind of show to the external like, users or testing or fundraising, or what is the purpose of doing MVP? Are we focusing on the most important feature of

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:01.976Z)

itself. Idea about you have to then I think you can

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:05.247Z)

application which we could

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:05.956Z)

in

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:06.627Z)

eventually cross sell to the potential buyers or

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:07.706Z)

it's it's the goal of of what

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:10.557Z)

get the, you know, funding or what's

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:10.736Z)

customers are going to to to

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:14.937Z)

are we doing MVP at all?

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:15.386Z)

Right? Because you can see

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:16.507Z)

If we can get

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:16.606Z)

play with it. Interact with it.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:19.867Z)

enough money to, you know, like,

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:21.486Z)

And that does that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:23.117Z)

we need to get some money, basically, to develop the MVP. If we can do that,

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:26.286Z)

Stay.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:26.997Z)

amongst ourselves or from, you know,

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:27.386Z)

So yeah. So, like, I think I'm kinda buying

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:30.747Z)

that don't need to see anything more or or can only see the POC,

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:31.026Z)

we focus time on this interface so far. It ended up at eight process.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:35.717Z)

then we could do that.

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:36.766Z)

Right? I mean,

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:37.187Z)

Right? Then we can start we can work on

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:38.586Z)

we can use

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:39.057Z)

you know, get what we get, get and work on the MVP that way.

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:39.276Z)

just that hotel via

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:42.117Z)

I think that's the sort of preferred option. I think we we don't wanna

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:45.306Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:46.867Z)

take the POC and try to use it as a fundraising tool.

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:47.756Z)

that's kind of next next piece. So of it's more of your

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:51.837Z)

Right? Right now. I mean, is is that the most

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:55.636Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:56.117Z)

crucial feature that we want to

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:56.326Z)

Yeah. Yeah. So so Vinod

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:04:58.077Z)

show to our, you know, buyers or

### You (2025-07-07T20:04:58.816Z)

more specific The proof of concept, we could

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:02.367Z)

investors or The interface to me?

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:02.646Z)

meet with a potential user tomorrow.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:05.117Z)

Like I mean, the POCP that we have already put together, is that the functionality

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:05.816Z)

And do a demo. Right? So we could show somebody, here's what we've got.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:09.497Z)

which is most crucial or sellable

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:12.386Z)

Here's the layout. Start here at

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:12.967Z)

That's what I want to understand from your perspective because I don't have idea about the market and

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:15.406Z)

blah blah blah. You know, kinda go down the list.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:17.937Z)

I think it's it's the most

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:18.486Z)

Use the PowerPoint to fill in the gaps. You know, here's the things that we're

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:20.487Z)

visible part of of what

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:22.586Z)

we have coming up.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:24.557Z)

customers are going to

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:26.396Z)

In order for the external users

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:26.597Z)

to to appreciate. Because you can see it. You can play with it. You can interact with it.

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:29.416Z)

to actually start doing beta testing, and

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:32.117Z)

The process the other part of it is

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:32.486Z)

inputting data themselves, that's the MVP in

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:34.057Z)

the data loading part of it, and that

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:35.596Z)

and and that's really where we need to get.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:35.727Z)

doesn't have you know, there's not much interaction there. It's sort of just does its thing.

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:40.696Z)

K.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:41.467Z)

So

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:42.646Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:42.787Z)

yeah. So that's I think that's kind of why we focused the time on this interface so far.

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:45.886Z)

Alright. Sounds good. Thank you. You.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:48.447Z)

But and then that data loading process

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:48.586Z)

You. You. I'm trying to do do it in a

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:50.807Z)

Right? I mean, if if we can use data from Hotel BIS,

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:51.476Z)

in in the team. Space. It's not with, like, a floating Excel file.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:55.057Z)

to begin with,

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:55.656Z)

If I can't get through

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:56.067Z)

but that's a very small subset.

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:56.986Z)

work, I'll do that.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:05:58.217Z)

So I think

### You (2025-07-07T20:05:58.796Z)

Alright. Alright. Cool.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:06:01.047Z)

that's kind of the next

### You (2025-07-07T20:06:02.066Z)

Yeah. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:06:02.887Z)

the next piece. But

### You (2025-07-07T20:06:03.276Z)

Thanks. Thanks, buddy.

### Guest (2025-07-07T20:06:04.357Z)

takes more figuring out on. Yeah. As far as we all are on the same page, then we are good. Yep. No. Well, sounds good. Yeah. Alright. I'll I'll together something that we can I'm trying to do it to in a in in the Teams thing, so it's not, like, just, like, a floating Excel file. But if I can't get something to work, then I'll do it in just Excel, and we'll share it there. Yeah. Alright. Thanks. Thank you.
