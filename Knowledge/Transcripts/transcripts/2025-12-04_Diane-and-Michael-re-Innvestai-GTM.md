# Transcript for: Diane and Michael re: Innvestai GTM

### You (2025-12-04T18:01:30.018Z)

From there. Prior. Prior to here, we were in Jackson. So much closer to Ann Arbor. I used to. I had an office in Antarctica, short period of time.

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:01:43.536Z)

How far are you from Holland?

### You (2025-12-04T18:01:47.618Z)

My dad. I actually grew up just north of Holland. We are probably a little over 30 minutes from there.

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:01:56.016Z)

You scale the tulip festival in Holland?

### You (2025-12-04T18:01:58.978Z)

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. It's their big event. No doubt about that.

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:01:59.056Z)

Big fund. Yeah.

### You (2025-12-04T18:02:06.258Z)

And where are you located right now?

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:02:06.336Z)

Hi. Dan. I'm in Scottsdale, Arizona. Diane, you're on mute.

### You (2025-12-04T18:02:10.898Z)

Ok? Ay.

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:02:14.496Z)

Now. I'm off mute now, right? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Good to see you. To introduce you to my co founder, Howard. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

### You (2025-12-04T18:02:27.458Z)

Yep. We've been chatting here for a minute.

### Guest (2025-12-04T18:02:31.216Z)

Good. Good. So how are you been?

### You (2025-12-04T18:02:41.938Z)

We met a couple years ago when I was at Rediq, when it was owned by Berkadia And she knew some of the brokers there in the hospitality team. So Berkadia had just opened up its first. Office for hospitality. And so we met when we talked about potentially. Enhancing rediq valuation model to work with hotels. As previously, it was specifically a multifamily valuation model. But, yeah, we met there, but we've been working pretty much full time on this since March. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, my mic was muted. I'm sorry, but can we go back to your last question real quick? As soon as you're done. With your thought there. I don't agree with the statement where it says in all cases the functions involved are, unless I'm misinterpreting it, that brokers have a separate use case. From brand owners. Right. Buyers have a separate use case, so I don't, you know, if I'm misinterpreting it, just. Just let me know. But when I read that sentence, I think, Not every time a user. Uses our tool. Will it involve each one of those Personas? Those are all separate Personas in my point of view. So, Diane, if you had something else in mind. Okay? Yes. Yes, that. That is true. The underlying data. Is pretty uniform. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think that's a great summary of it. Yeah. There's just a lot of. Different people involved. Also something to point out that the example financial statement that Diane had up there. They're not standardized. So that financial statement is formatted the way that that owner manager uses. If you go to a different owner or manager, you may have different descriptions for line items. The column headers may not be the same setup, so. While they are essentially using the same underlying data, that underlying data is not standardized. So that's. That's another issue that we need to. Be aware of. Yeah. So in addition to this, let's get back to Excel. The hotel industry. I would say uses Excel exclusively. There are other models similar to what we're creating for other industries, which is, you know, the company I came from. That built it for multifamily. But I can provide a couple different research papers that show that up to 80% of Excel models have an error. Now, the scale of the error is different. You know, it could just simply be a label that's mixed up. But typically, what happens is a lot of times. When they start a new assessment of a deal, they'll take an existing model and just rename it and then go and overwrite some of the assumptions. In that case, you know, there are oftentimes where in order to speed things up, instead of, you know, putting in a particularly difficult formula, They may just hard input a value. So what happens next time you go and use that Excel spreadsheet, rename it for your next deal? That formula's missing, right? There was an example just a couple years ago, not too long ago, where an analyst at a Wall street firm had a one billion dollar miscalculation. On a deal. Those are the ones that make the headlines, right? The other ones don't necessarily do that. So going back. To. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point as well. I don't see that we added it to the what column, but a lot of it is. It is a slow process. And what we had seen at REDIQ and other industries that use these types of models. They've got analysts on their staff that this is what they do all day. They plug numbers into spreadsheets and they're basically screening deals. And they want to get through that quickly because. Every investor is going to have their hurdles that they have to meet their investment criteria, and if it doesn't meet their criteria, then they don't want to spend any more time on it. So that's another thing with this type of automation. Rather than an analyst looking at three or four deals a week, they can look at five or six a day. Just to quickly upload the data, input the information, get their back of the napkin estimates. And in the multifamily. That is going to also speed up the entire sales process. So theoretically, a broker could put a product on the market. In the morning. And could theoretically have an offer that afternoon or the next day, whereas not having to take all of this time or some type of letter intent, maybe not an actual offer. They still have to do their physical inspections and go through that process. But, you know, when you, when you take out that manual work, And manually having to go through. The gathering of the data that could have a huge impact on the overall. Time it takes the process and run through the deals. No, no, exactly. Yeah. And you. You bring up a good point as well. Right. From the seller standpoint. Almost all of them are going to close. Right? You know, unless. Unless all of your offers come in so low that you can't afford to sell it. You have to keep it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So let me. Let me kind of clarify something about the percentage of deals that never close a tool like this. Is not going to necessarily increase the number of deals that close because. Theoretically, whatever data I put into this model is going to give me the same valuation as what I put into Excel. Right. We're all using the same formulas, the same data. But what could happen is that if you and I are both looking at the same deal, You are using our model and you get a valuation within hours, or maybe the next day, I'm using Excel, which is going to take me seven days, you're going to beat me to the punch. So that is really where the advantage is, is when you are competing against other buyers. Who don't use the tool, and they're still in Excel. Right. So, you know, eventually they're going to realize that, yeah, they may have come up with an offer that was more than the winning offer. But they were too late to the game, right, So. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Faster analysis and turnaround time. Can review. More deals in the same amount of time. See that that's one thing we would never do, is market this as a way to reduce headcount, right? So if you're a large institutional investor and you've got 30 analysts on staff, and all of a sudden now you can reduce it down to 10. That's not really helping because all they're doing is, you know, putting a larger pile of paper on those 10 desks to go through, and it's not getting the time savings. So, you know, in. In that particular situation, we're saying, no, you know, don't. Don't reduce headcount. Go through more deals faster and, you know, figure out quickly which ones you are on. There. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. Well, I can, yeah. Give you information from the multifamily side and, you know, some of the competitors, and it literally does go from days to hours. You know, I would need to take a look to see if I have the quantifiable data. But that's really, you know, not only Rediq, but Archer and a lot of the other companies that are in the space. You know, it's just. Takes takes minutes. You just simply drag and drop your financial statement, let it go through and crunch the numbers and extract the data. And all you need to do is tweak with. With your particular assumptions and requirements. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is a valuation model. Is is what it is. And it's not fully automated, but there are ways to automate the vast majority of it, so. Y. Eah. It is. It is. You know, one of the things I always want to make clear is the evaluation model itself is just a way to get our foot in the door. You know, everybody knows. You know the saying, Data is the new oil. Data, data. Everything is about data, right? And what it. What. What we really can do, and what I've already been tinkering with is automating it even more. So our initial version are what we're going to call the minimum viable product that we're going to go out and get. Beta testers, get their opinions. The real automation is just ingesting that financial data. Which is a lot. You know, there's a lot of copy paste that goes into using Excel, where this is just automatically extracting it, mapping it, and they just go in there and input their assumptions. But there are ways that we can also automate those assumptions. So that. They don't always have to go in and put in. Well, you know, what is the, what is, what is, what's the interest rate going to be on my loan? Well, we can go out using AI and web crawlers and see. Okay, well, this type of an asset in Dallas, the current market interest rate is 8%, right? And we can pre populate a lot of that information. So, you know, we, we're going to go from minimal automation to maximum automation. In addition, we can use agentic AI to go out and get other information. They need way more than just financial statements to to make this analysis. They need to know, well, what are my insurance rates going to be? What are the taxes there? How do. How does this prepare compare to previous sales? You know, it's. It's no different than any. Not to this extent, no. But yes, there are, there are some companies out there that are kind of focused on providing the data, but not all of the data. Right. So you've got a lot of market data, like from COSTAR and everybody else, but do they provide the demographic data, the risk data, or anything else? It's. It's not. It wasn't easy to get all this information, but it's getting way easier. Right. If I wanted to go out and get the current property tax information, I would have to try to figure out, you know, what. I know what city it's in, but what, what county is it? You know, the state is. What are these different things where an AI can do that in a fraction of a second? And, you know, I. I tried this on a hotel that I used to stay at all the time in Costa Mesa, California. So I just created a query and, you know, I said, you know, bring up all the previous sale history, bring up the tax records, and bring up the. The five nearest competitors. And in about two minutes, I had all that information. And, you know, I was going through, and it's like, okay, I knew all these properties that were near it. I knew the bad information was correct. It had the correct tax information on it, and, you know, I just had to put together simple query, so. Rather than having to go to multiple third party data sources, which is what people need to do today. You know, they'll go to cost, offer one, they'll go to another for insurance and everything else. We can consolidate that. And when we do that, all of that data that the. Clients are getting back and inputting into their model will be in our database. Right. So. Same thing multifamily. Underwriting. Yeah. Y. Eah. Valuation. Same. Archer is more automated than Rediq. Rediq is still. Well, Rediq is is withering on the vine. It is an underwriting platform. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Michael, I just. I just dropped a document in the chat that might be very helpful for this exercise. We can continue with what we're doing now. But it's. It's something I think you'd find very helpful. Yes. It's a PDF that I just uploaded. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I can email it to you if you're unable to open it. Yeah, yeah. Let's see. I think I closed it out. Let me reopen. Yeah. Yeah. This is a pretty lengthy document. And this kind of goes back to your previous where you know, who are the users. So we do have seven Personas. Obviously the, you know, the first one of the primary would be the hotel brokers and investment teams. But what this does, this kind of goes back down and kind of gives you who is your typical broker. Or investment team, you know, what is their professional background? What are your goals and objectives? Pain points. Et cetera. And then we end up with our value proposition for that particular Persona. And as we continue, you know, then we've got our individual or independent investors. As differentiated from the institutional. Next one would be. Then the next one, the institutional hospitality investors. Same thing with them. What are their goals, pain points, etc. The other one is the hospitality lenders which we mentioned, and what are their background, goals and objections? Then there's the consultants and advisors, which I think we had on that list. The next one is the asset managers. We didn't have asset manager, but I think that's probably what Diane when she meant the owners and the Berends you know, these are the ones who are operating the deals day to day. And what they could potentially use this tool for. And then the last one would be the loan servicing firms. And those are actually going to be our first target market, which would be the lenders and servicers. And a couple, you know, handful of secondary Personas that could potentially make use of this. And, you know, here's. Here's the implications. So if you're. If you're not able to download that document, let me know and I can just email copy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I might also recommend that we change participants to teams. I think that's a fairly common term. Deal teams. I think this is. This is very helpful. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there was two of them. So there was your total addressable market. Total. I have to go back. But basically, there's the total market and then there's the total market that you will be. Focusing on. But then there's a third level. Which is what? How many of that is really realistic? Of what you can possibly get right. Yeah. Yeah. And the article that Diane's referring to was just, you know, how do you present to if you're trying to get funding and you're presenting to a VC team? And talking about how, you know, the TAM is really. Not many VCs don't even consider it because they know you're never, ever going to get the full market value. So just cut to the chase and tell me what you think you can get. Right? So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, I agree. For. For this exercise, I do think the. The tan is relevant. Should be out there. And I think, Diane, I think way back at the beginning, you did put together something that had that information. Yeah. I put something in the chat there, Michael. That shows the number of transactions for 23 and 24. Both in the US and globally, because that's something that we haven't mentioned yet, is we are not limited to the US. You know the process of real estate transaction? Sorry. Lease the valuation. Is fairly universal. You know, all we have to do is change a dollar sign to a euro. Or yen. And you know the mechanics of what we're putting together. Are relatively the same. Right. No, that definitely would be more or less on the serviceable because, you know, it shows the top 100, but how many are there? Are there 101? Are there 10,000? Right. So. There probably would be, the more the serviceable market. Yeah. Yeah. They are to a certain extent. Rediq is more manual than Archer, but Archer, I would probably put more in the middle of that. Row rather than where it is now. It does. I mean, we definitely have the targeted. They are both multifamily. But they do. They are underwriting and deal management. Products as well. So they may be in the same group as InnVestAI. They're just. What? They're tired. Their target is just different than us. If that makes sense. Not likely. And this kind of goes back to what you mentioned earlier about hotels being so different than other asset classes. Michael. I've been in commercial real estate. And multifamily for 30 years. In that 30 years I have never been aware of. Any multifamily owner, investor or manager that also invests in hotels. They are so different. And I think the same is probably true. And, you know, Diane can say, does it go the other way? Is Diane aware of any hotel owners or investors that invest in other asset classes? Maybe. Well, yes. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And. There's nothing stopping Rediq or Archer or anybody else creating a model. Or moving into the hospitality space. But it would require them to create an entirely new model. They can't just make little tweaks to what they've got and say, oh, now we can underwrite hotels. Because there is one thing that I've learned in the past year. It is a big difference. The models are not interchangeable. So, you know, if they want to go through the process of completely building a new model for a market that is much smaller than what they're already addressing, It's a possibility. Yeah. Yeah, multifamily. And just as an FYI, rediq is spelled with a lowercase r. Not that it makes. If it's just internal, that does make any difference. Yeah, they're multifamily as well. Yeah. Let me throw this out, though I don't consider deal path a competitor. They are a portfolio or a pipeline management tool. They're not just multifamily. They pretty much service almost everything but hospitality. But they're more of an asset management tool. So if I deal? Yeah, yeah, they call it deal management, but it's really pipeline. How many properties do I own or how many properties am I looking at? And they consolidate everything. And they're more on the asset management side, which is managing the loans and managing partnership agreements, and who gets what percentage of a split. I don't believe. At least the last time I took a dive into Deal Path, it wasn't a platform that you actually use to value an acquisition. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I was just gonna mention for benefit number four, we may want to put asset management. That is. That is a project that I was implementing at rediq. Which would allow users to continue to use. The functionality in the, in the product, even after the acquisition is complete, and you can, you know, Monitor, for example, your performance against. Long ledger requirements against the market in general. I don't know. That's. That's kind of something that we would do later. And would require more market research on our part. But that is a possibility of something that we could also. Provide. Yeah, and I know Reddit will. Yeah, Rediq. And I'm pretty sure Archer and Dealpath do not. Market or work with lenders. They are really geared towards brokers and investors. I don't know about the other ones. Not rediq. Yeah. My. They can use it for doing a very quick back of the napkin. Appraisal, but there's a lot. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that they do outside of Rediq. But, yeah, I mean, that's. That's something that we could probably add to the list. You would exclude lenders. Berends Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Right? It's. It's a tool that they use to expedite the process. Leave it. Yeah, I would say that I. I don't know for certain that they have any appraiser. Clients, but they are a direct competitor of Rediq, so I would imagine. That whatever we have on one, we'd want with the other. Yeah. I'm going to jump in here real quick. I do have a hard stop in five minutes, so just want to let you know. Yeah, no, that's. That was very accurate. Subject matter experts, but no startup experts, so, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yep. All right. Thanks. Appreciate your help. Bye.
