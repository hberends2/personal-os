# Transcript for: Retirement and career transition chat with former Bell colleague

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:34:50.973Z)

Hey, Howard, can you hear me?

### You (2026-01-22T18:34:52.654Z)

Yeah, very well.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:34:54.893Z)

All right. Good. I'm just now hitting the road. Thanks. With this weather coming in, I really wanted. To go check on some things at our beach house. Just we're not down there all the time with the freezing stuff coming. I just got some things I got to get done down there.

### You (2026-01-22T18:35:04.734Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:35:12.013Z)

So unfortunately.

### You (2026-01-22T18:35:15.214Z)

That's understandable. Right before. Right before 1 o'clock I was out shoveling here. We're not going to get the ice, luckily, but we've got lots of snow over the last week or so, and I look out the window right now and it doesn't even look like I shoveled.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:35:36.093Z)

Oh, gosh. That's so painful. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:35:41.134Z)

So you still grundle?

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:35:44.493Z)

Greensboro, yeah. Greensboro, yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:35:45.774Z)

I think. I'm sorry.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:35:49.933Z)

Still in Greensboro.

### You (2026-01-22T18:35:51.614Z)

When I saw your announcement, I was wondering whether you're going to stay there or head back home in Alabama.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:35:58.573Z)

Yeah. No. Good question. Yeah, we're here. We love North Carolina now. We're really settled in. Our kids are older now, we have grandkids, and everybody settle down in North Carolina. And we bought a place at the beach in the Outer Banks. We really love it. We have no intent on going anywhere.

### You (2026-01-22T18:36:19.694Z)

Yeah. Nice. My middle son is in the Navy, and we made a few trips down to Charleston, and obviously a few times flying stopped in Charlotte. But that's about as close as I've been to Greensboro since I left. Anyway, how's retirement treating you? Been busy.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:36:50.493Z)

Yeah, it has been busy. Busy in a different way. Just investing time differently. And still advising for the company. Bell.

### You (2026-01-22T18:36:59.854Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:37:02.413Z)

For a while. And then also just doing more ministry type work.

### You (2026-01-22T18:37:10.654Z)

Nice.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:37:10.733Z)

And getting involved with some different organizations. They're really trying to. I would say, have a lot more balance than I've had previously. As you know, Bell was a heavy lift, as most corporate jobs are. And just kind of transitioning out of the corporate world. Into more of. The okay, let me be my own boss and kind of figure out what projects I want to take, what present, because I don't want to create margin for other things that are more life giving, if you will.

### You (2026-01-22T18:37:35.054Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:37:38.013Z)

And kind of giving. Giving back might be the better way to think about it.

### You (2026-01-22T18:37:40.574Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah, no, absolutely. That sounds great. I did see a new LinkedIn profile that you were coaching or doing some mentoring and advising. And got to keep busy. Not in the terribly different position myself. I actually kind of consider myself semi retired.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:38:04.093Z)

Okay?

### You (2026-01-22T18:38:08.094Z)

I've been in tech ever since I left Bell. Haven't done any type of asset management or property management or worked for any property management firm since I left. And really kind of feel like I found my niche. I've always. Been obsessed with tech. And analytics and things like that, and I think I've been blessed by having an opportunity to do that. And work with real patients again. Quite a few other ones. But I find myself. Being almost double the age of. The average person in doing what I've been doing. And I've applied for a few jobs. The last job I had was Rediq. I don't know if you're familiar with brokerage and investment underwriting platform. And I did a lot of work with them, but they got sold. And the new owner, everybody was offshore eastern Kosovo, and his entire developing team was from Kosovo. And basically everybody from what IQ got laid, awfully transitioned everything overseas. And so that happened last January. Been a year. But in the meantime, I've applied to a couple positions and the phone interview is going great. They're just like, oh, yeah, this is perfect. You've got everything you're looking for. Then all of a sudden, they see this guy, 64 years old. And the story changes. It's like, get an email.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:40:03.773Z)

I know.

### You (2026-01-22T18:40:05.454Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:40:07.773Z)

Yeah. It's hard, isn't it? Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:40:10.574Z)

It. Is. But. During that time at rediq, they were on Diaperkadia. And their kadia. Had a hotel. Office. They were trying to expand out of multifamily and get into more asset types. And so I met a lady who was a consultant and had been in. The hotel industry for over 30 years. And she wanted to build a valuation model strictly for hotels. And I would always assume that there already was one, because every other asset class. Has a vendor that has number writing model. Well, sure enough, she was absolutely right. It's such a small niche. Market. And everybody uses Excel, but they're all the same models. Had a good opportunity.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:41:16.973Z)

I hate it.

### You (2026-01-22T18:41:17.854Z)

Work and working with her. And putting together a hotel. Valuation model. And that's kind of opened some doors to other startups. And this is what prompted me to call you. I've been speaking to another developer. The hotel thing is definitely not a full time job. It's a lot of just consulting, helping put together the proof of concept, et cetera. And so got contacted by. A serial entrepreneur. He has developed quite a few different products, mostly in fintech. But the last couple of things he's done has been in multifamily. I don't know if you're familiar with. That changed where it was bought out and then changed the name to Lettuce.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:42:16.893Z)

No, I have not. I have not heard of them.

### You (2026-01-22T18:42:19.374Z)

Yeah. No, they weren't huge, but they were really growing quickly. It's one of those where residents can. Earn money or get money back from their rent and accumulate for down payments. And that type of fintech. What you reached out to me about is a lot of the stuff I've actually did at Bell, because now he wants to create a tool that is into mid size or smaller. Multifamily owners and managers at either the controller or the CFO level to do a fully automated cash flow projection. Tool because his hypothesis is that everybody does it in Excel. That they have to get all the scattered information from different sources.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:43:18.573Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:43:23.054Z)

Put it into an Excel model and try to focus their cash positions in the next 30, 60, 90 days. And of course, I've been working a ton in AI and doing a lot of things there, and I think there's a good opportunity, but it's not going to be like an AI tool. And so I thought, I need to talk to somebody that's in that type of a role, because I don't know. If there's a demand for that type of tool. I think if you are a larger organization and you're using yarity or real page. There's probably already some type of feature. In those products that would do the same thing. But I think a lot of the smaller companies, number one, they can't afford the full yard of your real page suite. And number two, a lot of them use third party accounting tools. Some of them like QuickBooks or anything else.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:44:26.973Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:44:28.094Z)

I wanted to pick your brain on that. And just coming from a CFO and working with the controllers and having the forecast cash flow, do you think his hypothesis is correct? Is everybody still using Excel and manually copying and pasting.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:44:47.533Z)

Yeah. I would. I would say you're right. I think for the smaller organizations, the answer would be yes. It has been a very frustrating area within yardy. And real page. Really? Both of those products, they're not there. They're just not. We tested Yardy. And it's like you think they could get it together, but budgeting and forecasting. I don't think they're there now. Maybe something's changed. But we looked at it. As recently as three years ago. And we're frustrated, so we talked to some other large REITs. I won't give their names. I'm sure you'd recognize the REITs. Because I'm like, I don't understand why we're having to create the hamster wheel here. Somebody's had to do this.

### You (2026-01-22T18:45:27.774Z)

Yes.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:45:36.573Z)

The tool we landed on Howard, and we built our own cash flow model within it. And so I'm quite sure that this company now is doing it is called Vena. Have you heard of Venom?

### You (2026-01-22T18:45:48.894Z)

Is it? V e m m.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:45:50.253Z)

V e m. V e n a just v e n a venom.

### You (2026-01-22T18:45:54.574Z)

Okay, okay.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:45:56.573Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:45:58.654Z)

It sounds familiar, but I researched it.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:45:59.053Z)

And so, you know. I would research it. Were you there when we put an IBM cognos, weren't you? Or was that after you?

### You (2026-01-22T18:46:11.854Z)

Was like, right at the very beginning of the transition.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:46:17.613Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:46:18.734Z)

When I left.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:46:21.693Z)

So that kind of felt like Excel. You know, I would say this still, if you pulled it up, you go, looks like Excel, but it's not Excel. It's a database in the background. And it kind of overlays and it pulls data from. I mean, we're pulling data from. You know, when I left, we were pulling data from, you know, Yieldstar. We were pulling data from. Our workday system. We were pulling data from Yardy. We were pulling data from some other market research things. So that's one thing. The second thing we used to build out. Was. Is building like cash forecasting dashboards. And so we used power. We use power bi for that.

### You (2026-01-22T18:47:00.414Z)

Y. Eah. Okay? Yeah. That makes sense. As well.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:47:06.653Z)

Microsoft power bi and we looked at a lot of different things, but, you know, for the money, Limited investments that you already had Microsoft products. It was not. It was not that much more expensive and was so those two tools that really.

### You (2026-01-22T18:47:18.574Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:47:24.173Z)

And I heard. I just had dinner with Lily last night, and she told me that this year's, you know, every year, the budget's gotten better and better and better. She's like, this has been the best year ever. I'm like, well, good. That's probably because I left. But I think it largely is due to the technology and the platform and the people we. Put in place.

### You (2026-01-22T18:47:42.974Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:47:43.213Z)

So those will be my thoughts. I do think there's a big need for it. I don't think it's solved. For the. Smaller companies. With that being said, I know what I think Vena recognize there was an opportunity in this space. I don't think I'm giving up any kid competitive info. But I think they were trying to. It'd be worth reaching out to them just because I think.

### You (2026-01-22T18:48:04.174Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:48:06.733Z)

They are attempting to build out all these templates to kind of sell with their product.

### You (2026-01-22T18:48:11.694Z)

Right.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:48:11.853Z)

Say, hey, buy veno and pay $100,000 or whatever the cost is. And you will get these 10 templates.

### You (2026-01-22T18:48:18.254Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:48:20.413Z)

So I had. Because I had a lot of battles with them. I'm like, I saw it in a demo. I'm like, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. That's Bell's model. Like, you can't do that. Like we had an agreement. You weren't going to take our stuff and resell it. So we had a little bit of a battle. You know what I mean? So we had a little. Oh, well, we were doing. Yeah, you are. That's my model. Other than the property name, it's freaking our model. I've seen it a hundred times. Matter of fact, it started when Howard was here.

### You (2026-01-22T18:48:45.454Z)

I was being said. I'm going to take a look at that just to see how familiar it looks.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:48:54.413Z)

Yeah, so that's probably where I would start. Before you got too deep with the other. I just think that. You know it's a need. And depending on how user friendly and the interface you could put in place with it, it's going to have to, you know, integrate with your already and play nice with a real page and all. Those. It's got to be integratable, whatever the right word is.

### You (2026-01-22T18:49:17.294Z)

One of the very first things that I brought up is that you have to have the rent roll, you have to have the lease expiration reports. You have to have some idea of marketing. A lot of those things that I put into the Excel budget model where we were importing those reports and then trying to calculate your turnover. I mean, there's a ton of operational data that needs to go into this, and I'm sure there's way more than that, but those are the three most obvious ones that I came up with. In order to really know your cash flows. And other things that are not necessarily coming from the site, your tax payments and any other additional seasonal contracts, et cetera, that all have to be taken into consideration. So I think that's going to be the biggest challenge, and that's one thing that he's got a lot of experience in, is integration into different types of systems, but. Let's face it. I work. I work for real, Page. For five years, and I was leading the invoice processing. And BI and the billing for their utility management program. And we needed to get access into another real page product. And we were treated just like an outside client, even though we were another world age product. To get an API into what we needed. Data resistant even there. They do not like to integrate with others. They make it difficult. And that's going to be a challenge. There are the ones out there that will welcome you with open arms. But the big ones, real page yardy. They make it extremely expensive. It'll be difficult.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:51:28.253Z)

Yeah, for sure. And the one thing you know, you knew that you knew this about real pays. I mean, it's always frustrated me like it was so siloed. Like they would go buy a great bolt on product like lro. They would never really fully integrate it. And, you know, they just run it as a separate product. And it got worse because you lost the focus of the founders that knew the product. It was very, very, very frustrating.

### You (2026-01-22T18:51:56.814Z)

I don't know how it's been since Steve Nguyen left, so I left them in 2020 to go to Rediq. So before Steve retired. But yeah, I mean, they even acknowledged it. They said, we know internally they would say this. We know we've got the reputation of the jack of all trades, master of none. Their business novel is built on acquisitions. They don't create or do anything. On their own. And when they're purchased, they're still operated.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:52:32.413Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:52:35.694Z)

As their own profit center. And that was one of the issues that I've had with the API. They were charging. They wanted to charge their own department, the utility management. $20,000 to build an API, and then based in monthly billing. It's like, wait a minute. We're page. Why do we have to do that? They acknowledge that. But they don't do anything about it. But again, Dirk is in place now. I like Dirk a lot. He was a good person to work with. And maybe things are going to change. But, yeah, it never really made much sense to me at all how they do that.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:53:22.093Z)

Y. Eah. Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:53:24.334Z)

Don't you make the full transition to Yardi? Or did you make the full transition real page? When I was there, you were comparing.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:53:30.173Z)

We. We made. The fold. We made the full transition yard. This is better. Integration.

### You (2026-01-22T18:53:36.094Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:53:40.573Z)

Really? You know what happened was a knot yard he came. To the arty presentation. I'd really like a knot a lot, Just high integrity.

### You (2026-01-22T18:53:47.134Z)

Y. Es.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:53:50.173Z)

You know, willing to work with us to try to make it work, and did, and just they've been a great partner. Steve Wynn came in, and, man, it was like, you know, we were trying to do, like, an rp. Through process. I mean. He got. He got blocked. He was not happy. We were changing. You're ripping out the spine of your company. I can't believe you would do this. It's stupid. I'm like, whoa. Okay? You know, Yardy's terrible. Instead of talking about all his benefits, he kind of came in hot.

### You (2026-01-22T18:54:17.374Z)

Yeah, well, I was part of. Yeah, I was part of those meetings, and that didn't surprise me at all.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:54:19.053Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:54:24.014Z)

But yeah, you're right. The personality between Steve Wynn and the non are like night and day are just totally different people.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:54:30.813Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### You (2026-01-22T18:54:33.214Z)

So who is the other guy that was with him, John? I forgot his last name, but he was the CEO now. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:54:43.933Z)

He's not. John Pendergast is still there. He's taking a different role now.

### You (2026-01-22T18:54:48.894Z)

Okay, okay.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:54:56.013Z)

Did you know Akshay?

### You (2026-01-22T18:54:57.054Z)

I. Did not. No.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:54:59.293Z)

OP Shane Akshay has taken over now. It's taken over the reins. He is Anat's nephew.

### You (2026-01-22T18:55:10.734Z)

Okay? Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:55:14.653Z)

I like. The one that built. P to P. They're in voice processing system. He was the one that kind of built that built that and kind of developed and sold it and managed that profit center for a long, long time, and then.

### You (2026-01-22T18:55:25.054Z)

Okay? Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:55:34.173Z)

Took over some bigger pictures and eventually just kind of moved his way all the way up the chain. But really bright, smart guy. You know, they're building out this reward software system. Built was the biggest one you were talking about, like, reward system for rent and stuff. Have you heard of built?

### You (2026-01-22T18:55:50.094Z)

Y. Eah. Y. Eah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:55:55.933Z)

That was an interesting company. I still understand how they make money. I don't know. Whatever happened with that, we didn't move over to that. That didn't land well in our op state, but we didn't use it.

### You (2026-01-22T18:56:04.254Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:56:05.533Z)

So at least while I was there, they may have done it now.

### You (2026-01-22T18:56:09.694Z)

I don't know. I've seen a lot of those companies start up and then go out of business. And if you, if you do a lot of research on them, if you just do some online research, look for their customer sentiment, A lot of the residents. Don't have a lot, lot of good things to say about it. So I don't know that those programs have been effective at all. I don't know if anybody's really pulled that off yet. It's one of those things on paper, but, yeah, it doesn't really pan out the way they want it to be.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:56:37.773Z)

Y. Eah, yeah. The map. Didn't work. Yeah, I think it's right. All right. So, well, tell me about your family. What's going on with your family?

### You (2026-01-22T18:56:54.814Z)

Well, we were empty Westerns for a short period of time. My son, Bella. My oldest son. If you know, he's actually doing very well. He's always been. Into music and digital production. And so he got a job at Sweetwater. Which is the largest musical instrument distribution company in the world. They're based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. So he's been down there. As a sales rep, but he's actually probably going to move back home in March. He's going to start his own digital editing and digital. I don't know. Digital entertainment, digital music. Company. And he's going to work with. I've got a nephew who has been involved with professional sports. Entertainment. They do a lot of the, you know, the Jumbotron, and they do a lot of advertising, and he's worked for all of the major league teams, and he's doing extremely well. So hopefully Noah can help him out. Nick by adopted son. He's in the Navy. And he went into the nuke program. The power plant, not the missiles. And he's serving on submarines. He just finished up his last. They had like an 18 month, basically, like going back to college, training. Program. That's when he was down in Charleston in April, finished up, and now he's on the USS Iowa, which was just a brand new. Virginia class sub that Joe was just commissioned in April at the same time. So brand new sum. They're still undergoing a lot of testing and they're not even. They don't even carry weapons yet. They've got to get accredited and everything tested out. So these only been on short trips. Nothing like the six or seven month deployments.

### Guest (2026-01-22T18:59:29.933Z)

Six months.

### You (2026-01-22T18:59:31.134Z)

Yeah, yeah. Which, you know, it's okay now, but it's going to be weird because anybody who's serving on a Virginia class are pretty much most of the subs. They're never allowed to tell when they're going to go anywhere, when they're going to be back. So it's like. The only way you know that he's deployed somewhere is when we text him. And the text comes back green. So it's like texts that are coming back green. He's obviously off somewhere. But yeah.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:00:05.933Z)

Wow. That's crazy. That would be really hard as a parent.

Y. Eah. Yeah, yeah. I think probably the longest they've been gone is three weeks. And it's just basically up and down the east coast and, you know, they do a lot of just testing the electronic equipment, stuff like that, so they've never gone out. And because the Iowa is brand new and it's like their flagship sub, they've gone to a lot of government or political type. Of. Events. Annapolis and a few other areas where they just pull up to the dock and everybody can see the new toy. That's about it. And then Face is working in Grand Rapids.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:00:55.373Z)

Yeah.

### You (2026-01-22T19:01:01.774Z)

She's a preschool teacher, and she just absolutely loves it. So she's. She's doing very well.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:01:12.093Z)

That's great.

### You (2026-01-22T19:01:13.214Z)

She moved out of August, and that's when we became mt Masters. But I think that's going to be ending here. At least a short time until Nola gets his thing up and running. So that's it? Yeah. Carrie, she's still dean of the kinesiology department teaching at Calvin University up here.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:01:28.333Z)

That's correct. Good. Awesome. I'm glad to hear things are going so well.

### You (2026-01-22T19:01:47.054Z)

Likewise. Glad to hear you're doing everything. Good to hear about the monastery part. What are you doing there? Just volunteering.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:02:01.373Z)

Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, none of it's for pay, so I guess it's all volunteering. I'm doing more with my church serving and leadership there. Where I can help. We've grown so much.

### You (2026-01-22T19:02:14.974Z)

Very cool.

### Guest (2026-01-22T19:02:16.733Z)

Like we. It's. It's been unbelievable. And then. Spending time in a ministry called Search Ministries. And it's really working with people to help them take one step closer to God. And then working with another group called Halftime, which. Really helps men kind of process what's next in life. So kind of ties into executive coaching a little bit. I would say more life coaching, maybe. And so doing. Doing that as well. So those are kind of the major lanes right now where I'm investing time.

### You (2026-01-22T19:02:46.734Z)
