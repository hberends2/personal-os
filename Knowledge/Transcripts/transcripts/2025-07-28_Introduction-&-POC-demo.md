ping me if there's any change. Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:03:41.358Z)

Sure. Thank you. Okay. So we have Raj here. I think Shivam is gonna join. Within a minute. Raj, can you hear us? Yes. I'm there.

### You (2025-07-28T12:06:12.205Z)

Alright.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:06:12.578Z)

Yeah. And Howard, Raja is saying he has some camera issue with his laptop. He couldn't turn it on even yesterday. He's trying to fix that. Actually, I had some issues with related issues. So I I think I I need to give it for servicing. Might take some time. For the time being, I'll try to join like this. Okay. That's fine.

### You (2025-07-28T12:06:48.045Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T12:07:03.125Z)

Alright. So so let me go ahead and and start by

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:07:07.788Z)

Yep.

### You (2025-07-28T12:07:09.775Z)

and then maybe, Raj and Shivam, if you could go ahead and just

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:07:10.908Z)

So

### You (2025-07-28T12:07:14.685Z)

give me a quick background on you, and then we'll kinda head over the the product real quick just to kinda get everybody up to speed. So my name is Howard, Howard Berends. I've been with or been in the commercial real estate industry for a little over thirty years. Prior to founding this company, I was more involved with multifamily or apartment communities. So while I have quite a bit of experience in commercial real estate, this hotel industry is is pretty new to me as well. So all gonna be learning a lot over the next few weeks, months, years, etcetera. But definitely looking forward to working with the team on this. So during that time period, I was on the investment side and the property operations side for about half that time. So I have gone through numerous property acquisitions and dispositions and buying real estate is fairly similar between, you know, whether it's a an apartment community or a hotel, but there are special nuances to each. Property class. And so that's what we are in the process of building a tool that is focused on those nuances of the hotel industry and today, there is no tool like it in the industry, whereas multifamily, that that's where I'm at the node at our previous, employer where we built a valuation tool for multifamily. Office buildings, industrial, all those different property classes have a tool like what we're building, but there is nothing in a hotel. It's basically been overlooked. So that's where we come in. And so along with Diane Mark and Drew, Vinod and I have been working with them I met Diane It's been two years now. When she approached she and I spoke when Vinod and I were at RedeyeQ. And, so we've kinda kept in touch over the last couple years. And finally, it back in January. We decided to to go ahead and get rolling on this project. So I will be responsible for the product management response or for the product management in InnVest. Working very closely with the node. On the engineering team Mark and Drew and Diane, I will probably have a meeting soon where they can kinda introduce themselves, but really, Diane is the one who's really kinda putting this all together. Don't have formal titles yet. So we're working on that. But I would consider Diane to be the CEO. I mean, this is her idea. She's been working on this for way longer than than I met her. She's been working on this for probably five years. Mark, is really his his responsibility is he's gonna be raising the capital. That we need to get this off the ground. And so right now, he's he's kind of waiting for this for this MVP. So that he can start going to some investors and and working on that. And then Drew is is he he's got his own startup. But it's very adjacent to what we're doing where he is collecting the data and creating certain reports for hotel operators. So he's not in the acquisitions part of the journey, but he does have, relationships and data from hotels that are operating day to day. Let's put it that way. And I think that there's a great synergy between the two. So I I I think we're gonna be ending up, you know, kind of merging the the the two organizations, the one that he has along with the InnVestAI day. So we'll have data coming from InnVest from the acquisition activities. Drew will have data from the operations, you know, once they buy the property and they're operating it. And combined, we will have a very strong organization. So before I turn it over, I I I think the the the way to think about this is the tool that we're building is definitely the core of InnVestAI. But it's not the end game. I think everybody knows, you know, data is is the endgame. And what puts us in a very unique position is that when you go through the acquisition process, you get a lot of historical data from the seller and the broker. We then ingest that into our model where then the the buyer will then project forward and think, you know, here's what I can operate it for the next few years. This is what I think it's gonna be worth. At the end of the hold period, and that's how they determine what they want to pay for the hotel. And that's that's the magic right there. Is that anybody can get historical data. Nothing special about that. But we'll have users who are projecting three, five, ten years in the future. So we'll be the only ones who actually has forward looking data. Right? So that's really where the value of this tool lies. Is using that core product to get that forward looking data to combine with the historical data. Us in a very unique position. So with that, I'll turn it over to you. I'm Raj, if you wanna go ahead and start and just kinda introduce yourself and give me a little bit of information. On your background. Okay. Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:14:25.068Z)

Yeah. One moment, guys. Okay? Before we go forward. So I'm gonna

### You (2025-07-28T12:14:26.525Z)

Okay. Well, you're you're on you're on camera, just so you know.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:14:28.898Z)

driving. I'm here, but I'm off camera. And, yeah, thank you, Howard, for the detailed introduction.

### You (2025-07-28T12:14:34.955Z)

Okay.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:14:36.538Z)

I I'll be off camera now. Yeah. Uh-huh. Great. Thank you. Glad you can go ahead. Okay. So So, basically, my name is Raj. And I've been in touch with Vinod for quite some time. Like, I actually used to work in one of his friend's company. And I used to I was a full stack engineer with in the box background. And he just recently had an for me. So, like, I asked him if I could join and join the team or not. So be working closely with both of them, like, Ashram and Shivam, known for around two to three years. And, like, we've been bug working the way the phone. Some time. Like that.

### You (2025-07-28T12:15:41.215Z)

Alright. Well, thank you, and and welcome to the team.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:15:44.738Z)

And if you have any questions, I'm open to that.

### You (2025-07-28T12:15:46.095Z)

Looking forward to to working with you. Sivan?

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:15:51.538Z)

Thank you. Sure. Yeah. My name is Shivam and there's a thing going on.

### You (2025-07-28T12:16:05.525Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:16:06.218Z)

Actually, I live close to a airport. So things go from up there. Yeah. My name is, and I previously, I was working on a project which was a full stack, and I implemented the full stack project with cloud also. I learned a lot about cloud and full stack, like, React. And all the data receiving stuff.

### You (2025-07-28T12:16:34.505Z)

Well, thank you.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:16:35.998Z)

Yep. That's it. I'm good.

### You (2025-07-28T12:16:36.495Z)

And I can I can empathize with the airport situation for

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:16:39.278Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T12:16:41.315Z)

many years, I lived just north of the Dallas Fort Worth one of the I think it is probably I think it's the third busiest airport in the country? Behind Atlanta and Chicago. And and we were actually straight on the runway. So it was either straight going over us to taking off or straight over us landing. So they can be distracting. I understand that. So well well, cool. Cool. I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:17:20.208Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T12:17:21.305Z)

and, you know, take a minute and and I'm not gonna get in-depth. You guys are gonna have plenty of opportunity to really dig into this but, I thought it would probably be very helpful if if we can just kinda give you an overview and and I'll I'll approach it from the business aspect. Right? And and try to give you the why behind some of these. But again, I not gonna get into a lot of details, so you should be able to view on my screen now. This is this is the proof of concept. In general, this is this is based the tool we're building. But being the proof of concept, I'm sure we're gonna be making changes and tweaks and and and make make it's probably not gonna look exactly like I'm showing here when we're done. So when the user logs in, one thing I wanna point out is there is a pipeline link here but this is not something that would typically be inside the tool. So I wanna differentiate between when a user logs in they will be logging in and viewing the InnVestAI user home page, not the not the public web page. And this pipeline will typically be part of that. Page. What I'm showing here, this is what this is the tool that the that the users will be building. So on that page, there will be a link that says, you know, open up the InnVestAI valuation model, you know, something to that effect. And then they'll see everything basically from the property details on down. But I did include the pipeline here because that's also going to be a launching point. So the pipeline can be just considered a list of all the deals that they've been working on Right? So it could be you know, one property, it could be 10, it could be a 100. Depending on the size of the the client. How many deals they typically do. But we're also going to be in consolidation with Drew's company. We're also going to be targeting the owners of the not just the the the sellers and the brokers. So we will have additional tools available that a hotel operator will use. So not everything in the pipeline is something to be bought or sold. It could be something that they'll use for the next five years, while they're operating the property. So you can imagine here that there will be you know, a list of properties. Right? So when I log in, I've got all my hotels here. You know, there there will be a photo here in this in this column, and maybe I get a new deal. I can click on the new deal, and it's gonna bring me and I'm con start inputting the property details. I'm not gonna go through all this right now. And then so I've got my second deal here. And so on and so on. Right? So I could have the now I've got three deals in here, etcetera. Now if I wanted to typically, an underwriting process takes weeks. Because you're gathering material, you're underwriting, There's a lot more activity going on besides just filling in this model. Right? You've got to go and physically inspect the property. You've gotta get with bankers and everybody else. So this isn't something where I'm gonna log in and in ten minutes be ready to submit an offer. To the seller. Right? Because I've got all this other stuff that has to be done in the meantime. So while that process is going on, the idea here is that I can then click on one of these properties. I don't have it in the POC. But I can also click in this property and and go to any item in here to continue the process. Right? So I may make some certain assumptions the first time I set this up And then I may find that some of those assumptions need to be tweaked so I can go back in here, make changes, do whatever I need to do. K? Alternatively, you know, I could come in here and click on the property details and do the same thing here. So I can create a new property, There are certain fields in here that are mandatory. You can see others that are optional. When I click on the next now this is where we are controlling what line items are going to be displayed in the tool when I look at my historical data and project forward. So a hotel might just be nothing but rooms. Right? You check-in, you go to your room. There's no restaurant, there's nothing else. Other hotels may have everything. It could be a resort. Right? Where it might have multiple restaurants. So in the proof of concept, we are not going down to any of these lower levels. But in a future state the user can select exactly what they have. So they may have a fine dining restaurant, They may have a wine bar. Or you know, they can keep on going down or but for the time being, all they're gonna say is, yeah. I have food and beverage. Let me just deselect that. And then in the other operated are things like spas, recreation, retail, which would be like, you know, it could be a gift shop. Things like that. And miscellaneous, this is where we get into whether they have resort fees and there's other items down here, like if they charge for parking. Other items right there. Or like I said, they might be buying a hotel that doesn't have any of these Just it's just rooms, and that's it. And they can click on none. Now in the MBP we will just be having these three line items. In the other revenue and other expense. So we don't have this set up dynamic I would like to have it but, you know, this will be a nice to have for the MVP. But as it stands right now, we'll just include these lines whether the deal has them or not. Then when I click on next, this is where I can upload my documents that I get from the broker or from the seller. Right? They're gonna give me the financial statements from the prior years so I can see the historical operations. You can just drag and drop or choose the files And so what we wanna do for the time being is when they upload a file, you know, wanna tell us what it is. So we have financial statements STR reports, you're gonna be hearing that a lot. That's a industry standard report that nearly every hotel subscribes to. And and it just has all sorts of occupancy information, what are their rates, what are the amenities, all these different things. It's a very detailed report, an operating report for hotel hotels. And then the new one that I just recently added that will be a future state would be the offering memorandum. Now when a property goes for sale, you're you're gonna hear two different terms used. There's the they call it the offering memorandum. And that's like a a PDF marketing material where it's got pictures of the hotel. It'll have a map that shows where it's located. It'll list all of the amenities, talk about the area, give you some historical information. It's basically a book that the broker puts together to give to sellers to give them as much information on the property as they can. 'll also hear it called a BOV, which is the the broker's opinion of value. It's the same thing as an offering memorandum. So you're gonna hear the term OM, or BOV. It's the same thing. Right? That offering memorandum or BOV has a lot of the information that we need to input into this model. So our goal is to be able to use AI whether it be agentic AI or whether it just be a computer vision to extract that information from these PDFs. And prepopulate a lot of these fields for the for our users. Right? So instead of them having to back here and type in the the property name and and the address, and all this information, we can just scan that offering memorandum and pre populate all of this for them. Right? I think we can get to a point and this is with existing technology today, where we can prop populate easily. 80 or 90% of this model. Even some of the forward looking information because the the broker not only tells you how it's been operated up until the point it's for sale, In order for the broker to determine the sale price, have to use a model just like this. They have to go through the same process as the buyer to come up with their estimated value, and that information is in the offering memory and the model also. So we could pre populate both the historical and give the user a starting point for their projections. They may often disagree with the the broker Mhmm. And put in different numbers and they can tweet but we can save them the time of having to go and pre populate that information. Right? So so the goal within the next probably year or two is to have as much automation as possible. You know, because we've also got the ability to use agentic AI to go out and get, you know, what are the tax rates in this in this area. What are the insurance? All these different data that the user has to input that they typically have to research and and get that information themselves too, so we can do that for them. Okay. So I promise not to go into the weeds and and that's that's really kind of the the the whole gist of it right So from this point forward, I'll keep it high level. So after the user has gone through and populated the property details, the next thing they wanna do is the market data. So the market comps, this is actually the star report here. You can see up here it's got the star code. We call it star, s t r. This is not all of the information, but this is the high level information that that report has. So the idea is we want the users to upload these reports because there is like I said, there's more information on there than what's shown on the screen. And then that way, we can also benefit from having that data in the system. Right? The operating statistics this is also something that we can populate from the the bright OM. Or the BOV. And all this is showing is year by year, you know, so right now, this is what the user would manually input, but you can you know, you can input the year and I can say, well, back in 2024, you know, there was 123 available rooms. It was 87% occupied. At which point then it'll calculate the RevPAR, you know, the ADR, etcetera, etcetera. Right? And the idea is, you know, this might be property one, comps, and then I go back and I can continue to add as many properties as I want. I wanna go back and clarify that this would not be the property that I'm buying These would be properties around the property I'm buying, my competition. I wanna know what's going on with my competition. Right? So that is something that is included And then same thing. Now the transaction summary is not only do I wanna know how my competition is operating, I wanna know what have other properties sold for in that area. So I can kind of get an idea of what this property is worth. Based on other properties in the area. That have recently sold. Right? So right now, again, just like the other one, this is this is the manual input, you know, this could be comp one that's sold in you know, whatever year, etcetera. You go and fill that in. There might be two or three properties that have sold in the last year or two, and I can get all this information in there. And again, not all of this information is in the in that PDF that you get from the broker because they probably won't list the buyer or, you know, who the lender was. But when we spoke to Drew, mentioned that a lot of the process is the the the potential buyer, which would be our client, a lot of times, they spend a lot of time on the phone. They'll just call their people that they know in the industry. They may call the manager of CompOne. They may know who the manager is. And say, hey. What's you know, and and just conversationally, a lot of this information that they'll fill in here. Right? So some of this cannot ever be automated if that's the case. Right? If if it requires somebody calling somebody one of their contacts, get this information, But they can still go through here and and input that data. And all of this information is is like a I I consider it to be, like, a huge funnel that you're getting all of this information about the property itself, about competitive properties, and you're using that data to keep narrowing down until you get to that one number that you say yes. This is what I feel the property is worth. And then as a buyer, that's the number that I would submit to the broker. The valuation this is when the buyer starts getting into the the details, of purchasing the deal. Right? A lot of these well, I would say pretty much all of these buyers, nobody really buys it by themselves. They always have partners. And they're also going to have to get loans from the bank and that's where all of this information comes in. So without getting into the weeds, cap rate, this is what is used to determine the value of the property. Based on the information that's gonna be put in the pro form a So you can input all this information. Financing, this is where you've got all the information you here for the loan. So they would input these deals to come up with their financing assumptions down here. I I didn't refresh this page before the call. Should've. There's a new one that was just added for the equity, which is your partner information. So I might have as a buyer, one partner. I might have three all contribute a certain percentage of the money. They all have different requirements. That's the pet tab I would input there. And then exit, this is my assumption of what's gonna happen at the time that I sell the property. Again, cap rate is part of a mathematical formula that determines what this value is. Right here, the sales price. This is so I'm thinking I'm going to be able to purchase it for this and I'm gonna be able to sell it for that. But this is a total guessing game. It's it's an educated guess by the buyer because this could be five years from now. Could be ten years from now. You don't know what the cap rate going to be at that time. You're just gonna have to guess based on your industry knowledge, historical, etcetera. Also, from this point on, the valuation, pro form a, and investment summary, we're gonna have key metrics at the top. These are just samples and in the POC these are hard coded. So they do not change when I change numbers down here. But in the model they will. And any time you change any of these values on any of these pages, you know, values will change and this way the the user can monitor the every input that they make because they're going to have minimum requirements. Right? They may have a partner that will not invest in a deal unless the IR is greater than 10%. Right? So if I make adjustments here, in this IRR the, that's the internal rate of return, drops below 10%, then I know my partner won't invest. And so then I'll have to go and make some different assumptions or try to change something. So not only do we wanna display these, but we also wanna make these, you know, conditional. So, like, if it does drop below the minimum requirement, you know, maybe this is red, right, or something along those lines. So once I've gone through and I've input the the four tabs that are on here, not three, the next thing I do is I go on to the pro form a. And this is where we were looking at yesterday and this gets into each individual department section and line item So this is where I go one by one to make my changes here. And one thing that I mentioned yesterday about why my preference is for using a sidebar instead the tabs on top is because you can see as I scroll through here, all of this information on top is is frozen or sticky so that I can constantly maintain a view of these numbers because just like these cards up here, every line item here, except for the historical information, of course, that's not gonna change. But all of this information over here in my forecast section as I make changes down here it will affect this information here. So just like these cards, you know, we can consider those, like, those are the really important items for the investment but this information down here is more for operational and it's broken down by year. So here, if I'm going to have all of this information through my holding period, I need to make sure that every time I make a change done here, that this information is still in line. So these are some of the key metrics So for the occupancy section here, here's my historical occupancy and this is what I'm projecting down here. You can see my subject property occupancy here is is correlated to down here. So if I change that to eighty, know, I can change that, and you can see all all these things were are gonna change in real time. So that then I can also see the impact up here. In real time. Every time I make a change, in any of these items, where there's an input. So as you scroll down, you can see you've got other sections here. Now there's my RevPAR. All of this information is also up here in the expense and revenue sections. And so as I get down here and I start making my projections, you can see I've got all zeros here. For my total. I can expand this then to see my each individual group that I was mentioning before And and so this is where all of my financial information, where I go down through here through revenue expense and all these inputs will be shown in these metrics cards. And the last thing we want is for our user to have to input or make assumptions here and then click on another tab to go and look at it and might bounce away. This is designed and Drew, who has and Mark and Diane who have underwritten hundreds of hotels, the workflow that we have from top to bottom is the exact workflow that a business analyst will go through. So that's that's how it's designed. So I can start here and and just input this information. I can keep tabbing or scrolling through this to go through each of these inputs, I can input my forecast all the way from top to bottom without having to jump to like, revenue on this screen and then expenses over here and occupancy on a different screen, because that's no different than their experience using Excel. And this is what we're trying to show is that this is going to be way more efficient than their Excel models. And that's going to be a battle, and I think you know, the node was around RedIQ, long enough to know that people love their Excel models. And it's hard to get them to convert to a web app like this unless they can be shown that it's faster and more accurate. And that's one thing that I I point out. I mean, I spent years in and I got to be the what I would consider a top level Excel user I could write VBA code. I can do all sorts of things in Excel. I love Excel. But I also know how dangerous Excel is. Right? There's studies that show a huge percentage of Excel spreadsheets contain errors. Whether they you know, it's a huge error if if it's a formula,

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:42:46.648Z)

But

### You (2025-07-28T12:42:46.915Z)

There's other errors in there as well. It's not uncommon at all for me to be using Excel much and overwrite a formula and for this specific deal or change a formula that's specific to that deal. And then a new deal comes along, and I take that model and I click and I do a save as. And now it's the model that I use for the new one. But, oh, I forgot that this cell down here was changed because and all of a sudden, it's wrong. Right? So the selling point for this yes. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:43:35.808Z)

Yeah. Our story both sorry for interrupting.

### You (2025-07-28T12:43:37.425Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:43:40.358Z)

Just thinking if you could, clear out some of the words that we use in the industry, like,

### You (2025-07-28T12:43:45.805Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:43:48.578Z)

underwriting, assumptions, cap rate,

### You (2025-07-28T12:43:49.725Z)

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely definitely can do that.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:43:52.658Z)

pro form a, if you could briefly explain to our new folks

### You (2025-07-28T12:43:58.865Z)

So

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:43:59.418Z)

that would be definitely helpful

### You (2025-07-28T12:44:00.255Z)

basically, I I don't need to get into the rest of these. Are also this investment

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:44:02.158Z)

for them. And they'll kind of feel comfortable using these words.

### You (2025-07-28T12:44:05.045Z)

summary.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:44:05.618Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-07-28T12:44:06.255Z)

This is the document that I'm trying to get to. So this will summarize, you know, my acquisition expenses, my operating expenses, and I get down here. It shows the sales. And along with the metrics that are on top here, there's other return metrics down here and these are what determine whether I buy this deal or not. As long as these metrics meet or ex or exceed my investment requirements, I'm gonna buy this property. Right? And then the last thing I'm gonna show you here is we also want to make this a one stop shop for the investors so that they can also upload any other documents that are related to this deal. Doesn't matter what kind of document it is. Right? So they can create their own folder here. They'll be able to create collections down here and and group things. So this is how we want this set up. So that is the high level overview of the model. And now getting to what Vinod mentioned that, yes, when you get in here, and you start seeing things, there's going to have to be a lot of terms that you're familiar with. And and rather than going through them on the call, I actually have a document that was given to me by Diane, I think it was. Really just a definition of a lot of industry terms. So I will forward a copy of that to everybody. But the most important ones you're gonna see are for example, on the pro form a there are certain metrics that are kind of specific to hotels So let me start over here on occupancy. So rooms and keys, obviously, that's how many rooms are in the hotel. Available rooms this is the total number of rooms and they look at it on an annual basis. So in most cases, right, if they have 200 rooms, and they have twelve months in the year, take the number of rooms, times or excuse me. They actually do the they do it by daily. So 200 rooms for three hundred and sixty five days. That's why the available rooms number is such a huge number because they look at this on a daily basis. Because most people especially business travelers, might only be there for a night or two Right? They're we're not talking about just, you know, resorts where people go for a week. Occupied rooms, just like it sounds, right? So I might have 39,420 rooms available throughout the year. They were occupied 28% of or 28,580. So that's a 72.5% occupancy rate. Right? So these are some of the most common metrics you're gonna hear about. As well as on the revenue side You've got a you're gonna hear ADR. All the time. That's your average daily rate. And so how that's calculated is you've got your rooms revenue, This is how much money I made on the nightly rate. Right? So if I go to a hotel and it's a $150 a night, and I make 88,000,763 to get this ADR. I take this rooms revenue, and divide it by occupied rooms. Right? Because if I made $8,000,000 and my rooms are occupied 28,580 times, That means I was getting $307 of revenue from those. Right? RevPAR is very similar. This is this is per available room. Right? So this number is gonna be less because that's dividing it by this 39,000. And the the importance of that is this is saying, this is what I could have gotten if all of my rooms were rented every night this is what I did get because I didn't have a 100% occupancy every night. Right? So then, of course, like I showed before, you've got your rooms revenue, You can go down here, and this is gonna say, okay. Here's the total of my other revenue. So here's my total revenue that I got from both rooms and all my other operated departments. On the expense side, it's it's very much the the the same. So I've got my rooms expense. My food and beverage. You know, here's what it costs to operate those departments. In addition, we've got what's called undistributed expenses. And the difference being undistributed expenses. These can these are items that aren't specific to one single department. Right? This is something that would be allocated amongst the entire hotel or the resort. So you've got your administrative costs, info and tech services, etcetera, So you'll be hearing about operating expenses, which is the same as these departments here. Your undistributed expenses, nonoperating expenses, these are like your management fees, real estate taxes, insurance, that are almost beyond your control. Right? I the I I control what my real estate taxes are or my insurance So those are the three groups. There's so there's more groups in expense than there is in revenue. But those are really the ADR and the RevPar are really the lifeblood of the financial analysis of hotels, the ones that you're gonna be most commonly hearing, But there are other items that I will I will send to you as well. Know, that that have to do, like, with the with the data as well. Apartment class, you know, that's that's the same thing as basically the property type that we have here. So there's full service, which just like it sounds, this this is the hotel that might have a dining area. And a gift shop. And maybe a coffee kiosk or something. Select service might be, like, some of the hotels where you get a free breakfast. Included. Right? So there's not really a dining area or a a restaurant, things like that. Convention just like it sounds, this is a hotel that also has convention centers So convention would be a totally different revenue and expense source than the rooms. Extended stay, this is typically where the it's a hotel that's like an apartment. It has a little kitchenette in it. The rooms are often separated from the main area, and this is where people who might be working in a particular area for a few weeks or a few months on a project, stay there. And then all inclusive. This is like your resort. Where you've got everything included. With the rent, right? So these are the different property types that you're going to hear of or as it's shown on this STAR report, the class, which have had been changed down here for the demo. But, anyway, those are the the main ones, and Vinod, can you think of anything else that I might have missed You want me to go over some of these financial items? Yeah. Yeah. I think if I

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:53:05.068Z)

No. I think

### You (2025-07-28T12:53:05.555Z)

I think right now, they're they're probably

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:53:07.648Z)

you covered a lot there.

### You (2025-07-28T12:53:08.135Z)

their their their head is swimming in all of these things that they

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:53:11.558Z)

Yeah. If you could please also share that document.

### You (2025-07-28T12:53:13.075Z)

least threw a little bit too much out at once anyway. So that's why yeah. I'll keep it high level.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:53:14.278Z)

That would definitely help us all

### You (2025-07-28T12:53:19.325Z)

Now we get to actually developing this valuation page,

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:53:24.398Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-07-28T12:53:25.635Z)

I will want to spend more time to show you how these numbers affect the purchase price down here. And the relationship and you're going to need to know the formulas Right? So I think that's probably the best time to go over these items. So we'll hold off on that, but I will forward that document, and I think between that, we should have pretty much all of the information that you need. The one thing I didn't cover this waterfall down here, it's in the parking lot because I haven't developed it yet. I'm not going to take the time to put this into the POC. So what I'm gonna be doing is, I'll I'll put together the PRD and the requirements for this with an Excel mock up. So we'll we'll talk about the design and everything, but this is the last PRD that I need to, put together. For this project. All the other p items up here we already have the PRD user or the requirements acceptance criteria, user stories put together. So if you have any questions on those, you know, ask a node. You can reach out to me anytime. And, you know, be I'll do my best to help you. Understand why things are in here if you don't understand what the relationships are or how they relate. I'd be more than happy to help you out on that. So questions, anything that you want to cover yet today? Yep.

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:55:24.518Z)

No questions from my side. Yeah. I wanted to ask, So from that document, that we are going to extract the data So do we have to keep it, like, dynamic? Or like, we have some specific fields we want to extract?

### You (2025-07-28T12:55:46.885Z)

Yes. So for

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:55:50.118Z)

Like,

### You (2025-07-28T12:55:50.895Z)

for the

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:55:51.258Z)

rooms, rooms, rooms, food and beverages,

### You (2025-07-28T12:55:54.315Z)

for the MVP and version one,

### Guest (2025-07-28T12:55:55.338Z)

it's a venue,

### You (2025-07-28T12:55:58.555Z)

it will almost all just be financial data. That we'll be extracting. As well as possibly this market comps the star report, But for version one, it'll be, you know, this section in blue, Now this this example has four years, it could be one year, You know, it could be three. There's this is just example. So in this particular situation from the broker or the seller, we have four years of historical data. That we would extract from the documents they provide. Most likely will be a PDF. It could be an Excel spreadsheet, but either way, you know, we would extract that data. And that would basically be from this row on down. You'll have your rooms revenue, your food and beverage, etcetera. And so this is then used where where I would start forecasting. So if I'm the next operator you know, I would start thinking that you know, in 2025, you know, it might be '60. And then maybe '62. And so you can see as I go through here and I input these new numbers, it's it's going to calculate. And then this number so you can you all of the revenue is on a dollar per occupied room per year which is the same thing as the POR. So what it's doing is it's taking the historical number here of the revenue and then dividing it by occupied rooms. Right? So my occupied rooms in that same year. So in this particular situation, I had $1,000,004.86 and it was divided by the $28.08 50, that's how I got this $52. And so then the same thing as I input my EOR for my projections, it's gonna multiply it by my expected occupied rooms, which is determined by what my forecast occupancy is. So as I go up here, you know, I'd already gone through and done my occupancy projections. You know, maybe it's maybe I think I can get 77% occupancy. So now this has all changed. And if I come down here, this has now changed because now I'm multiplying 60 times 30,000 instead of whatever the the previous number was. I think it was, like, 29 or 20,000. Right? So the projections are all dynamic and really the one of the most important items here is how what what is my occupancy? Do I think my rooms are gonna be occupied for? And so you can see all the way down for all the historical years, that's exactly what it's doing. Now expenses are a little bit different. There's multiple ways. I could do expenses just like I do the revenue, on a per occupied room basis. So, you know, maybe I think I can reduce my expenses in 2025. So it's maybe $49. Right? And then, another option that they do is the percentage of revenue. And so what this is, is this is taking my room's expense as a percentage of that same year's revenue. Not the total revenue, but just what's affiliated with this particular line item. I think my expense is going to be you know, maybe 12%. Of my revenue. Based on my historical operations. So that's 12% of this $10,000,000.06 2. And then the third option is maybe I don't want it calculated, I'm just gonna input it. Right? So I can see here's my total and, you know, million $5.67 I'm going say maybe a million $5.70 Right? I can just keep going on. I can just input it. Right? So those are what's what's happening here is we want to extract this historical information. But remember, I I sent around yesterday evening an analysis that I did from what is included in the OM versus what we have in the model And so like I mentioned before, the broker has already gone through this process. To help them determine what they think the property is worth. And so we could also, when we extract this historical data, if we use the OM, to get this data, we could also populate the forecast for them. And so now instead of me as the user having to go through every single one of these inputs, here, I might just scan these items and look for them and either accept what the broker put in or maybe I think, no. I think I'm gonna get a 101,000,580. Million. And I can go in and and change whatever I want. There So long winded answer to your question is that yes. When we when we scan these documents and we extract the data, you know, we are going to be extracting historical in all situations. But our future state is to also be able to help the users by pre populating the projections as well. K. Alright. I know we've we've we've gone overtime here. I apologize. For taking so much of your time, but I wanna make sure that

### Guest (2025-07-28T13:02:15.138Z)

Gotcha. Thanks.

### You (2025-07-28T13:02:16.435Z)

you know, you know, you have to understand the business to understand how to code and develop the tool. Right? We went through a lot here So, again, I just wanna make sure that you know, if you ever have any questions regarding the business side, of what we're doing, reach out to me at any time. Just let me know. If you're not clear on why doing something or why it's being calculated in a certain way, I'd be more than happy to to to help out. Alright. Alright. Vinod, anything else?

### Guest (2025-07-28T13:03:08.948Z)

Yeah. Sure. It's

### You (2025-07-28T13:03:10.465Z)
