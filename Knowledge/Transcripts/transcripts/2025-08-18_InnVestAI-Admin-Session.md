# Transcript for: InnVestAI Admin Session

### You (2025-08-18T14:01:47.207Z)

Good morning.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:01:49.201Z)

Baseball hat today.

### You (2025-08-18T14:01:51.127Z)

Well here. I'm up at the cottage right now.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:01:55.041Z)

I love to work in baseball. Ad sometimes after I work out, like, if my hair is really crazy, I'll just put a hat on and then take.

### You (2025-08-18T14:02:01.287Z)

Yeah. Don't usually wear them very often, but it was such a beautiful morning. And spend a little bit too much time out on the deck having coffee. Didn't have time to shower, so.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:02:18.721Z)

No problem. Those midday showers are the best. When you're working from home and you're like, oh, the luxury of a midday shower is just awesome.

### You (2025-08-18T14:02:26.327Z)

Yeah, exactly. So let's. How's your weekend?

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:02:32.081Z)

Well, so let's see, on the business side, Mark had a really good day. Like Wednesday, I think it was. And he sent an email about this. He listened. Two things happened. He listened to the Deal Path webinar. That was last Wednesday. And it wasn't any major revelations. I was on it as well, but I think it was the first time he'd heard a webinar where someone is talking about a gentic AI and AI agents and things like that.

### You (2025-08-18T14:02:52.887Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:03:06.961Z)

And then second, a good friend of his came over to his house in the Hamptons. And started to show him all about unstructured agentic AI and voice. And the fact that he believes. His friend believes that typing will be obsolete very, very quickly, and it'll all go to voice. And so all of a sudden, on Wednesday, all of this started to click for Mark. Like, we're on the right path. We're doing the right things, right? But we really need to get the same message that he's been saying. We really need to get our arms around our talking points for the AI piece of it. And he said, and again, I'm really happy to see that he's engaging as much as he is. So that's good. And then we have Drew and Mark and I catch up, like, for a half hour once a week to talk about business development stuff on the hotel side, like, who we're reaching out to and our friends and connections like that. And so Mark and Drew feel very strongly that. And this is to me, and I'm happy. It's good feedback. That we need to have a DAC in place before we really have any more conversations with anyone. They would have preferred, I think, if I had had a duck in place for the conversation with. Monday, so everyone's name is escaping me. Jessica. That we had at five o'clock. But I still think it was. As well as it could without having a deck and having a structured response. And so the three of us are going to spend two hours today trying to work through the pitch deck, which then a big part of the pitch deck will become the client deck. And it's kind of like what I'd already showed you. Was it last week? Right. I've just taken the stuff you gave me on AI and I'm incorporating that into like, one or two slides. And I have all your pricing information, and I need to incorporate that. But I spent a lot of time this weekend trying to get the elevator pitch down more succinctly. And pull all that together, but we'll go through it today, and then Mark and Drew will chat, and then you and Vinod can chime in. But we're trying to get it to a point where at least three of us agree on the content and the format, and then everyone will sign off on it. Before we're finalized with it. So I have just. Because I have one call scheduled this afternoon with my friend Stacy Naldoni, who's at Western Alliance Bank. And it was on the book. So I'm just going to take it myself and just tell her what we're doing. They have a job posting out right now. And it looks like our platform could handle a lot of the things that's in that job posting. So I just wanted to tee it up for after Labor Day to do a presentation to her. And then I am chatting with my friend Mike Skiba, who is the person I mentioned about potential advisory. But I mean, we wouldn't be in a point to do that for another nine or 12 months. But he left his company, which was Taylor Bird, and so now he is striking out on his own. To create an advisory firm. That, interestingly enough, provides fractional CFO work, which we might be his first client, because we need a cfo, which is pretty clear after talking to Jessica. And then second, to help a certain amount of clients, not the entire world, but with their own tech stacks. Which I think could be really interesting for us because that would be going in and helping Petri Group with their tech stack. Right? Like, how does our tech fit into the tech they're using on the op side, and how's it fit into all the way up to Juniper Square? So I'm talking to him just to catch up tomorrow. Then I think I'm killing all the rest of the conversations until after Labor Day. Until we collectively get the deck in order and we all feel good about the content. I'm rambling a little bit more. I think Mark and I just have really different styles. Like, Mark is trying Mark, and this is all very good, right? 30 minutes. Make your pitch crystal clear. Right. You don't keep people on the line that much. I'm, like, almost the complete opposite the first time I'M. Talking to someone. I don't want to be asking for money. I want to be building relationships so that I feel comfortable. Both are awesome styles. Right. But we have to come together and figure out a way to just align on that. Right. Because maybe I'm going a little off the rails a little bit. And they want to feel more like we have a clear way in which we're deciding who to reach out to, when to reach out to them, and what decks or information we're going to share.

### You (2025-08-18T14:08:28.247Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:08:30.321Z)

And then the last thing I'll say, maybe a couple more things, is Mark and I still go back and forth, and I do think I might need to lean on you and Bonode a little bit on this, because, Mark, I keep trying to express to Mark the importance of accelerating the precede at least a little. Bit of it, that we need some working capital. Like, we cannot survive without working capital for six months. It's nice that they're paying for the offshore engineers, but we actually need to pay our bills as well. And benod and got a little frustrated with Mark because he doesn't even realize that the note is still working a job that's not 100% InnVestAI. So I'm trying to explain to Mark. Well, Mark, we need vinod to be able to have enough faith and security in this that he can come on board full time. And Howard and I have bills to pay. I mean, maybe you don't. I have bills.

### You (2025-08-18T14:09:31.287Z)

No, I do. That's why this cotton sale right now.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:09:33.201Z)

And it's stressful. It's very, very stressful. And then he keeps going back to. Well, no, you don't understand my pink tics. We funded too early, and it was a disaster. Somehow, though, we have to get to the point where we're at least raising 100, 150 something to cover some of our expenses. Because I think in Mark's mind, we don't completely fundraise until, like, March, and I don't think the three of us can survive until March without any fundraising.

### You (2025-08-18T14:10:08.087Z)

No. And that's kind of why, when I made. That roadmap where I broke it down into four groups and shared it with you. That's why for the funding part, I actually put your name on the precede. Exactly, because this. And I think it's unfortunate that he had a bad experience in the past. And now he's not even willing to consider it.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:10:41.201Z)

And maybe I'm. He's willing to consider it, right? It's just in his mind, that means six months from today. In my mind, that means Labor Day. We get on the phone with people and hopefully within 30 to 45 days, we have at least two checks for 50k or something like that, right? That help us get going.

### You (2025-08-18T14:10:48.487Z)

Yeah. That is the reason for the mvp. Because then we have an actual legit working product that people can see it's not vaporware. In order to get some of that early seed funding. And Jessica might just be the right person to talk to Mark about that, because she was talking about how they get involved with early stage.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:11:28.801Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:11:30.247Z)

Seed. It's a Series A, working as much with free tools as I can and came out of pocket on a couple of them. But that's only. You can't run a business on that.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:11:40.881Z)

I know. Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:11:48.647Z)

There's only so much you can do.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:11:51.601Z)

And poor Drew sits in the middle, right? He's like, okay, I understand what it's like not to be able to pay my bills, right? But he also has had a hard time funding. And I really do believe there are people that we can go to to get some small checks in September or October. I mean, we've already had conversations with some of them. One of the things I've been taught. Well, I haven't been talking to. I just floated the idea. And I photo this idea to him. Before I even talk to any of you guys about it, just to see if he would even consider it. Which is Carlos Rodriguez Jr. Who is the Driftwood is a family office business and he's second generation. He's the son. So he's very focused on technology where his dad wasn't. He is very focused on technology and I think we'll find this in the family office business and hospitality. I floated the idea to him. He has a few staffing needs. On the asset management and on the technology side, and I would say, maybe even I'll say on the product side, based on some of the things they're trying to do internally. And I've been talking to him about investing in InnVestAI and maybe there's something that we could do. We trade some services and then to help him on some other things, including Invest AI. And then he invests in Invest AI. If this is making sense. He writes a check for 150k that keeps us afloat, and then we do our work and help him out with a few things he needs. And he said he was interested, that he thought it was an interesting idea and to get some time on his calendar this week to talk about it. He's the only one I can think of where we could barter services like that. But I do think I've talked to enough people that. I mean, Peachtree Hotel Group said they would be interested in helping us try to fund that gap of. I said it was 170k, so I'm rambling here, but I feel like if we strike right after Labor Day and we're really ready to go. Deck in hand, mvp. Boom, boom, boom. And we just try to get two right. Two, three, something like that. 150k to help us stay afloat while we then do these beta beta clients. And this is the last thing I truly want to say is I don't remember if it was Amy or Jessica that said this, but the idea that we might on the Personas. We might actually want to try to have a beta client of each Persona. Early in the process, I had kind of been thinking, go just full fledged debt and structured finance hard and fast. But that did resonate with me that if we're going to have beta clients, maybe it wouldn't hurt to try to have a beta client at scale, right? Like someone again going back to a Berkadia a CBRE hunter or a bigger owner, or something along those lines where we have at least one client in each Persona that we're working on a beta with over the first six months. That's me rambling. How long did I ramble? 15 minutes. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-18T14:15:15.927Z)

It's been very good. So a couple things. That come to mind on the deck. For the pricing. Remember, the numbers in that paper are just suggestions.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:15:29.361Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:15:30.887Z)

So I think we need to agree. Honestly, I hate to say it like this, but I don't think there's any discussion to be had on the fact that we have to have a hybrid or maybe even an outcome based pricing model. I've got some more information that I'll send. It was really kind of an eye opening. Article. About? The fact that and it lists some very large companies like DocuSign and a few other ones that. Make a ton of money off of subscriptions. And then it's breaking it down into how much does it really cost for AI and why these companies could literally be out of business in a year or two. Simply because their pricing structure, when they charge, like, $90 for something. And a coder can come in and create the same thing. For $9. And they're going to undercut everybody.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:16:45.761Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:16:47.607Z)

So when you start reading this model, you think, holy shit, how are we going to make money on this? If we have to charge for outcome based pricing and as a fraction. But then towards the end of the model or end of the article gives a model about showing. By charging on. A per transaction or outcome based pricing, you can get up to 5 to 10 times the amount of revenue.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:17:20.161Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-18T14:17:20.967Z)

By that, it almost kind of sounds almost sneaky. But it's some of the psychology. It's like, okay, well, if somebody is paying $1,000 a month, And then you say, okay, well, we're going to stop charging that, but we're going to charge you, like, a dollar per this. And all of a sudden, next month they get a $2,000 bill or $3,000 bill.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:17:45.761Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:17:46.967Z)

And that's kind of what they're pointing out, is that a lot of these companies, to make that transaction, it's going to kill them or they're going to see business drop down. And if they can survive. Then they can go back up. But we are at the perfect point is that we haven't charged anything yet. So I think we need to probably. I'll send that information to you and Mark. And do. I think our deck needs to be. Like I said, if we want to include numbers as a reference point, that's one thing, but we don't want to say that this is what we're going to charge. As long as we can show the business model and how we're going to go about it, and we don't know yet what our costs are for this and we can go from that way, I would recommend doing that.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:18:40.721Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:18:40.727Z)

So that's one of the things that kind of popped out. The second is kind of going along with everything that we've been talking about now, so. We really need to nail down the LLC and get all this legal stuff out of because we don't exist.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:19:02.641Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-18T14:19:04.247Z)

Yet.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:19:05.201Z)

I know.

### You (2025-08-18T14:19:07.607Z)

We're just an idea on paper.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:19:09.841Z)

I'm sorry, Howard. I did spend time this weekend on it, and my mind was so, like, I don't know if you've ever been in a certain work mode. I was sitting at a coffee shop yesterday morning really early at 7am I'm like, I am gonna knock this LLC right out of that raid, and I started to read it, and I'm like, oh, my God. Watching Patreon, I'm like, I'll go to the deck, I'll go to the pitch to work on that.

### You (2025-08-18T14:19:35.927Z)

I get it. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:19:36.881Z)

Yeah, but I'm gonna get through it as I really, I swear to God. It's not. As Drew said, there's nothing groundbreaking here, right? It's just clean up and making certain elections between two things. It's all common sense. I just have to knock it out and make sure you guys understand why I suggest we choose one A over B on the optional sections. But I really did. In fact, I can probably show you the actual llc. I printed it and everything.

### You (2025-08-18T14:20:09.047Z)

No, that's fine. I think one of the things. Hopefully, maybe this week. I know. I wanted to schedule a couple hours with the team to go over the roadmap, but I think this would be more urgent. Than that. So I can put my off, and hopefully this week we can sit down and we'll have to block off quite a bit of time just to make sure we go item by item and make sure that we're all in agreement.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:20:25.361Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:20:37.687Z)

On that and get that knocked out. So along those lines. Had a couple of calls now, like with Amy and Jessica, where the subject of five Equal founders has come up. I don't know. How that's going to play out, but I think as part of this llc, we do need to have. Something incorporated where there are certain situations where we don't need all five people in agreement. So I think it's important that we designate which can just be. Done by majority. And what it would take to know unanimous votes. But at the same time. I've been reading a lot, and I don't want to send every single article I read to everybody because I don't want to inundate everybody. But I have read a lot of articles that talk about where you have to have differing equity amounts that have everything split out.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:21:39.681Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:21:55.127Z)

I don't know.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:21:58.321Z)

Now the 2020-2020.

### You (2025-08-18T14:22:00.727Z)

Yeah. Honestly, I'm certainly willing to negotiate because I would rather have a lesser slice of the pie of an ongoing entity than to have. Have the things sink because of some type of inner turmoil? Or unable to come to an agreement, and all of a sudden, everything comes to a grinding halt. So I don't have the answer to that. I just kind of feel that maybe we need to kind of maybe get somebody in here who can advise us.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:22:21.761Z)

Right. Okay? That would be an attorney, then, right? Or probably. Or someone like Jessica.

### You (2025-08-18T14:22:38.647Z)

Well, yeah. We'd like to find out more. Jessica seemed to be very concerned about that on our very first call, and I would like to find out why. And I get the whole dilution part because we're not going to get any funding. Unless they take that. So I think. I know, I realize, and I hope everybody else does, is that we don't own 20% of the company. We own 20% of whatever's left after everybody else gets there. 20%. Right. So we may get 75% going to various JV partners.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:23:09.441Z)

Right. Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:23:19.687Z)

So we get 20% of the 25% that's left over right. So I'm sure everybody understands that. You almost want to have everybody. Show of hands. Do you really get.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:23:32.801Z)

Yes, I understand that. I have read over and over that the pre seed capital typically equates to 10 to 15% of your total equity. So you're saving room for when the seed capital comes in and needs to then bridge from 15 to 50 or from 15 to 75. What you're saying. And I think the reason all along I have been very comfortable with the 2020-2020 is that you guys may think I'm crazy, but I do think we could get to $100 million in revenue over seven years plus. And so to me, this is like a really big pie at the end of the day and 20% of a really big pie.

### You (2025-08-18T14:24:10.887Z)

No, I don't need to do that.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:24:19.521Z)

To me is better than taking 20% of just a small little prop tech business, right?

### You (2025-08-18T14:24:24.407Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:24:30.321Z)

And help me understand, because I know people are saying five is too many, but how on earth. How would people do this? Because you need someone to work in technology. You need someone to work in product. You need some. I mean, like, what am I missing? Because if we haven't employees, they're going to cost more than founders are.

### You (2025-08-18T14:24:51.047Z)

Well, that's actually kind of what typically happens. You typically get one or two founders.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:24:51.361Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:24:58.727Z)

That are out there. Then you start hiring. And because you are early, typically what you do is you pay a lower salary, but then give. Some type of equity. And that's the question there. There are different ways of doing it. So you could do employee stock options. Or just like anything else you could promise them. We'll give you 3% equity, and you vest it after you get 1% a year up until year three, and then you're fully vested in. 3% doesn't sound like much, but 3% of a few million dollars is not bad. So it's just a way of deferring. The cost. But, yeah, most of the time. The other early employees are employees, not technically founders.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:26:06.801Z)

But then they'd be earning. I mean, maybe we'll wear. I'm having a hard time connecting is the hotel industry pays a lot of money to people in the investment space. Right. There actually is probably a 25% incremental between multifamily and hospitality. And so when I think about this, it's like, well, I'm not going to get anyone to. I'm not going to get lan Elliot to cross over. I mean, I'm not even sure I could get to. Well, I wouldn't want someone junior, right? Because I need people who know the people. So I'm just using lan as an example. I mean, she'd have to be 185 for me for her to come over, probably. And do marketing, Right? And sales. And marketing. And maybe help build out the legal. Workflows. We're not going to be getting people for 125k. They would be very, very young if we are. And I don't think. Well, maybe. I mean, but maybe I'm wrong. Am I wrong in that, like, is the idea you just go after young people instead of more experienced? People.

### You (2025-08-18T14:27:09.207Z)

It depends on the position.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:27:10.961Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:27:11.767Z)

So one of the things that I've learned is, okay, so you would be the CEO. This is your product that you've been driving for years. You might want to have. Let's not worry about titles.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:27:31.521Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:27:32.727Z)

But typically your first paid employer or employee would be an engineer. Not necessarily your chief technical officer. You need a person who can code and build something, right?

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:27:45.761Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:27:52.087Z)

And then after that. Then you start. The next hire would be your chief product officer, because now you've got a product, and now you need to have the roadmap and keep going, right? Then if you need to start hiring a team of engineers, then you need the cto. So I think we're okay right now because we do have the three engineers. We've got cto. But we've made the cto the cpo founders. And not employees, right? But yeah, the chicken and the egg, right? So you can't hire an employee until you get seed funding. You have to have something to pay it, right?

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:28:36.801Z)

Right. And how would we show anyone a product without having you in venod? Right. Because I keep going back to thank God I was as naive as I was. Because if I would have known what I see now, I would have been a lot more afraid to try to push this long on my own.

### You (2025-08-18T14:28:54.007Z)

Well, I think what makes us different is that this isn't a tech startup, it's a real estate startup.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:29:02.161Z)

Yes, please. Thank you. Thank you. It's a real estate startup. Yes.

### You (2025-08-18T14:29:07.687Z)

We use technology. For our real estate activities. That's what this is. So it's not another. App on an iPhone. Right. So, technically, in that scenario, the founders can also code, and they are the ones that get things going right. Then when it comes time to expand, they'll bring on the staff.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:29:17.281Z)

Right. Great.

### You (2025-08-18T14:29:30.567Z)

We're not that. Business model, so I don't think what we're doing is wrong.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:29:36.241Z)

Right? Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:29:37.207Z)

I want to try to put this in perspective. I think we're doing it right. And maybe Jessica's concerns are not applicable. We can overcome them. I just would like more.

You know? Goodness, you just nailed it. That's it, right? That is totally it. Because, like, when I worked at Clarion Partners, there were four founders of that company, and it was a really real estate company, right? It was four men that came together and they built an investment management firm.

### You (2025-08-18T14:30:01.207Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:30:09.201Z)

From the ground up. But there were four of them. There was not just one or two of them, and they were all very experienced. Investors that had come, they were number twos at other shops. Right. And then start and then launched out on their own. So thank you, because that makes me feel we are more of a real estate company than that. That is just bringing technology to real estate. But we have to know real estate in order to do that.

### You (2025-08-18T14:30:39.287Z)

Yeah. So we're not on the bricks and mortar side of the business, but we are enabling the bricks and mortar by giving them the tools they need to come up with valuation.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:30:54.161Z)

Y.

### You (2025-08-18T14:30:54.887Z)

So we're not inventing anything.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:30:57.361Z)

Eah, yeah.

### You (2025-08-18T14:30:57.847Z)

What thing we're doing is. That's why I was concerned way back at the beginning, when Mark was talking about IP and patents and everything like that. And it's like, well, we're not inventing anything. But we are tech. Enabling real estate operations. That's one thing that I learned at Real Page and can do with the utility billing is that we're not real estate. I mean, we're not tech. Tech. We are using tech. And I think that's kind of one of the reasons we term prop tech is that. Technology, enabling property management, things like that. So anyway, those are the things that I immediately, when you were going through here, kind of thought about is number one, I want to make sure the pricing is clear. I'll send you that. Information about the multiples, so I thought that was. That was really eye opening. Just making sure we can nail down the llc. We'll get that going and then the whole thing about the equity and probably I think we probably don't need to do anything other than in the LLC design. Where do we need a 3, 2 split? Where do we need a 5 0? What scenarios would need to be outlined, that's all.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:32:34.321Z)

Right. And then I go back then to the bigger focus, which is we need a list of 25 people. We need a band front of those people.

### You (2025-08-18T14:32:45.367Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:32:46.161Z)

Having these conversations so that they understand what we're doing. And it can be like in October. Yes. Let's write a check to get you guys in here and helping us. And I will ask if there are occasions. I'm sorry. Where it comes up, because I just. Mark has two houses. One of them is in the Hamptons, right? Just as living in a different world than thinking about, okay, I have a mortgage payment or I have to pay for my kids college or we have been eating macaroni and cheese for two weeks and things that I honestly never thought I would be saying. But it is what it is. When you start a business, right, you just kind of go back to poverty almost.

### You (2025-08-18T14:33:37.927Z)

So, yeah, tomorrow also. I've been talking to drew and vinod about a CRM system. Because I think one of the issues that I had last week was with the whole email. And migrating to aws. I think the process that was set up was done incorrectly, and I'm not blaming anybody or pointing fingers. I think it was just kind of an assumed process that when you have a button that says, join our waiting list, It should pop up a form. Right there on the page. And you just put in your name, contact information. And then click on submit. The whole thing about sending an email and everything. Totally not the proper way to do it. Because of things like this. And then that form populates our CRM, so we can start keeping track of everybody who's a prospect. And you track them all the way through the process.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:34:49.761Z)

I understand.

### You (2025-08-18T14:34:50.247Z)

So the two biggest providers out there are HubSpot, Salesforce, Salesforce is outrageously expensive. Maybe three or four years down the road, it might be worthwhile. HubSpot does have a free tier. But you'll outgrow that fairly quickly. Neither one of them have a good reputation.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:35:17.521Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:35:17.927Z)

If you look at their ratings, neither one of them have raving fans. So I did find another one. Well, actually, I take this back. So I found a template. For building your own CRM. And so I've been working on that over the weekend, and I would like to take just maybe 10 minutes in tomorrow's call to show it. I don't think we need all the bells and whistles. We just need a way to track who's a prospect. Who sold and then what did they buy? So I've got it set up so you can have an account name and then I've got the account type, so we'll know if they're a broker. Investor. Servicer, et cetera. We just need the basics. At least to get us going so we don't pay anything. This would be totally free. And then I sent some more information to Vinod yesterday because one of the things that people always overlook is you have to have a process of tracking people when they go to your website. What do they click on? What pages you, how long are they on the page, etc.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:36:36.881Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-18T14:36:38.247Z)

And there are two products, Pendo and Heap. Again, both of which have free tiers. But again, once you start needing more features, then it starts to get expensive. And so I found another tool that has been out for quite a while. I just didn't know about it, but it's open source. And free. And I'll send you a link to it if you want to take a look at it. They do charge. But according to them, 90% of all their users. And they've got some big names on here. It's like this isn't just some little rinky dink thing. There's a lot of big companies using them. 90%. Never pay a dime for it. It's just you have to be a really big company with millions of people on your website. Before you start getting charged anything.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:37:38.641Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:37:39.207Z)

So in fact, I looked and they're free tier. Is free up until, like, 1 million clicks. We'll probably get 1,000.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:37:52.001Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:37:52.967Z)

Anyway, I'm going to work with Vinod and I think we'll probably go with that because not only do they just track the users, It has pretty much every feature that Heap or Pendo has that they char an arm and a leg for is included.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:38:10.961Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:38:12.567Z)

So if you ever go to a website and you have something that pops up and says, how do you like this? Give us five ratings or whatever, that's what this tool does. And that's what the other, too. So you can have surveys that pop up. So especially in the early stages, instead of having to call somebody and say, hey, what do you think about this new feature? You can do testing on there. So if they go to a page, And there's a new feature. You can have this pop up and say, look, this is new. Howard. Here's the thing. Do all these things on there and get their feedback immediately. How do you this new feature? So between the CRM and that feature, that's something we have to have by version one. I don't think we need it. We don't need it for the avm. That's going to be pure testing. But I think we need to plan for things like that as well. So luckily, no money, right? Other than Vinod and the engineer's time to get it all set. And even that's just pretty much plug and play, it's not difficult.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:39:15.441Z)

Yes, that's good. Right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:39:26.087Z)

Anyway, I'll bring that up tomorrow. I'll send some information on this post. Hog is the name of it.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:39:28.481Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-08-18T14:39:34.967Z)

We can go from there. So I think that was the only I had.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:39:36.961Z)

Okay? Okay. So good. How is is Vinod? It seems to be coming along. But I'm not technical, right? So I don't really know like if it is or if it isn't. Are you happy with what's happening in the progress?

### You (2025-08-18T14:39:54.407Z)

Yeah, I think it's good. The environments that they're getting set up. But I have. One of the concerns that I've had is when he did the demo the other day. There were quite a few things that strayed from the POC and the requirements documents. So I had a conversation with him. And I understand they're just trying to whip up something to show. But the worst thing you can do is whip up something to show and then have to go back and redo a bunch of stuff. Because you didn't get it right the first time. So I need to have more contact with the engineers, and I just want to make sure that he isn't taking liberties to make change. Kind of goes back to what we talked about before when I showed what is a product manager. Product manager is the what and the why. And is how. So I'm not trying to. Cut anybody off from input. I mean, Vinod will always input. But once that decision is made on the what and the why, It's his job just to do the how, build it. Don't go Bent. Don't go changing anything. Don't go home doing anything like that. So that. That is the age old struggle of product management. Is. You are. You are the rope in the tug of war. It's something I'm used to dealing with. And. And he. He. He's good. I mean, he's. It's not like we're having any type of conflict or anything.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:41:40.161Z)

Right. You guys have worked together before, and. Yes. And so I know he thinks very highly of you. He's commented multiple times that you're great to work with, and I think we really appreciate that.

### You (2025-08-18T14:41:52.807Z)

And he's the same way. Yeah, we do have a very good working relationship. So, like I said, I don't take any offense or think that he's trying to go rogue. I just need to make sure that his engineers have access to all the documentation of the team site. And that's where I need to the whole email thing. We need to get them an InnVestAI email because I did share those documents with their Gmail but sometimes people are still have quality accessing the documents.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:42:26.561Z)

Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes Gmails can become unyieldy, too. You know, like, I don't know what your Gmail is like, but I have so much solicitation, like the Gap, and I keep trying to shut them down, and then sometimes they bring back up, like, weeds. It's like, oh, how did this happen.

### You (2025-08-18T14:42:47.367Z)

Nothing weird. Okay. All right, cool. So I'll continue to work on that.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:42:47.681Z)

Like weeds. Yes. All right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:42:52.807Z)

But, yeah, I think we're in good shape.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:42:54.961Z)

Okay. And then just going back in. Did you really think the call with Jessica was good? I thought it was, but I was also the one spewing, so I wasn't watching the interaction.

### You (2025-08-18T14:42:59.927Z)

Yes. That's what I thought made it most interesting, because since I wasn't really participating, I kept watching her, wanting to see her reactions. I do feel that she is honestly interested, that she's not just saying that to be nice. In fact, towards the end of both calls, I kind of feel like she wants to be involved. And she wants to have some type of. I wouldn't say equity, but she wants to go.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:43:44.881Z)

Yeah. I mean, she basically said that. This role comes along and it takes a small little piece of the equity, right? And in turn, she's a more active advisor, more day to day advisor than others would be.

### You (2025-08-18T14:43:58.167Z)

I really think that she wants to get involved. I think she sees the potential. Yeah, I thought it was a very good call.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:44:08.401Z)

Okay, okay. That's good. My good friend Carol Hensel connected us, and so I'm glad that that introduction worked out well because Carol was pretty adamant with me, like, nowadays. Come and talk to her. She's so great. So that's good. All right then we will Talk tomorrow at 5:30.

### You (2025-08-18T14:44:29.287Z)

All right.

### Guest (2025-08-18T14:44:30.081Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-18T14:44:31.047Z)

See you then. Bye.
