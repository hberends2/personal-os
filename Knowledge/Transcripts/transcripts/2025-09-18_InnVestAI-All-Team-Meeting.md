# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:31:03.595Z)

Hello. Hi. How are you?

### You (2025-09-18T21:31:06.795Z)

Hey there.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:31:12.635Z)

Hey, guys.

### You (2025-09-18T21:31:15.195Z)

Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:31:34.395Z)

I just reached back. I'm gonna be off camera for a few minutes. Hey, drew. Howard, are you home today? Are you at the cabin?

### You (2025-09-18T21:32:34.715Z)

But the cottage today. We dropped the price a little bit. Got another open house scheduled on Saturday, so today was my only chance to come up and get some work done. And then tomorrow, I got to get a little bit more work done than mo get the place ready for Saturday. So figured I might as well come up here. And knock it all out.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:33:03.515Z)

Open houses are never fun.

### You (2025-09-18T21:33:05.515Z)

No. Worthless so far. I think.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:33:14.235Z)

Yeah, that's been my experience, too, that they're not that helpful anymore.

### You (2025-09-18T21:33:20.315Z)

Doesn't seem to be.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:33:23.675Z)

Okay? But.

### You (2025-09-18T21:33:25.115Z)

But it's their time. If the realtor wants to come and sit around for two hours. That I'll potter tour.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:33:33.515Z)

Y. Eah. So anything that we need to know to go on. Maybe we should go later on. So, Drew, where should we start? Wanted to. Recap. Our call a little bit yesterday with Mike. But I think there's a lot to discuss or unpack from that. But before we go into that in detail, I thought maybe. How are you could present your product information. And I think from there, Vinod, it looks like you're out and about. So you're not in a position to demo to take us through the most recent functionality features development. But if you are, that might be a good kind of follow up from the product conversation. And then I wanted to talk about the budget. Yeah. I can give you the updates right now. Let's let Howard go. Howard go first.

### You (2025-09-18T21:34:52.955Z)

I was going to say. Vinod. What do you have to demo? Are you going to demo anything or you just want to give an update?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:35:00.395Z)

No, I don't have anything to demo, but I can give you updates.

### You (2025-09-18T21:35:02.875Z)

Okay. Yeah. Why don't you go ahead? Because we just met a couple days ago, so you've only got a couple things to bring up.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:35:10.075Z)

Yeah. Last time we were talking about extraction. Right. So I think we made some good progress in that one. We are kind of using a different model now, and we are having much better results. So, yeah, extraction is the key functionality that we have to knock out. In just these two days, I think we had some good progress made. Howard. Howard. And we kind of decided we'll demo, but I don't think I'm ready for the demo today.

### You (2025-09-18T21:35:47.755Z)

All right, so to kind of tag team on that. We did have a meeting with the Node. Myself, along with Raj and Siobhan. Where they gave a demonstration, where they uploaded a couple different financial statements. Both of them passed with flying colors. So it was extracting the data. Still have to work on a few different formats, but yeah, they made some really good progress during that call. We also went over the pro forma formulas. Spent quite a bit of time over the weekend getting some screenshots. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for the devs. So they don't know what these abbreviations and everything mean. Right. In the formulas. So I put in screenshots, okay, this is where this data is located for this formula, and kind of made it so a beginner could go through and be able to put together the formula. So make sure that they're grabbing the correct data. So they have that document now. So they're also going to be starting very soon on finishing up the formulas and the calculations. And that'll be for the pro forma as well as that includes all the KPI cards at the top. The key metrics, tables, the valuation summary and the investment summary, so we're in a good position there. Drew. Did you want me to share that PowerPoint roadmap? Is that what you were referring to?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:37:32.155Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be good. Even if it hasn't changed. I can't remember the last time we went through it. And they would just be good to refresh us on where it is as it relates to everything that's in Howard product document.

### You (2025-09-18T21:37:57.435Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:38:00.395Z)

What was the poll again? You guys use kava? Is that what you said or something else? Didn't quite get like you tested a new tool, right? So we kind of changed the model that we are using earlier. We are using Sonnet clots on it. Now we switch to haiku. Which is kind of giving us much better results. We are not having some quota limit on that which can restricting our ability to do a thorough testing. Okay?

### You (2025-09-18T21:38:42.155Z)

Okay, so here is my first attempt at putting together a roadmap extending out for the next three years. It's busy. But I tried to clean it up and put it in. A relatively easy to understand. So color coding. You can see the mvp. It's got this little light purple. And that really includes just these items up here where they're working on the MVP right now. Then we've got the beta testing and then we start to work on version one, which is the light green. And because of all the items that were Included in the PoC and the debt MVP, I added a couple boxes down here. So this section, really, to the end of this year, will take us through the development of the mvp. And then starting in 2026, we take some of the MVP beta feedback and then use it to finalize the Debt model version one. That will also include things like the risk matrices. Some additional reports. And while we're doing that, we can also be working on the Equity mvp. That will include things like role based access, exporting the data, and then we do the beta testing on the equity MVP and then we get the equity model. Down here. So in red you can see the progression. So we have the debt MVP coming up, the debt release in Q1, early Q1, equity MVP, and then the equity release in Q2, Q3. These kind of straddle the lines. I do not want to have any vertical lines here for each quarter. That indicates that kind of gives a message that you're locked into that space. You know, we need to make sure that we've got some flexibility. And then these gray boxes here are kind of the version 1:1 and beyond. This is kind of like our continuous improvement, continuous discovery. Process. Everything goes kind of in a circular, which actually is really kind of starting already with the version one, but I wanted to have some separation here. So that's when we get into the asset management mvp, which will be following shortly after the equity model one where we can move into that. Asset Management beta testing and then asset management version one released, you know, hopefully in 2026 Q4 or sooner. So one thing I want to stress is this is very conservative. So we have a lot of these things kind of push back in 26 Q3, Q4. That could all shift to the left depending on how these early. Projects go.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:41:58.475Z)

And Howard, when you say asset management in our hotelspeak, that also would include, like, in your mind, that's also very operational. Right. It's like the operational side of investment, including hotel operations. Right. Okay.

### You (2025-09-18T21:42:07.195Z)

Yeah, yeah, we can. Yeah, yeah, we can rename it whatever makes sense. Yes. So the big difference that I see between the valuation models for the debt and equity and the asset would be the asset would probably display a monthly breakdown. Right. So asset managers, operators would upload financials every month as opposed to the financial s that we're getting for the valuation. Which typically show the calendar year. That's, that's, that's how I've got it set in my mind. We can, we can talk about that, but there's a lot more to that asset management, because that's also one of the things to where we want to have them have the ability to upload a budget. So they can do an actual versus budget. Analysis. And they can make some changes to the budget or they can tweak it. But, you know, we can talk about that, but this is basically the role that we've got for the debt equity in an operations or asset management. And then you can see everything that's in the darker green with the black border. These are the AI items. There's a little straggler down here. The deal summary. We want to make sure that this gets out early. And so that's why I've got it here kind of aligned with the debt model, version one. And then we can start working on some of these others. And this is grouped by that paper or the roadmap that I put together earlier, which is based primarily on the difficulty and the impact that each of these will have. So the higher the difficulty, you know, it's going to be kind of over here. You know, depending on the technology we have, depending on the resources we have. You know, in house development, etc. These are some of the lower technical items, less complex. So, you know, the loan and investment packages, analyzing documents. OM extraction. You know, those don't take nearly as much. Data or, excuse me, resources to put together as opposed to predictive market analytics. Or real time market intelligence. These are the stretch goals, which is why they are out farther on the roadmap.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:44:46.555Z)

Well, those items also require more data.

### You (2025-09-18T21:44:48.555Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:44:48.635Z)

Right. And Howard, would you be okay? Because I see a real opportunity for us to do discovery work over 2026 on renovation and legal workflows. Is there enough white space that you could add two more boxes between where you have all that stuff? Google workflows, discovery.

### You (2025-09-18T21:45:21.595Z)

What time period? What time period would you want those in?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:45:25.675Z)

I think you can just put it literally under four boxes that say Automated Investment Guidance.

### You (2025-09-18T21:45:31.915Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:45:33.035Z)

Real time, just literally under the last box, which is video inspection.

### You (2025-09-18T21:45:36.795Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:45:37.835Z)

Right? Like, just maybe put two more green boxes. One that says, Legal Workflow Discover Y. Right. Just to show these are on our mind and we're thinking about it in our future.

### You (2025-09-18T21:45:54.795Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:45:54.955Z)

But there's still a lot of discover. We're just in the incredibly early phases, and there's a lot of discovery work to do.

### You (2025-09-18T21:46:01.195Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:46:02.715Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-09-18T21:46:06.955Z)

So sorry. I'm just trying to get this put together. So tell me again what you want to call them.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:46:12.715Z)

It looks great. Sure legal. Workflow. Discovery.

### You (2025-09-18T21:46:28.315Z)

Okay? And the second one.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:46:35.195Z)

Call it renovation, workflow, discovery.

### You (2025-09-18T21:46:38.155Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:46:39.675Z)

Thank you.

### You (2025-09-18T21:46:47.275Z)

Yeah, no, that's. That's good.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:46:49.195Z)

So can we just thank you for doing this? Can we zero in on just what we can realistically expect by quarter over the next 12 months or the next four quarters?

### You (2025-09-18T21:47:01.835Z)

Yeah. So I. I think realistically, the way that we've got it down here, everything that's in. I'm not even talking about the MVP. That's. That's a given. Version one. Everything in these light greens. I'm. I'm very confident that'll get us through probably mid to end of Q3. So by the by next semester.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:47:26.395Z)

Can we just. Let's just. Can we just. Let's just talk about 20, 25 first?

### You (2025-09-18T21:47:29.835Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:47:31.675Z)

So. We're going to start talking to investors. Soon. What can we tell them that is built. Maybe this is a segue to Vinod. If you take us through, take us back to the staging or development environment and show. But we can just. Because the chart needs to articulate this right? Because this is where when we meet with investors. This is really what they're going to want to talk about.

### You (2025-09-18T21:47:58.395Z)

All right, so.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:47:58.955Z)

And if they're writing as a check for money that they want to know kind of what they can expect over the short term. Right. The long term is just.

### You (2025-09-18T21:48:08.875Z)

Yeah. No, this is. Yeah, this is. This is a very busy. It's cluttered, but I think the easiest way to answer your question is this debt MVP here.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:48:10.715Z)

Fun to talk about.

### You (2025-09-18T21:48:19.915Z)

Is what we're gonna have to work with between now and the end of this year. That will include all of the items that are already in the PoC, plus the items in this box down here. So that's kind of why I put these here. So these are all of the things that we're going to have that we will be able to demonstrate to any investor as when we get this. MVP done. We will have beta testing going on simultaneously, but we can demo these because one thing we're not going to do in a demo, we're not going to go through a full underwriting. Right. Nobody's going to sit there and confirm that, you know. Oh, you know, you're. You're debt coverage. Ratio is off by a tenth of a percent. So functionally. You'll be able to upload a document, extract the data, have it populate in the model. You'll be able to create the deal and pipeline here. You know, input your acquisition, financing, equity and exit assumptions on the valuation page. You can have the market comp data. You'll work on the pro forma investment summary and investment metrics.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:49:31.675Z)

When you say you have the mark comp did. That be dramatically or that it's a manual.

### You (2025-09-18T21:49:36.795Z)

The one that we have in the. In the proof of concept is manual. But I worked. Drew gave me some sample LARC data, and it's pretty straightforward. I know. That's actually some of the first data that Vinod looked at. So getting some of that LARC data automatically input into here. Is something that we could add in here, but that'll be closer to the end. You know, once we get all of these items in there, then we can add, you know, some of the LARC automated upload.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:50:11.035Z)

Can I jump in and ask a. This is not. This is more of, like, a people question, right? Like, Mark's going to be at Phoenix and maybe he'll sit down and chat with Dan, who is an investor in larc. Right. Is there one quick, like, pull up of LARC data so that Mark could just literally flash in front of Dan Lesser? Like, this is what it could look like, right? Like we pulled the Lark in and it looks like this, so that Dan, as a visual person, could see his LARC data.

### You (2025-09-18T21:50:35.195Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:50:43.355Z)

Up very high, very important, and it is just making. So it's more of a marketing thing than an actual real thing that we'll do later in the year. But that would give Mark something that if he does run into Dan, would, you know, as Mark said, you don't want to go ask Dan for money. You want Dan to say he's interested and that might be a way to just. He sees his LARC data high up there and it's exciting. When is that going to be? When is Mark meeting the person? Well, the conference is the first week in October.

### You (2025-09-18T21:51:15.515Z)

October 6th. Yeah, let me talk to vinode. I've got two thoughts. Number one, I don't want to derail the developers right now and have them go and work on something else while they're still working on this, but I could easily do that in the proof of concept as well.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:51:37.115Z)

Yeah, that'd be great.

### You (2025-09-18T21:51:38.235Z)

So we don't have to worry about logging into what Vinod and the team is working on. You can just pull up the proof of concept. Very easily for me to do that.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:51:52.155Z)

And Mark when you're at the logic conference. You're not gonna have your laptop with you for the most part. Yeah. I think, realistically, it's gonna be hard to do a demo at the conference because it's loud and lots of people around, but I wanna be able to discuss what we've built thus far and kind of be able to discuss, you know, with some degree of precision. What will have by the end of this year. Kind of 26. Like, you know, the 27 to 28 is fun to talk about, but I think we really need to just really hyper focus on the next kind of four quarters. Right. You know, year out is kind of what most people. Focus on. Right? So, I mean, I think that, you know, if we could take this Char, which is well done, just like zero in on the next 12 months, this as be like the introduction. But then have another chart that zeroes in on the next 12 months. I think that'll be most impactful. Meeting with investors and users.

### You (2025-09-18T21:52:55.355Z)

Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up, because that's exactly what we're used to doing. Iq we had our big two to three year slide. And then the next slide would just be narrowed down, because then you can get. You can get rid of all the noise that's in 27 and 28 and focus on what we want. So, yeah, I could add a slide after this.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:53:08.635Z)

That would be really helpful.

### You (2025-09-18T21:53:18.795Z)

That'll just focus on the next year. Maybe. Maybe 18 months, if you want to go all the way out through 20, 26.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:53:25.115Z)

Yeah, I would go to maybe. I think we go to Q4.6. That would be great.

### You (2025-09-18T21:53:28.875Z)

Yeah. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:53:33.675Z)

Are you gonna have an iPad? My chance or tablet? Yeah, I mean, I'll have my laptop, and, you know, maybe I'll print out a couple of pages that I could just share with people. You know, not give it to them, but just show them. But my goal would be to try to get people excited about this and then maybe set up some demos, you know, the week or two after. But again, you know, I just don't want to over. And I want to make sure I have a complete understanding of really where we are. Yeah, I've done this. My tablet, my iPad. And I'd have up on that, and I could flip through it. And then the other. As far as the large data we need to do, that can be something we do in Power bi. Just upload the data that I put together. That three sets of data that he provided. Like Howard when I showed you together. So they're already put together. We could upload it into Power bi. Just in its own thing and create some visualization that we could publish. The marks I had.

### You (2025-09-18T21:54:38.075Z)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was gonna say, if you're. If you're not gonna be giving an actual live demo, then, yeah, mockups are the way to go.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:54:47.515Z)

Yeah, which doesn't have to be a market. We could be a live power bi dashboard. That.

### You (2025-09-18T21:54:52.155Z)

That's true, too. Yeah, you can do that up. Okay? All right.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:55:00.075Z)

Would that be useful? If you had a. I mean, I don't know if you've seen Power Bi on an iPad, but it looks very good. And we could have the LARC data there, where you can select your market. You have a couple different slides showing different ways to look at the data, and it would be dynamic, right? So, like, you'd be able to flip through, like, change, influence and that sort of thing. Okay, well, we can certainly take a look at that and see. But good in terms of just really. Putting it to perspective.

### You (2025-09-18T21:55:32.795Z)

Yeah. All right. I'll continue working on this. Not sure if I can get it done by the end of the day tomorrow with everything that's going on, but I can have it Monday. And so, yeah, if I remove all the stuff that's out there and I spread this out, it'll be a lot cleaner. A lot easier to read. Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:55:56.795Z)

Great. Thank you.

### You (2025-09-18T21:55:57.275Z)

Anything else on the product side?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:56:02.795Z)

Do we? So I know you have in here. Debt model, equity model, asset management. This is a probably question for Diane and Mark. That name or those names. Like those. Do we want to keep those? Personally, I feel like they're a little confusing. What are the names? I'm sorry. Debt model like Howard has in here, right? Like debt, mvp equity. I think maybe we say, fine with that. But if you guys have a better idea, like invest debt. Invest equity. Like put money. This is just for internals. I think maybe to say the lender MVP or the. I think Lander MVP would be better.

### You (2025-09-18T21:56:47.995Z)

Yeah, okay.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:56:49.355Z)

Because I think if you say debt, it makes somebody think you're right, Linda and BP would be better.

### You (2025-09-18T21:56:53.195Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:56:54.155Z)

Versus yeah, this is something for lenders.

### You (2025-09-18T21:56:55.595Z)

Yeah, I do have these pages here, and I've actually gotten lenders and appraisers, and I don't even know if appraisers really fall into that. Category or not, but yeah, so that's. That's really what it is. So you got the lenders and appraisers for the debt. Investors and brokers for the equity and then of course, operators for the asset management or however on my API. So I can change it. That's quick and easy fix.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:57:23.035Z)

And remember, from a monetization perspective, every debt deal or every loan that is done requires an appraisal. Right? So it's almost like a twofer, like for us to be able to go sell and get revenue. It always happens. There's rarely ever. I've never seen a debt deal that's done that doesn't require an appraisal, right? So we can pipe the same information to the appraiser that we can to the lender. And we should try to monetize across both of those revenue streams, because that's the fact that we keep talking about. Diane, do you think they do that as a conflict? If the lender and the appraiser were working off the same software. No, because the lender would make. The appraiser would make their own assumption. Right. It's really just the data transfer. Does that make sense? Like there would be wonder if they just conceptually working off of the same. I think just have the software load the historicals and the appraiser starts over without seeing lenders pro forma, if that makes sense. Customers. No, what you say is maybe. Like two separate brandings that get the appearance of fiction.

### You (2025-09-18T21:58:50.555Z)

Yeah, I didn't.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:58:55.515Z)

I mean, that's that multiplier. No, I get why it's good for us, but I'm just thinking aloud in terms of how we spin it to the industry.

### You (2025-09-18T21:59:00.715Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T21:59:07.275Z)

If. Can you show us? Go back to the Denver staging. Just show us. It's been a while. Current abm look like. What pages do you have? So I destroyed the staging because nobody was using it and it was just incurring the infrastructure cost. So now I just have Dev, but I can spin up staging anytime I have the infrastructure ready. I think that's good. We probably don't need it at this point. Later on when there's action already use. I had it up for probably a month or so. Nobody uses either. There's no point having it right now. Probably spin it up later when we have it. Okay, from the UI perspective, I don't think you'll see anything new, but I'll still demo it to you. Or you might see, because today I think Raj was working on kind of putting the action in the background. So when user creates a deal, it just gets created and data extraction can happen in background. Well, the data is getting ready, so let's see. What I'm going to do is upload this document. I don't even think you need to show. Well, I mean, I know more of, like, the inputs. And AVM features. I think as far as the. I mean, Mark, Diane say if you feel differently. But as far as the document loading like you work for, as soon as it can actually feed in and populate historicals in the pro forma template, I mean, that I think we'll all want to see. But that I'll have to go through the entire process. Okay? My address. While Bernard is doing this. We had talked a couple of weeks ago about. Through counter stations at the conference. I think we're ready, like, if that rests with you, Mark. And I think we're the three that need to sit down and determine what content we want on the website. And then Howard, speak up here. Maybe Carrie could help us on that. Vinod is swamped. He could do it, but he's really like, has just too much on his plate. But I think it's that you, Drew and I need to sit down and figure out what we want the website content to be. All right, so, Drew, let's just put that on our agenda for our next call.

### You (2025-09-18T22:02:12.155Z)

Yeah. Diane, just to clarify, I think. I think Carrie is very well qualified to help with the design, but I don't think she can build a website, so I don't know. She would really be able to take anything off of the node's plate.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:02:23.595Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-18T22:02:29.275Z)

But. The node. Correct me if I'm wrong, though, it seems like we could probably hire a contractor. That would probably be very cheap to just have somebody.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:02:45.195Z)

Design the website pages.

### You (2025-09-18T22:02:45.515Z)

Work with it or take whatever we design and just put it up.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:02:53.275Z)

I mean, we can design it internally, but if you guys have, you know, if you feel that design is not good, any feedback, you can kind of. Make the modifications.

### You (2025-09-18T22:03:07.115Z)

I don't think it's so much the design as it is the content. Right?

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:03:12.475Z)

Yeah. Content you guys can figure out. Let me know once you have the content ready. And on the design. It's just we want to make sure we don't overload you with work because we know you're already stretched so thin. So that's just. My main concern is making sure that you don't feel overwhelmed.

### You (2025-09-18T22:03:28.315Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:03:31.995Z)

If you please, can come up with the content first. And, you know, I'll see how much work.

### You (2025-09-18T22:03:36.795Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:03:37.195Z)

That would be. Okay?

### You (2025-09-18T22:03:38.555Z)

And keep in mind, we will probably go through 50 iterations of the website before we settle down on something.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:03:39.355Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-18T22:03:45.035Z)

So yeah. So okay.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:03:51.995Z)

The continuity. Let's discuss that. Cool. So I just created that thing again. This is Dev environment. I don't know what is the state right now. Again. We have the AI summary here, but not sure about what data is. Flowing through right now. My devs are kind of working. I don't see the data flowing in here. If I check in the database. Let me see. If it is going there. And see it here. But yeah, like, we have the. We had the X section 1. Probably there's a error in the application, something. I just want to see the interface. Yeah, Interfaces here. So we have that performance kind of built in almost entirety, and then we have the investment summary as well as the valuation build. Just. And even the data is mapped. So as soon as you know, we have that. In our database table, the data will just populate. So that's investment summary and various valuation. We have valuation. We can still work on some UIP part here. With pages are up here. It looks like. I mean, this would be ready for Mark Ban and I to look at not from a functionality perspective, but from a layout organization. Yeah, yeah, please do that. Go. Here, log in with your Gmail. And, you know, play around for a bit. And the only thing I would ask is that we loop powered into that conversation because Howard been. I mean, this has laid out like the POC is laid out. And so he is a good, like, bridge right between us and the, and the developers. But I know we spent a lot of time laying this out in the poc, so I, I want us to be careful that we don't, like, totally disrupt all the work he did and that we're in lock sync with. Him on that.

### You (2025-09-18T22:06:06.955Z)

I like the back of my hand, so. Which the node. One thing I did notice is we do need to populate the sidebar navigation. So instead of having to tap, you know, if I want to go from this page to a totally different page, right now you've got the buttons at the top of the page. So.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:06:08.155Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-18T22:06:23.595Z)

You click through. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:06:28.955Z)

These buttons? Yeah, we can move them here on the left side.

### You (2025-09-18T22:06:29.035Z)

Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, that's. That's. That's a very simple thing. And I don't. I mean, it. 's It's in the PRDs. I know. They just haven't gotten to it yet.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:06:33.915Z)

Yeah, yeah. Yep, yep.

### You (2025-09-18T22:06:39.755Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:06:40.315Z)

Yeah, yeah, we'll definitely do those fixes. Right now, just focusing on the data part.

### You (2025-09-18T22:06:46.955Z)

Yep, yep.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:06:53.675Z)

That's a good row. Mark, Dan. Maybe on our next weekly call, which is three of us, we're talking on Tuesday morning. We can do that. Yeah. I just really don't want to make any huge, major decisions without Howard input. Right on. On, like, the format and things like that. I mean, these are not decisions. These are just that we get to Howard. Yeah. Drew, real quick. Did you get a chance to transfer the payment to the developers? I think today was their kind of day. I did not. I will do that today. Okay, cool. I forwarded you all the three developers information. Yeah. Is the I'm actually on the dev site. Create a deal. Will it? Stay in here. If I created a deal, will it stay if I log back in with my. Okay? Yeah, it will always show up. Yes. Unless you delete it or redele it from the database. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, this will be good to review, the three of us. All right. Ben, I think I. So we spoke with just an update. For a bit out in Mark. Really Giant Ben and Howard and I spoke with Mike Sherman the other day, who was there yesterday. Mike Sherben. Thanks, Brandon. Diane. How's it Lawyer? The lawyer. Yeah, it was. It was very useful conversation. You know, he has a. He has his own business, so he's been through, you know. Creating your own business, doing a startup. And he's an attorney, so he had a lot of helpful knowledge. And when it came to his, you know, so there are a couple things. I think he wants to invest. And he's okay with the safe note. We talked about the valuation of evaluation cap of, you know, 5 million. Which he pushed back. Yeah, true. If that's all right. There's no way we can agree to something that's under 5 million. It's just not worth the 50k if he. I mean, it really surprised me. He's an incredibly smart man. But I think we're still, like, in the very, very beginning stage. And I know I use the word precede a lot, but we're past the POC into the MVP. And so maybe a year ago, someone giving $50,000 could have had a valuation cap at that, but we're now into evaluation cap, and in the five, if not higher range. What cat did he want? 500. Well, yeah, he probably would have agreed. It's five and a half million. I think he probably would agree to two. Two or two and a half million. Well, this is why I keep, you know, talking about the chart of progress, or whatever we want to call the work chart, because the more we can articulate the work, that we've done. The more value we can substantiate. I mean, it's just, you know, that's why that chart that Howard started the call with is so critical. Because it allows us to get credit. For work.

### You (2025-09-18T22:11:06.795Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:11:10.235Z)

I think, you know, showing that chart. I mean, Diane, do you think that Jarwood rather than eight with him? No, I don't. I think that he. I mean, he's my good friend, right? But he started his own business and it's a bit like Drew. He's a one man shop in the. ESOP business. I wish. Because, man, his legal skills are incredible, and he's very calm and explains things very well. But he doesn't understand the network effect here and how big I want to know that he did so. He. He wants to participate and be involved. And provide his legal and business expertise, which, on our call yesterday, was very useful. He did say he would take a higher valuation cap if there was some other form of participation. Like some kind of. Some kind of, you know, on the side. Equity that we gave him. Whatever it is. However many shares. How you know, half a point or a point, Some amount of equity that was in exchange for his participation. As an attorney. Basically a small business owner. Right? He mentioned the board seat, but I don't think he. I think he would take the higher valuation in exchange for some other form of compensation and precision, which his input yesterday was very valuable.

### You (2025-09-18T22:12:33.595Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:12:33.835Z)

So this is the same. That's the same kind of thing that Jessica asked for.

### You (2025-09-18T22:12:37.115Z)

So can I. Can I flip this around the other way?

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:12:40.795Z)

But yes.

### You (2025-09-18T22:12:43.755Z)

One thing that I came away from that call with is that every safe note we write is negotiable. So whatever we give to him, we do not even have to mention it to anybody else. So I'm thinking.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:12:58.635Z)

Well, yeah, Howard, I strongly disagree with that, because what's happened is that ultimately we're gonna have 15 safe notes. And when we go for our series A and our series B, we're gonna have to present all these deals. And the less consistency we have.

### You (2025-09-18T22:13:13.835Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:13:15.915Z)

The harder it's gonna be to attract equity. We need consistent safes, 100%. If we start doing special. If we start doing special deals, it's gonna be a disaster.

### You (2025-09-18T22:13:19.035Z)

Okay, okay. Okay? Sorry.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:13:24.715Z)

Yeah, and usually he didn't ask for it. Mike did not, but. And maybe Carlos won't, but at some point, people are gonna ask for the most favorite nation clause, which basically. Yeah. You basically say that whoever if you have a most favorite nation cause. That you're as good as the best deal that anybody else got. So we didn't put that into the template, but obviously, because it's very disadvantageous for us, But if somebody asks for it and says, I'm only gonna do it if I have a most favorite nation clause and we really want that money, we wanna make sure we have as few. We don't wanna hit you, sweetheart deals out there that we can't wanna give to anybody else.

### You (2025-09-18T22:14:07.275Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:14:08.475Z)

So you want the cap of 500,000? Yes, and that's not. I'm stopped that conversation because that would mean he owns 10% of the company. Yeah. That's insane. And I'm very disappointed. And because he told me he was ready to invest in. A week later he told me out of 500k valuation cap. And that was so inconsistent, I think. Yes. Initially said a valuation. Of 500,000. He was talking about how much was value. Yeah, he was talking post money. But not. There were multiple things being used the same terminology. I think it got confusing. I came away with the sense that he would be okay with a five million dollar valuation. Cap.

### You (2025-09-18T22:14:56.315Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:14:57.675Z)

Right, no valuation. But at $5 million valuation, cap.

### You (2025-09-18T22:15:00.075Z)

I heard the same thing.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:15:02.395Z)

If he got some other form of compensation. Got it. Or whatever in exchange. For participation. In the form of his small business as an attorney, which I think could be very useful. I appreciate that. Can I raise an idea that. Because I've been researching this all week. Drew, thank you for those videos. They were incredibly helpful. Probably sent me too much on a rabbit hole. But after hours and hours of research, I want to propose the idea and just listen to this, and then let's talk about it on the next call so that you guys can go research and absorb this idea. But for the very earliest investors, let's say the very first million dollars. Or maybe it's less than that, right? I don't know. Carlos is 75K, Sherbin B50K. Right. Maybe it's just like to get us through the mvp. What happens is they get a thank. They get included in a thank you pool. And a thank you poll is almost like imagine eight years out when we divest and we either go public or we are bought or something along the lines. And it's for billions of dollars, Right? And then it literally starts the cat stack and the distributions out. They would be eligible for payout a small amount. Maybe it's like a percent of that or something like that that is eligible to get paid to them. And that helps magnify their potential investment. So, like, a 50k investment could earn, like, 2 million out eight years from now, if we sell and we're successful and we reach all of our goals and things like that. So if you guys have the time, it's worth going into AI and just researching what a thank you pool is. And what I think we could do is just literally only offer to the very, very first. Like, if it's Stan Lesser. I mean, Carlos hasn't asked for it yet, so I'm not. Proposing anything he hasn't asked for. But if people ask for something like that, that might be the way we solve it.

### You (2025-09-18T22:17:17.995Z)

That sounds like a reasonable option.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:17:22.955Z)

The mike asked for that. No, no. But I just was trying to get creative. Like, all right, you know, what do we do, like, if people start to ask for special deals because we don't want to have, like, all these cut deals with people. And so that might be a way to just reward our true. You know, it's like, true. Truly like. Thank you for being our very first. And if we make it, if we're like Star and we're sold for billions of dollars eight years from now, you get to be included in that payday at an amount that is highly disproportionate in a positive way to your initial investment. Yeah, So I just. I just want to throw that and don't. Please don't feel like there's no need to respond and have to decide now. Just research it and we can talk about it later. Okay, I'm. Yeah, there. I'm sure there are a million different ways to go about. I guess, like raising money and giving side notes to investors, whatnot. I would say we try to keep it as simple as possible. Did he provide any rationale for why he thought 500,000 was the right number? Drew. You should answer that. Because, I mean, there's. He was very, you know, company with no revenue, no product. With a great idea. But that's. In his mind, that was worth half a million. Yes, 500,000. And he did say, you know, he used the example of when Apple was first valued. The first investor in Apple got, you know. 50% for, like, summons. You know, I can't remember what the amount of money was. I did point out that that was, like, you know. Inflation. That was like not very apples to apples, you know, 40 years later, the numbers almost irrelevant at this point. So I think after slock again, talking with him, using the safe, talking about a safe note versus evaluation and evaluation cap those of valuation. There were a lot of things we were talking about, and it was go. It was like. So I think. I don't think about the half a million dollars valuation that he mentioned is relevant anymore. I think, again, I didn't hear it the same way, Drew, but I. I was also. But you may have heard, but. You and Howard are hearing something similar. And maybe he would agree to a 5 million. I mean that's what I think we should propose to Carlos because I have to get a safe note to Carlos and I have held off I saying to him that we needed some more time to work on it, but we need to decide on what the pre money valuation Cap is we're going to propose to him. And research. Right, Drew, this is what you were saying. Research shows it's typically in like a 5 to 8 million dollar range for a company that's niche and high growth opportunity like us. And anyone that's being reasonable is not going to object to the 5 million. Yeah, that's what my attorney said. He's like 5 million again. You're in a. We're an AI SaaS technology. Like, it is a. It is a very hot, high growth. Thing to be, you know, again, if we were starting like a bakery. And by the way, I mean, it's really short sighted on these people's parts because, you know, this thing is going to work really well or it's not. And, you know, whether it's 505 million, they're going to do extremely well. Right. It's just a question of, you know, how desperate do they think that we are? But it's really just. In the grand scheme. It means so much more to us than it does to them. Yeah, I think Mike is a true negotiator. I don't think this is just part of the negotiation. So I think we. And the other part of what I. What sort of came away with in the conversation with him was that. We need to better flush out our budget. And our big, big, big picture expectations like.

### You (2025-09-18T22:21:27.595Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:21:30.395Z)

Between the five of us. So, for example. How much money do we think? Will want to raise, like, you know, or if we start making revenue and we can fund growth from operations, do we want to not raise, you know, do we want to raise less money? And try to grow from opera. You know, like funding our growth from operations. Right. I think that's going to be virtually impossible, Drew. I mean, just being realistic. I mean, it's going to be a couple of years. Until we have a product that's able to generate enough revenue to. Pay our expenses in full. I just don't see how that would. I mean, it's going to be a while.

### You (2025-09-18T22:22:20.955Z)

I don't think he was. I think what we were getting at when we were having that conversation is getting through a series A, which should get us through the, you know, the first year or so. Because, Diane, you sent up that information that you got from Perplexity, and a lot of those companies that you had on there were, like, already in the Series D, Series E, you know, funding, funding, funding, funding.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:22:46.635Z)

Right.

### You (2025-09-18T22:22:47.195Z)

And that's what I kind of came up and said, you know, I don't know that. I would want to continue funding and funding and funding. Over and over again. And because every time you do that, you're giving away a part of the company. More and more. And, you know, we all have heard the stories about the founders who end up owning about 2%. And, you know, Mike even mentioned it himself that, you know, he's aware of a lot of companies and after they get funded, And they get deluded. The C suite gets fired, it would no longer be part of the company. I think there's a lot of danger. And keep on funding series after series after series. That's. I mean, I'm not.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:23:39.755Z)

So we may need to have a. Like a buy sell component. We do need. I don't see may we're going to need to include a buy sell component. Buying the most. Work through this.

### You (2025-09-18T22:23:43.115Z)

That's what he. That's what. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:23:50.315Z)

Because we may all have different appetites for that. Right. Like, Howard, you may want out, I may want to stay. Drew might went out. Right. And so I think we're going to need to kind of sit down and use some industry benchmarks. To say, okay, most Companies essentially spend 1 million to $4 million on any kind of seed, and that's pre seed or seed capital that gets. That would get us through probably 2027. That would give us so 26, 2 years to try to get our ARR to 2.5 to 3.5 million in the first year, get it to 500k, and then if we can get our ARR into the two and a half to three and a half range, Then we can go for series A. And then series A would not nearly be as big as A, B, A, C, D, or E. Right? But you guys might want to stay through a series A. And then you may say, okay, I'm done. Like, I built this. I'm happy. I want to cash out. Right? But. Am I on the right track? Yes, part of it. But I'm just looking at. Okay, so we. This. If you guys look into my screen, right? We've talked about this. This is the budget where just through March 2026. I mean, we're talking about. Let's check in my math here, like by March. We'll have $66,000. Per month. In expenses. That that's what we're talking about, which is like. An insane burn rate. We would need onion again. That just seems like. And that's. That's with no salaries for us, Drew. No, no, no. That is with salary. Well, yeah, for you and me, but the others. Okay. We should be carrying that on this chart. Even if it's going into some kind of deferred plan, it should still be on the budget. That's misleading. That's fair. We can put that in. It has to go in whether it's paid or accrued. With interest. It needs to be in there. Yeah. The way that somebody, Mike pointed out that I thought was useful as far as framing equity ownership versus compensation in the form of pay. It is useful to think about it as far as how many hours of work are each of us doing on the product? Or, you know, to grow the company, right? And I'm probably spending 10 to 15 hours a week more than I would like, candidly. Versus like Howard, Diana, that you guys are spending closer to a full time job. And the node is spending, I mean, you know, a lot, but we want him spending, you know, all this time on it not working at all. So I think as far as the compens ations goes or the compensation goes, we should be thinking about as far as, like, how much work is each of us, each of us gonna be doing directly right now to grow the company. I think in that sense, Diane, Howard and Beno would be the ones that are gonna spend full time. Work on the company and growing the company. Whereas, like, again, I can't. So I can't do that anymore. I don't think you're gonna spend full time on it either. So, you know, if we did put some compensation in here, it would be. Less. And even if we don't take it, if it were to accrue, Yeah, we should talk about that. I think, but I thought that was a good way to frame it. And as far as, like, the mechanism. For payments. Mike also pointed out. Said the same thing that I've said, that using owner distributions is probably not gonna look very good to investors. He did, right? I mean, Diane, Howard, you guys heard the same thing, right? Yeah. He said that basically do a contractor 1099 is the best solution. It avoids salary. Right. It avoids all the complication of having to set up salary, but isn't technically an owner draw and that investors will understand that salaries salary isn't the right we're. Exactly. Because it's not gonna be a salary, but they'll understand that it's different than us taking true big bonuses out or something like that. Just regarding the idea of I thought that would be a great solution if it worked. I looked up. And you're not allowed. It's against law to pay yourself as a contractor. Oh, really? From your own company? Yeah. It's not. How is it? I mean, from an investor perspective. It's just semantics, isn't it? I mean, it's still money coming out of the company. Yes, it's all semantic. I don't see how you have that. The logic of how that's going to make an investment more comfortable. It's purely just semantics about. It has to be taxes, I think, for the most part, right? Okay? But an investor cares about what they're putting in and what they're getting forward and how fast the burn is, right? Those are the ways they look at this. Yeah. And I guess I'm thinking, like, if I stretch these numbers out here, Was the call with this guy recorded?

### You (2025-09-18T22:29:23.275Z)

Yes. Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:29:25.595Z)

No. Was it? Oh, the notes were. I didn't record the actual.

### You (2025-09-18T22:29:29.515Z)

I have the Granola notes and. Well, wait a minute. No, I'm thinking of the call that I had with the engineers. I do have notes. Yes, with the engineers. We actually recorded the screen, so we have a video of it, but, yes. I can send the notes. I think I. Yeah, I actually took. I got. I have pretty detailed notes. So.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:29:59.915Z)

It wasn't recorded actually live? No, sorry. Unfortunately, it was not.

### You (2025-09-18T22:30:03.755Z)

I've got the transcript.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:30:05.195Z)

Okay?

### You (2025-09-18T22:30:09.115Z)

You don't want me to take handwritten notes, trust me.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:30:09.115Z)

But again, so I'm looking at.

### You (2025-09-18T22:30:12.555Z)

Nobody's gonna understand. I'm including myself.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:30:18.155Z)

Actually, hold on, I got. If we can't do a 1099, then doing something like just trying that isn't that expensive, and they can manage the whole payroll process for us. Yeah, I think it would have to be gusto. Yeah, some kind of I need to drop. I might my daughter's school for some school now. Thank you, Vinod. Than k you very much. Bye. Yeah. I was trying to look up other ways. To pay yourself basically from your own company. But it really came down. Not that many options, I guess. Aside from that, though. Just big picture we're talking about. By Q1. End of Q1 next year we're going to be. At 66,000amonth in total expenses. Right monthly expenses. And I'm sure that's just in March. I'm sure April May is going to go up. Basically, what we're trying to get is how much money are we going to talk about reading to raise? I think it's $4 million by the end, and then $4 million, and then we start raising it now. And we then tried to go for series A in 2028. But if that, if we try to raise $4 million now, I'm sorry, in smaller increments, like maybe 400k dollar increments, like mark said, like we need to be raising in advance. Right. So three months. We can't just, you know, hope the money will materialize, so. But we do. Like 400k raises or 500k raises. With the intention of was probably going to stretch out to about $4 million. And then. And then, hopefully that aligns with 2.5 to 3.5 ARR, which puts us in a good position to go for our Series A. And then at that point, you're talking about being by the end of next year at what, an arrow? Oh, no. By the time we go for our series a. So call it 2008. 2028. So three years right to this year. 26, 27, and sometime in 2028, we go for our Series A. And we hope to have two and a half to three and a half. K, so 250k to 350k in ARR by then. Maybe in 16 through 17, we can get to 500k, which would be a good, like, trajectory, right? You hit 500k, then you hit 250 to 350k. And when you get to that range, then you're probably in the ballpark for a successful series, a raise. I mean, I, I talk to, like, a number of investors, and they, they were like half, you know, half a million in ARR is straight. But, you know, come talk to us when you have millions. We never really debate this now, right? I mean, it's just. No, no. We're going to be ready to do a Series A. I mean, we have no idea. Yeah. No, I'm trying to think about how are we gonna, like we're gonna use the five billion dollar valuation cap. To raise. You know, let's say 250, 350. Which will take us through to end of Q1 next year. And then we will use the next set of safe notes. Higher. Yes, that should be. Then closer to 20 million on the valuation cap at that point. What point is that? Like after the. Maybe after we raise our first million. Million and a half. Then when we start raising after that, we want to push up the valuation cap to minimize our. Yeah, you should have, like. No, no. I just don't know why we want to push it out, but how are we gonna justify going from 5 million to 20 million? When we start to get revenue or Beta clients or some traction on the platform itself. Yeah, that's my. To be able to go to. Again. Like what? What have we. What have we done to justify what? Drupaling our valuation gap? Are we gonna have revenue by Are we gonna have revenue by March? Though. But think of it as, like, today to the end of 2026, right? And let's just say that's 1.5 million. How much? If you add up your burn, which is too low, but if you added up that burn, how much is that? October, November, December. Three months plus 12 months for 15 months. Almost a million again. That's still way too. It would be a million of that. But again, we can't raise this much money with the five million dollar valuation. Cap. We would have to cut off somewhere in here. Now, do you guys mind if I. Because it's just too complex to talk about on the call, but I did a cap schedule. With fundraising. The first one and a half million, then getting to about four million, then getting to a Series A and taking us out eight years to a capital event. So if you're all right, I'll just shoot it out. Of course. It's AI Generate. I worked with AI on it, so there could be mistakes and assumptions. But I think it would be a good. I mean, for all of us to just look at it and try to understand how the numbers are working. And maybe we need to get someone to advise us on this as well, like someone who's been through this. I've been through it. Okay. Yeah. And I. Yeah, I. I mean, I've been through it multiple times. Then if you just. I'll send you the numbers that I did. And you guys just. Well, we can talk about it on the next call. And I'm not being. I'm not trying to be presumptuous. I was just trying to get it in my own head, like, what does this mean for us? Because I think going back to how we structure the hold cell and. The drag provisions and things like that. I mean, I've been super clear. I think, like, I'm in this for, like, a 10 to 15 year run. Like, I really want to see this to the end. And, Howard, you're right. I could totally be fired when series A people come in. But it is. You're. You have a better shot. If you're in a really niche industry of staying in place and a lot of prop tech investors, that that is proven out. But that might not be all of us. Right. Some of us may say, okay, we hit series A, and, you know, I'm good. I vested my, you know, my five years, and so now I want to cash out. And so we need a way to allow people to be bought out at a market value so that people who don't want to stay in it. Yeah, right. That's. I think you just have to put that in the operating agreement with Mike's point. That's fairly. Yeah, yeah. Put it. Maybe send around your cap table that you put together. I guess I'm just trying to think. Yeah. I mean, guys, let's not, like, whatever we put in the operating agreement. Is going to be subject to change. Right? Like when we bring investors in. They're going to say, like, this is not, like, friendly time, right? They're going to look at the operating agreement, they're going to look at our progress. And they're going to tell us what it is. They're going to do. Yeah. So I think, you know, that's just being realistic. You know, this is every time we raise money. Everything is. Is going to be on the table again. Yeah, well, especially that value rounds versus the heat round s. But I'm just trying to think, okay? We use these. This five million dollar valuation cap. To raise the money we need here for. Again. 250, 350, whatever. You know, whatever it is to get it. And then for the second three that the Q2, 3, 4, 20. We're going to need another. More like a million, probably. Yeah, so. What is going to be different, I guess. Yet like to Mark's question, what are we going to be? It's like market trajectory or we have interest or we have letters of expression of interest. Right. Because we haven't really talked about our sales strategy. We need to try to land some big clients, too. I think we do. Like, we need to try to land some big banks. Try to land. Like, I mean, I'd love to go try to go after Hunter because they're not affiliated with a parent company and have much more flexibility. I mean, I don't know, Mark, if you know Teague. I mean, yeah, of course I know Teague, but I think we're missing the biggest thing right now. Is the development pipeline. And the more we develop, the more money we can raise. And I mean, that really needs to just be the hyper. Like. Like all this stuff is really just. We're just kind of. You know, it's fun to talk about. But the the key to raising money. Is showing investors what we've built. It just. It's right and I don't disagree. And we heard it first, you know, from your friend. Right? Like, the more we go by valuations. Negotiating with ourselves. Right. It just. Okay. When meet with investors, they want to know what we've done. What we've created. What we've created. That's different than what already exists. And are we sticking to our development pipeline and trajectory? Very good. It's really. I want to argue with that on that, but maybe nobody. We don't have to debate it. It's just the way it is. Okay, but can I just rephrase, though, a different way? Which is when you remember when Drew said on Wednesday, we were talking about our mission statement. Andrew said, we all agree, right? This is our mission statement. We are going to build the industry's premier transaction and investment management platform. Right? That's our mission, and we're all in agreement. I think we do need to talk among the five of us about. Okay. What is our goal here? Like, Howard goal might not be the same as my goal, Drew's goal. You know what I mean? Like, what does that. Say. That just means that they might not have the same appetite to. Not the goal, but it's like. I think we agree on the goal to create the premier investment transaction and investment management platform. How are we gonna do that? Is it gonna be to go raise a ton of money? And, like, build it that way, or is it gonna be bootstrapping? I don't think. Obviously, we're not gonna bootstrap it because we're already going to raise money. We can't bootstrap. Bootstrapping means that we're putting the money into ourselves. Yeah, we're not gonna do that. We don't have enough money to do that. I think we've already agreed, but. I'm sorry, am I missing something? Because on the call with Mike, I thought you guys said you'd rather bootstrap than raise money, and so that's why I got you using the term very liberally. We're definitely not bootstrapping because we're gonna raise money, but it's more about how much money. And how are we trying Are we trying to raise again? I think we're doing this in a very. Difficult way. We need to build this product. And we need to show progress, and we need to figure out what it's gonna cost to build the product. It's as simple as that. Like the money has to come from somewhere. So we need to figure out how long it's gonna take. And then we have to back in what the people are, what we have to pay people to build it. Just like no one. No one's paying us for our mission statement. Like, the mission statement is great to have, but it's just a bunch of words.

### You (2025-09-18T22:43:38.395Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:43:39.995Z)

Like until we show people what we have. That's different than what exists today. We're not gonna get a lot of credit for it. Again. I'm sorry for being the hard ass here, but just the way it is, unfortunately.

### You (2025-09-18T22:43:56.475Z)

Yeah, you're not being the hardass. I'm aligned with what you're saying. Because honestly, every time we talk about Series A and everything else, I'm in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, why are we talking about Series A? We don't even have our first pre seed check.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:44:00.075Z)

Yeah, I don't think so either. I think.

### You (2025-09-18T22:44:14.795Z)

I think we need to. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:44:15.115Z)

But that's my point, Howard. It's like we're gonna think silly. We talk about, like, a hundred million. ARR. Ow.

### You (2025-09-18T22:44:18.635Z)

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're not. We're not even. We're not anywhere near the point about talking to that.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:44:23.035Z)

We need a product. No one's gonna pay us. A dime until we have a product that does something that they can't do today.

### You (2025-09-18T22:44:29.995Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:44:32.795Z)

It just. No one's gonna pay us for that. No, I. And I'm trying to. I. Yeah, 100%. I'm just thinking about the next. I'm not worried about Series A or any of that. I'm just trying to think, you know, how much money do we need again? Like, what are our monthly expenses? How much money we need do we need to raise for the next till December 2026? And how are we gonna get there? Yeah. I mean, that's. And, you know, and then I would argue that the next discussion should be, how much more money do we need to expedite the product? And, you know, we had two Howards and we had four of an odes. Can we do it? Faster. You know? I don't know the answer. I'm just asking the question. Yeah. I mean, we need. Okay, let's just. Yeah, we need to. We need to raise at least a million dollars to get us according to this again. Cause These numbers in Q2, 3 and 4 next year are low. So if they at least a million dollars. To get. But again, Drew, let's not forget that it's not just the million. Right? Because the people that come in now. Want to see how they're gonna get paid and what the trajectory is. So it's. It's not just the person. I agree. We got to keep it going forward and looking ahead. I'm just thinking. How are we gonna get a million dollars? That's the million dollar question. How are we gonna write? Like if we got. We start raising, trying to raise 450k, 400k at a time. In, like, six months. Let's just think like 4, 4 to 500K for every six months, and we try to get ahead of it. The 400k scenario sounds rational, Diane, but it scares the hell out of investors because basically, they're gonna. They're gonna see that we're gonna run out. Of money and they're wanna know then what? Well, I think we have to. I mean, yes, and that's why we have to keep moving ahead on this. I think I can conceive of getting 250. 300, 350. Thousand in the next two months. Three months to get us to March of 2026. Using safe notes that are at $5 million valuation gap, then we would need then we would again we need to raise from there another. You know, 600, 700,000 at a higher valuation cap. And that's where I'm thinking, okay. Those investors. Those investors. Can I just. What I drew. I. What I think we need to do. Is raise enough money now or try to raise enough money now. To comfortably get us to a point. Where people are willing to pay us for something. Because once people start paying. Then we're at a point where we can increase our value cap and raise more money. But the money that we raise now, the story that we have to tell. Is that we're raising enough money now to get us to be revenue producing at some level. Once someone is realistically willing to pay us for our service. Then we're in a whole different game.

### You (2025-09-18T22:47:36.955Z)

Yep. Yep.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:47:41.115Z)

So then the question is. We have to be realistic. We can't just bullshit them because it's not gonna work. Yeah, no, I agree. Howard, is that. March of 2026. April. Where is that? I don't know if it was on the product time. I think it was on your product timeline. But looking back at your slide here. Monetizing. The monetary wall was at the end of Q1, right?

### You (2025-09-18T22:48:10.235Z)

The milestones are where. Yes, each of those represents a point where we could start bringing in clients of a particular. Group. Right. So, yes, the first milestone there at the end of Q1 would be our lender. Team or ledger clients. Then we have our equity clients, investors and brokers. And then the last one there in 2027, very beginning, you know, could be the asset management operations, right? So.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:48:43.355Z)

But let's just. Let's just stop. I mean, there were so many lenders, Howard, that need this, that if we can get to that lender point. We could have a serious inflow of cash.

### You (2025-09-18T22:48:51.035Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:48:52.235Z)

So let's not even dream. Let's just, like, try to organize this. Like, if we could just get to that lender point where we really have a product. That makes Lender's lives easier. I think we could kick ass and generate a ton of cash.

### You (2025-09-18T22:49:05.275Z)

Oh, I agree. I agree. I mean, that's a huge market right there.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:49:07.835Z)

So let's not even, like, go beyond, like, it sometimes, if we can just, like, what do we need to do to get there? Do we need more Howards? Do we need more. Do we need more guys in India? Like, I think we should think about it in that context.

### You (2025-09-18T22:49:19.995Z)

I can answer that right now. Probably two more developers in India would accelerate. Getting us to that point.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:49:31.515Z)

Well, but having Vinod full time. I think is critical before we get more developers, right? I mean,

### You (2025-09-18T22:49:36.155Z)

Yeah. Yeah, I think. I think so. Since most of the people that he's hiring and he's really, really happy with Raj and shabam. When we were talking. He's had great things to say about him, but we need somebody more experience than Raj and Siobhan.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:49:56.475Z)

And would it be incrementally more beneficial if that person was local? So that there's more oversight, there's more direction.

### You (2025-09-18T22:50:04.075Z)

Yeah. So.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:50:06.875Z)

Because again, I went through this last time, and it just. It just. Again, it just becomes administratively really hard to manage.

### You (2025-09-18T22:50:08.875Z)

Yeah. Yeah, the product manager. That I am trying to bring on board. I think he. I don't think it's going to be a problem. So the budget that we have there for the product manager, he is offshore. He also is what you call product owner, which. It's a different term. But a product owner is really kind of a combination of product manager and. Vinod. They are the ones who get into the weeds and they schedule what the developers are working on. The node is doing a lot of that work right now. If we had that product manager on board, Who could then take all of that off of the node's plate so the node can work on the higher level stuff. That would reduce many hours of the NOAA's work. Little less pressure on him to go full time.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:51:11.915Z)

But he really wants to go full time too, right? So let's consider that right? Like, right, right.

### You (2025-09-18T22:51:12.475Z)

Well, he does. I do, too. Yeah, we all do. Right? Yeah. I would love to start drawing a salary and full time. I just don't think it's gonna happen. It's not gonna happen for a while. Would love to see that $5,000 in November. That would allow me get through the end of the year without having to dip into my high RA again. But I'm not counting on it. And I know the note is getting burned out, but that's why I'm saying if we can do something just to even reduce the number of hours he has to work on here while we're doing that. The product manager offshore based would take a lot of work off of his plate as well. So it is something that.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:51:57.595Z)

Is that. I mean, I had this starting, and we said kind of January, because over the holidays, like, how much is anybody gonna get done, right?

### You (2025-09-18T22:52:01.995Z)

's. Well. Remember? Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:52:06.795Z)

Or do we bring all this forward and try to get. We need, Because I think it comes down that we really need to have, like, by January 1st, like, we need to have. If we're trying to start, like, get some of these lenders to sign up and pay us. By March, you know, end of Q1, 2026. It's gonna take a month or two to get them on board and get buy in. Like, we're gonna need to have, like, a very. Functional product like in January. Which I know is, again, like I know. Like I'm looking again. I'm looking at the deb site. And like this is. All great. It's also just, you know, if we're 99% of the way there, That one that's not gonna work, and it hasn't.

### You (2025-09-18T22:52:58.475Z)

Right. No. So let's also talk about the holidays. The holiday s affects the US India not as much. I mean, they do have a large Christian population. But there are also lots of Buddhists, lots of Muslims. The availability of the workers in India, in India is not restricted in the month of December as much as we have here, so I'm not overly concerned about that. If we have that offshore product manager overseeing the offshore team. Much. It's not gonna be nearly the issue.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:53:51.115Z)

So maybe we do try and move this. This is 140,000 a year you were talking about.

### You (2025-09-18T22:53:55.915Z)

Yeah. Which I need to do a little bit of research may actually come in less than that.

### Guest (2025-09-18T22:54:29.035Z)

I guess. We'll put Mike on the back burner for the time being. Well, actually, let me ask this. What are your thoughts on giving Mike some amount of the employee pool equity? Right? Like we were sitting, setting aside 10. Whatever. 10% of the 150,000 shares is what we should set aside. Okay, so 15%. We're setting aside that for employees. What are. What are your thoughts on giving offering him half percent? To take the safe note at a 5 million dollar valuation cap and to participate. As like, basically as an attorney and advisor. I'm good with that. And then again, I would like to send this idea around a thank you pool because I think it could help incentivize people for the first 1.5 million. Now, I'm not gonna offer that. I mean, just. I'll send it to you and you guys research it, but it's, I think. It could be a way to help incentivize the very first investors when we don't have anything to really show. I mean, yeah, I'm not totally careful what that is. Maybe send it around and I'll read about it. Again. We don't have to. But this has to be a. I mean, there has to be. We all have to decide on. Think about that. Yeah. Again. I know we want money, but it's unclear to me why I wasn't on the call and everyone else was. But we could have that discussion maybe some other time. To offer that answer now. I think that this guy's being unreasonable. That's right. We should have had you. It ended up being much more than Howard notes. Again, why was I the only one not invited to the call? Because originally. Originally it was going to be just me and Mike. Or me, Mike and Diane. Talk about the LLC agreement. Just to go over the operating agreement, right, and talk about some of the terms, because he's an attorney. But it evolved into a much bigger conversation about strategic planning and his participation and fundraising. I guess someone could have just said, I'm going to just say we want to table this and do it another time. Yeah, that's fair. At a certain point, we did say we're not going to make any headway. With this because we have different ideas about where this is going. So we did table it at the end of that. Again, we're going to have to. Do 15, 20 safes. To raise the money we need. And the more special deals we do. A real problem. For future rounds. I've been there. I'm telling you guys, we want to raise money. I know we need the money. But we need to be confident in what we're doing. And tell people that we have accomplished a lot. And we've all been working together as a team now for seven months, and that's not nothing. And we should be telling them about all the great things we've done. Go from a position of strength, not act like we're desperate for money. That presentation never works. Even if we're on down to our last dime. We have to act like we've got $10 million in the bank. Yeah. And I think this is my fault for setting up a conversation with Mike where we talked about the LLC agreement and getting his input and his advice and his help, and then at the same time, talking about that. From the state to do it that way. So. My bad. Carlos again. I just think again, we need consistency, and I know that we need the money. Let's table that for now. Carlos is the next one who's agreed to get money. So I just like to get that you're safe. Note out Drew that you gave me the 10th of basic template with a 5 million dollar pre money valuation before we do that. Okay, Mark, because we don't want Carlos to come back and say, no, I'm not going to do a 5 million to really make sure to march point that we come out best foot forward or unless. Say no to a five. Is there any risk he's going to say no to a 5? Million dollar guys. It's all in the presentation. Yeah, no, I agree. I don't think he'll say no to a five million dollar pre money valuation. And so I'd like to just get it out because it's a very simple, safe note, and it's a very. If we could just agree on that one term, that's the only thing. I go ahead. If I could make a suggestion. Carlos hasn't, as far as I know. Met anyone other than you. And maybe he should have an appreciation for the greatness of the team. I'm not suggesting you're not great. But he should understand who's here. He should understand the depth of work that's been done. He should understand what our plan is. So that when we tell him we want a five million dollar valuation, have some additional perspective. Rather than just hit him with 5 million and maybe be surprised. I don't know. I just think we have a great team. I think we have accomplished a lot. I think we've thought about this a lot. We have a great plan. We have an investor. Deck. We've got stuff. And I think that that makes a difference when you're asking someone for 5 million value. Obviously, there's. Because I feel like. I hope I've explained this enough. They have an internal project called Domino, and Carlos is the only owner that I know that is thinking about how to take technology and deploy it against investment and tech stacking. So in this internal program that they're running, they have a lead software engineer that was in the crypto business. He's very, very good. Howard met him over summer. He has a data scientist. And he actually has this other guy that kind of crosses. And so the idea is I help him out through budget season, get him through budget season, and it's the equivalent of, call it 75k in his mind on a part time basis. And then in lieu of that, he gives us the 75k investment. In a safe note. He did this with something very similar with Revere and Mark Revere was acquired by light. Not like box. Light. Box. Right. I mean, Diane, if you think he's good. All I'm saying is that maybe if he makes the tea. I'm not suggesting that you haven't done a great job with. Carlos, because you have. But I just think there will be a time. I just think maybe we just try to move ahead, because I don't think he'll be surprised at the 5 million. And then we strategically set up a time where they talk about domino and we talk about invest. Right. And we look at where there's potential. Crossover, because the work they've done on Domino could really help us accelerate a true investment management module, where it's like calculating IRRs and cash on cash returns. And the work we've done could really help them on the AVM side. So it's incredibly strategic, and if this works, it's. A wonderful. What would you call this? Cornerstone? Capstone. I'll put in the 5 million. There is one thing. I want to check with my attorney. On the safe note. The wording of it. But let's plan to get that out. I'll get that to you today or tomorrow. Thank you. You can get that to him and we'll set up. Once he's agreed and signed, we can set up a time to talk with them. Got it. And, Mark, if you'd like to, he may be at Phoenix. I mean, there could be an opportunity for you to sit down in a nice casual environment and talk to him, but I just think that the team would present well. We should try to get in the habit of walking through the deck and showing them. The pipeline. And showing that there really is a real plan here. I just think that resonates with investors. We have a lot of good stuff here, and we should show it up. When Howard and I did the POC demo with Manny, who's his chief technology officer, who I got to know a lot over the past two years. Manny was very kind, and he said, quote, unquote, you've calm very far in a very short time. So getting Manny to say that was really wonderful for me to hear that he recognized the progress that we've made. That's great. Seven months. That's great. All right. I'll get staked out. And Tuesday Mark, Dan and I will review the dev site to look over format. Howard, maybe if you want to join that call to hear our feedback or if we just record it and bring it down and send it to you.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:16.475Z)

For the website.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:20.235Z)

For the website because that part hasn't changed a lot.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:23.595Z)

I have enough on my plate with building the product you guys run with a website.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:29.115Z)

Okay? No, Howard.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:33.195Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:33.515Z)

The deck is still not done. But as soon as the deck is done, I'll be able to take excerpts from that and give it to Carrie.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:37.835Z)

Yeah, okay. All right.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:41.195Z)

Yeah, actually, that's a good point, Howard. I meant this site. Not the website, the dev site. If you wanted.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:44.155Z)

Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah, I'm the surge. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:51.355Z)

So do you want to join for that call when we go over this.

### You (2025-09-18T23:04:53.675Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:04:55.995Z)

I think you should. Just because we don't want to undo something that we don't understand. Was done a certain way, I mean.

### You (2025-09-18T23:05:00.315Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:05:05.675Z)

Okay? So regarding the dec, I had not had a chance to do any really much more. But the format I think is. We agree on the format. I did add this. The slide is a timeline. This one talks about product features. Again, not finish. But I want these to be things that somebody like Carlos will be like. Oh, yeah, I get that.

### You (2025-09-18T23:05:33.195Z)

This is good. I like that. The slides you got.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:05:39.755Z)

Mark is this kind of resonate with you guys? Sure it looks good. I'm swamped. So if this is something that we can give, maybe Carrie, this and. Whatever that deck that the AI thing created. That we like the look and feel of it, but the content. I did not really like the AI program when that's what the content and I did not like it. Well, are we going to work off the deck that we did the other day? Yeah, this one right. No, the one. The text that we did with you, me and Diane. No, that's what I was just showing. Yes. That's what we have here. But this needs to be made into a professional looking. Right? Like, this looks good with the colors and all that, but the content that the AI Thing put into. This. I don't like it as much as I like our content here. I just. I don't know. We could just take the content here and dump it into that format. I think we'd have a great deck. Yeah, and I just haven't had time to do that. And I don't know when I'm going to. But if this is something Carrie can do, which I think should be very easy,

### You (2025-09-18T23:06:49.835Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:06:54.075Z)

Is that maybe cost, like you said, $30 an Howard, three hours, so maybe 100 bucks.

### You (2025-09-18T23:06:57.355Z)

Probably.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:06:58.955Z)

Give or take. Okay. I think that would be a good use of our because again, I don't know when I'm going to get to it. I want it to be done.

### You (2025-09-18T23:07:04.155Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:07:05.275Z)

Now. Right.

### You (2025-09-18T23:07:06.155Z)

And she will be on Tuesday's call.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:07:07.275Z)

So you guys agree? Okay? Mark, Diane, do you guys agree that that's a good. Yeah, sure. Okay, great. Cool. I will send these things to Carrie and I'll cop y all you guys, I guess. Just so you just make it clear that this is the text we want. We don't want to change it again, because I think we finally have a good agreement on all these. Yeah, agreed. Agreed. I mean, we can change the text as she gets the format of the template and the PowerPoint, we can change it as time goes on, But I think right now. Yeah, but for now, let's just go with this so we don't drive each other any further. Any more crazy. Okay? Great. Okay, cool, thanks.

### You (2025-09-18T23:07:53.195Z)

All right. Yeah. Thanks, everybody.

### Guest (2025-09-18T23:07:54.555Z)

Thank you. Have a great night. Bye.
