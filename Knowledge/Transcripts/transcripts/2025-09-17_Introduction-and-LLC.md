# Transcript for: Introduction and LLC

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:06:44.194Z)

All right. Hello. Sorry, guys. That's all right. I was looking at an email or something. Probably didn't have my teens up. If you saw, like, me looking around and stuff. No worries. The reality of virtual meetings, right? That's right. All right, so let me just jump in here, because I did this with Howard Drew, Mike Sherbin, who I call Sherbin because my husband is named Mike, and Mike and Mike are best friends from growing up in Avon Lake, Ohio. So my husband has always called him Sherbin, and therefore, it just is. Too ingrained into my brain circuitry. But his name is actually Mike. Right. But I just can't stop referring to Ms. Sherman. We're long family friends again. My husband grew up with him. Preschool friends in the same neighborhood are still great friends. Our families get together and Mike is a very accomplished. He's. Just a really smart man. He is an engineer and then an attorney, and he has patent engineering, patent attorney experience, and he has deep engineering consulting experience. And he's now started his own esop company, which I'll let him talk about in a minute. But he also has some really great things, I think. Mike, you grab a pilot's license. Right. I remember Mike Fox. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, he's really. It was a Covid hobby. It was getting overcome. Yeah. That's nice. And then Sherben, Drew and I have known each other for about five or six years. We met when I was at CBRE and Drew was first starting his own company, which is hotel biz. He caters to a small segment of our industry that's operational asset management. And so while may eventually we may have to really think about how we converge, our product is focusing on going at this from the capital markets perspective. So the deal perspective. But Drew is the smartest hotel data person that I know, and he's very. He's a great entrepreneur. He pushes things forward, and we're very lucky to have him on our team. Thank you. Great. And if you guys want to just say. I mean, I didn't mean to, like, talk over your guys. I need to bring Diana all my meetings. She makes you sound much more. Much better than I am, so. But. Go ahead. I say I'm glad to meet you, connect with you. And, yeah, Diane said a lot of great things. And I, you know, excited to work with you kind of via this company. I get knowing Diane as long as I have. And when she started talking to me about this idea, she always is very passionate about it and she gets going on it. Gets infectious at times. Yeah, I completely understand. My kids give me a hard time saying I'm a hotel dork. And so, Drew, you went through the LLC agreement, right? Is this a good place to start? Or anyone who jumped in with this. Yeah, well, maybe before we just real quick do that. I wanted to. I mean, Mike. Your vision for involvement with us. Obviously, there's a financial component, but Diane said that you're. I mean, you have a lot of skills that are relevant and, you know, like, what's your, you know, kind of appetite for involvement beyond that? So I, you know, I've always, you know, met with Diane throughout. For a while about talking about her doing her own thing, you know, and getting a business going. I've sort of informally coached her throughout sort of this process until she built this team around her of you guys, you know, and varying backgrounds, which is great. But, yeah, I told her. I am interested in possibly investing. And then also, you know, if there was, you know, sort of a spot on the board just to sort of give sort of, you know, and outside the box, outside the hotel industry sort of, you know, perspective on, on this and then help out, you know, help her out however I can. Okay. Got it. And having started your own business, I think that in of itself, that experience is very valuable. I mean, I'm now five years in, and I'm still learning so much about trying to grow your own business. It's painful, exciting. I've always had the entrepreneur mindset. My whole life. I'VE wanted to have my own thing. I finally got to the point where I could do it. But as Diane may or may not remember, her husband Mike and I had a failed business a long time ago, probably 20 plus years ago. Of starting out with working with a company out of India to have leather wrap controllers for the Xbox. And we had the prototypes made and we had them fitted. And Mike and I were probably the only two with leather wrapped Xbox controllers at the time. And just when we were ready to launch, Microsoft says, hey, we're coming out with the Xbox One and the controller design change. So Mike had a box of these leather things. That would only fit the old Xbox controller. All right, well, okay. Yeah, I think we can talk about that. More today or as we progress. But in that context, yeah, that's kind of what Diane had shared and why we thought it'd be good to talk to you about the LLC operating agreement. And Sherburn has seen it, Drew, and he gave me some comments. He was the one that suggested that we might need to work on the hotel piece of it because in my haste, I just hadn't been clear enough. And I know your markup has some things about that competing business component as well. Yeah. Yeah, we can talk about that. I don't think I sent you this most recent one, so I'm guessing you saw the original one, right? Okay. Yeah. So. And I. Mike, I'll send you this after. Some of it's for discussion. Some of it should be, you know, some of it may be like, a yes or no, but something that, you know, you might want to think about and read over. So for this one I added a schedule to the end that's pretty self explanatory. In this one here. When it comes to capital contributions, I wasn't sure if this was, like, something that we needed to have separate bank accounts for. Are you familiar with. With that. You don't need a separate bank account. That's just a way to track your individual sort of capital accounts within, I would say, let's say QuickBooks, if that's what you guys get started. You would probably each set up a capital account within your chart of accounts in QuickBooks. Just to keep track of it from an accounting standpoint. But you don't need a separate bank account. You wouldn't have a separate bank account because if you were going to contribute capital to the company, it would all go into your corporate bank account anyway. Oh, like a capital Gl account. You're right. Okay, that next morning more, which I think really only comes into play for you guys end up selling and you need to calculate capital gains and so forth. It's how much have you paid in versus what did you gain on the sale? All right. Further down. Feel free to stop me if there was anything else that you recall that you wanted to bring up. Just added the comma. Okay, so this is the carve out piece for Hotel Bis. I didn't change the wording. Just previously it said insert member name. So I just put my name Hotelbis. That's it. So the otherwise this verbiage here stays the same. Was that sufficient? Or did you think it needed to be clearer or stronger? No. When I first read it, it seemed that it was. It was too broad. You know, I didn't want, obviously, any of you to compete with each other if you guys parted ways. But I know there, you know, as Diane said, that you have this, there was a specific business carve out. And I said, yeah, then you just specifically list that to say your involvement in Hotel Bis is not, you know, obviously is carved out. You can obviously continue to do that. That your company. But we just, I just wanted to make sure that no one, and Diane included, doesn't, you know, splinter off and then start a competing business. That was not already in existence at the time. You guys have started this. Okay, so that maybe we add. Or cause this. This is a. I see. You said this is a. This is a carve out for my business does not provide any protections for anybody to go start a new business or join a new business that could be competitive. Right, Right. Maybe we want to prohibit that. Right. We don't want people to go out and start a business. But you already have one. And we acknowledge that decade s ago. Okay? Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's pretty straightforward to add. Here. I was thinking we should probably add a schedule to outline our roles. Is that something that you've seen in terms of documents before? I'm always for the clearer you can make things, the better. I'm a litigator by nature when I was in private practice and did lots of breach of contract litigations and patent infringer litigation as well. But I always see things like the worst case scenario, like if this was gonna end up in a dispute and the clearer you can make things, and the simpler, you don't have to worry about being very legalese with your language. The simpler and clearer you make things, the better. So if you want a table like that, like a chart or a bullet point, say so. And so's role is this and this and this that. You know, I'm all for that stuff. Yeah. Okay. I think we can add that pretty easily. Okay. And then vesting schedules. So Diane put in here a vesting schedule, and I think the way it reads, it applies to all of us now. And I wasn't sure if that was normal or if we want to do that or is it supposed to apply? Divesting schedules normally apply only to new members or new founders, new partners, new investors. There's really no normal. It's what. What you guys want to agree to. Some people are like, yeah, we're all equal owners right now. But the. The trend, if I won't say trend, is not like it's recent. But what companies do with vesting schedules is to keep the founders engaged. Because if you all sign it right now, And it. It is 100% vested. Everyone's an equal owner right now. And then again, my examples are meant to be worst case scenario. Howard just says, screw this, I'm done, and just goes off. And doesn't contribute, but doesn't sell his stake and just goes and does his thing. And you guys build $100 million business. And Howard going to say, all right, 20, you know, millions, mine. And you guys are like, you were never around and didn't help. But this is one way just to keep the founders engaged by having their interest vest over time. Howard. I know that makes sense. It does? Kind of in conjunction with the founder role.

### You (2025-09-17T19:19:06.214Z)

I was going to say. Have you heard something that I'm not?

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:19:14.834Z)

So it's kind of another tool to ensure founders are sort of participating in the way that.

### You (2025-09-17T19:19:18.614Z)

Well, I do have a. Do you have a question about that? Because I have been seeing a lot of things where it is also becoming more. Common to front load them, but maybe drag it out a little bit more. So maybe like 40% year one, but then drag it out to maybe year five. I'm not suggesting that we have to do something like that. Have we considered something along the lines of that?

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:19:46.914Z)

I think that is all completed up to you guys. I'm not gonna jump into. I think that's good, Howard. I just do. And I don't know what the. What the right times, but I think we have to have this discussion sooner than later.

### You (2025-09-17T19:19:50.134Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:19:59.554Z)

Is kind of working out the major decisions because I just don't want this thing to completely blow up because we have some personality issues and. Right. And so I feel like that's great, but we may need to really go back and look at the major decisions and make sure, like, going through Mike's view. Of like, okay, no one's gonna look at this if things are great, right? This is gonna get put on a shared drive and never looked at. It's when we encounter problems that we're look to this to guide us. And while it was my intention that everything be completely fair, because I truly thought that would promote great collaboration and fairness and a great working environment for the five of us. It is starting to appear that we all have very different personal circumstances and the views around that are causing some contention between us. And so one other thing I read this morning, or maybe it was yesterday, is that investors, when they look at that language in the major decisions that we've kind of drafted and we're all equal partners. They may think to them selves that we just took the easy road and we didn't want to deal up front with problems that could arise. I don't know if that's true or not. It was just something that I was reading when I was reading about how vast to set up. Owner decisions. Or major decisions is what I'm talking about.

### You (2025-09-17T19:21:37.014Z)

I've heard similar.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:21:40.274Z)

I will just say for Howard, you're initial question just put here.

### You (2025-09-17T19:21:50.934Z)

And I don't know if there's an advantage of one over the other or if it's just a trend. Right. I didn't really dig into it. It's just something maybe we want to consider.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:22:04.354Z)

Yeah. And I think, Diane, what you're getting at goes to this next section. The management of the company and major decisions, which. Well, this is the economics, but, yeah, major decisions. Were major decisions. No, I guess that was the further. Sorry. I mean, when we get to that section, we might actually want to run 15 or 20 scenarios through AI with this contract and just say, what would happen if we disagreed on this? What would happen if we disagreed on. You know what I mean? Just so we have a sense of how we would resolve that. Is it four or. Five of us is. It doesn't need to be a majority of five of us. How some of that going to work out, and is it actually practical the way it's been written? Yeah. So in this case, It's a quorum is majority of members. Actions may be taken by a majority of requorum is present, except for big matters. That require the supermajority. So these big matters are. I mean, this one obviously, is kind of a catch all. But one thing that I would offer is, and I agree with you, should have different thresholds. Don't require supermajority. And that might even slow you guys down in some decisions. Are just delegated to your different roles, that you don't need to seek approval of the others and so forth. But I would caution against having anything be a unanimous decision. Because then you give the power to any one person to just stop. Whatever that big thing is.

### You (2025-09-17T19:23:57.734Z)

Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:24:02.754Z)

I don't even remember. Do we have anything? That's unanimous. It's been weeks since I did this.

### You (2025-09-17T19:24:07.494Z)

When I read through the first time, I did not see anything like that. And just for the reasons Mike said. When are you gonna. What could you possibly need to have 100% consensus on?

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:24:22.274Z)

Raising capital as one learning, right? I even think. I don't even think that needs to be you. Now, I think four or five of you can agree if you need to raise capital or what you want to raise. I mean, there is an odd number.

### You (2025-09-17T19:24:23.574Z)

Well, no, not even reason. No. Yeah. The only one that might be would be the merger, sale or dissolution, right? But even that could be.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:24:42.514Z)

Yeah. I mean, we're fortunate that we have an odd number of founding members, which gives us. There's never going to be a tie. Be a tie, I guess. Yeah.

### You (2025-09-17T19:24:51.414Z)

Right. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:24:52.994Z)

As long as everybody participates. And this may only. This agreement may only be in effect. Through your until you guys do a formal Series A. Because any, any investor might come in and change it and say, they may say, well, InnVestAI. I'll fund your whole Series A. But I want two board seats or I want this or that. They're gonna. They're gonna demand concessions. And any investment in any round of series, round of raising capital. All right, so this part meeting seems clear. Member actions. Okay, so actions requiring unanimous consent, so. Am I reading this correctly? That one. Those things listed the way I'm reading it, probably the same way you're reading it. Those things listed require all five of you to agree. That's. That's what you need. Unanimous. Voting for. Even though it's says up here, big matters require supermajority. This is just which it kind of lists the same things. Arraignments, amendments.

### You (2025-09-17T19:26:20.214Z)

There's a couple of conflicts there with a dissolution.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:26:28.514Z)

Yeah, I think it might be.

### You (2025-09-17T19:26:28.694Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:26:35.554Z)

Okay, we have to look over this section here. Well, these are just for meetings. This seems. Okay. Okay. But I think, like, to your point. Yeah, I agree. It looks like there's some conflicts. I would. The meeting section. I would just probably word it to what meetings required, just a quorum of three. And what meetings require a supermajority, so you can't have a meeting to discuss. Something that an act. And then under the actions, these are the action. We can only take action if we have these level of votes.

### You (2025-09-17T19:27:10.454Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:27:16.434Z)

So it's like you can't even meet to discuss something that would take a supermajority to resolve. Therefore, like, three of you can't sort of collude against the other two or so unless you have this super, almost super quorum, if you will, like.

### You (2025-09-17T19:27:31.174Z)

Okay? That makes sense. Yeah. Okay.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:27:43.554Z)

You can always hate that. I sound like you guys are all gonna backstab each other, but I'm not. That's not my intent when I throw this stuff up. No, that's. That's. That's as. That's good. You're. You're looking through it from the worst. Lens, right? And that's what we need to do. Is have this help us if we run into conflict.

### You (2025-09-17T19:28:02.374Z)

Yeah. Expect the best, prepare for the worst.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:28:11.234Z)

Bankruptcy. That. I don't know if I would require you. That's almost gonna take care of itself, right? You either will or won't have enough money to pay your bills.

### You (2025-09-17T19:28:19.894Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:28:22.514Z)

Okay, so. But this. But this perhaps is where we need to move this. Yeah, I think almost all those would be super majority or four out of five of you. Because, again, if it's not working out and you guys want to dissolve and go your second ways, You don't want like one person saying no pe. I'm forcing this company to stay in existence because I'm. I refuse to consent to the dissolution. Yeah, makes sense. And then perhaps. We add a section that. I mean, maybe this is. Might be more work than it's worth, but say that certain activities or decisions can be made by individual members according to their roles. I mean, that sounds. I imagine you could add a ton of clarifications on that, but that also means a whole ton more work in writing. I don't know if we necessarily. I'll put a note here and we can think about it. Because right now, at this point, what's going on practically, is there. We're meeting twice a week, the five of us, and so it kind of feels like we all have input. But at some point, we are going to need to, like, start to roll more into what our functional roles are and have more say. I mean, maybe Drew and Howard, you guys don't agree with that, but I feel like in a year and a half, and I. I'm very optimistic when this is doing quite well. And we're expanding rapidly. That we're all going to be kind of really working in our swim lane, and we, you know, we won't be where we are today with all five of us chiming in on the smallest of items. This is a reminder.

### You (2025-09-17T19:30:04.614Z)

You're right. You're right. I mean, we're gonna have to have independence in terms of staffing.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:30:06.194Z)

Turn on the dishwasher.

### You (2025-09-17T19:30:11.654Z)

Tools, equipment. I mean, yeah, there are things that we definitely do not. I mean, I don't want to become.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:30:15.874Z)

This is a reminder. Turn on the dishwasher.

### You (2025-09-17T19:30:19.254Z)

Administrative heavy.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:30:21.714Z)

Perhaps the easiest way to do this.

### You (2025-09-17T19:30:22.294Z)

We have to have leeway to do our jobs.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:30:25.954Z)

Perhaps the way to do this is that when we will have a separate schedule. Right. Like I said at the beginning, that there would be a separate schedule or exhibit that would be related to our roles. Right. And that is where we could dictate who, you know, who's going to be used, broadly speaking, responsible for what. Even at the company I used to join, we had a. It was called a delegation authority policy that the board then would adopt and approve. So you would lay out, you know, general counsel had authority to settle cases up to $100,000. Or CFO had authority to spend, you know, make expenses up to, like, 300. Thousand dollars. And then above that was the seat. Anything above that needed CEO consent. And the CEO had up to, you know, let's just say a million dollars. And above that, they needed to go to the actual board of directors to get authority to do so. You would set levels of authority because you don't want if you're going to buy a laptop or a couple thousand dollars, you won't have to convene a meeting of all five of you. Can I buy a laptop, you know, or whatever. But if someone's going to invest in, you know, sign a contract that's going to bind the company to first. Who has authority to assign to sign contracts on behalf of the authority is also something you want to delegate. And then what are those limits? Contracts over X number of dollars or X length and time? You know, may need approval of the board and so forth. Yeah, I did. Somewhere in there, there was a section about everybody being bound by decisions. Of an individual. And I said, you know, we should. That should only be obviously such that that decision does not violate the terms of the agreement. So. But I think including that in. Too far. In this section where we talk about the founders, like, rules and responsibilities make sense. Okay? And then.

### You (2025-09-17T19:32:34.054Z)

Just letting you know the product team does require Aston Martin.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:32:34.194Z)

Okay, so we talk about. That's usually typical in the. It's. Obviously. Honestly. Oh, and. Hey, Sherman, I'm just making. Are you okay to go past the half hour? I know we're late. Okay. Okay, we're talking about vesting front loading. Okay, should we. Okay, should we appoint ourselves managers versus running the businesses? Members? That was something. I don't think that's a big deal either way, Mike. But does it make a difference if we are, like, assign ourselves managers and run the company that way versus just running it as members? I don't think so. Usually it's my, my thought was, you know, cause there's member managed LLCs and then manage is usually when the members don't have time to run it, they maybe appoint a manager, you know, and then you can make the decisions like it's more of a hands. Off type relationship. But as active as you guys are, I would just do member manage like you guys are. Yeah, so I figured. Okay? So under the comp and draws and deferred comp. My take is there's a couple, there's. A couple, they're definitely separate. So when it comes to draws, right, that's. I mean, that's how. In my. My company now. And it. My company's not big. It's me. I mean, I run it through an llc, but I don't. I'm not a salaried employee. I don't have a W2 at the end of the year. I just take a draw out of the company every month and then once a quarter pay my estimated taxes based on my the profit of the company, whether I drew it or not is what you guys would be taxed on and then estimated quarterly basis. So once you get up and running. Hopefully you guys are profitable. And it's that profit every quarter that you're gonna have to pay estimated taxes on. So let's say you're $100,000 this quarter, profitable. And you guys took no draw, no salary, because you guys had side jobs and you just kept everything in the company. Each of you, though, will be based on your ownership percentages. And keep it simple. You're all 20% owners, let's say before any dilution. You will all be required to pay estimated quarterly taxes on your $20,000 share of that profit. And so then you'll need to take more than likely a draw out of the out of the company to pay. Let's say the taxes are $6,000 on the that you're gonna pay towards the estimate. Then each of you would take a draw of $6,000 to send to the IRS. But that's still a company draw or an owner draw. They don't. Owner draws aren't differentiated between I took it out to go buy a boat or I took it out to pay SMA quarterly taxes. It's all treated the same. It's just the owner taking out money. Compensation is I'm a W2 employee of the company. And I'm running it through ADP or some payroll, QuickBooks, payroll provider. And here's my salary, and there's withholding taxes and all that stuff. So typically, what I see is sort of the way that I run is just as long as it's just me, and it will be until February. That's what I'm hiring my first person. I'm just taking a draw. When I hire someone, that person will be a W2 employee with compensation and a payroll. But I'll still just take a draw whenever. And so that's sort of how you guys, when it comes to draws, you usually should take agree on when the draw comes and do it equally. That way you're not like, hey, so and so was taking more money out than they should. Draw should be okay. But if you now want to assign, hey, so and so is actually working for the company, but the rest of us have side jobs. Or two people are working. Like, Vinod, I know is doing a lot of work for the company. Like maybe like, okay, we need to pay Vinod maybe a salary because. He's working for the company. That's in addition to his owner draw. Like, that's just value he's adding as an employee. So that's how I see like the decisions you guys have to make with those who are actually working day to day on the getting this company off the ground may be entitled to compensation in addition to just which are write offs of the company, which take down profitability of the company, obviously, which then reduce your tax. Liability. And then you guys can take the draws equally, usually to pay company taxes or quarterly taxes. Or if you guys decide, like, hey, we're keeping two, let's fast forward, or you guys are wildly successful. We're keeping too much money in here. We don't need to have this much money in the bank account. Let's take a quarterly bonus or a quarterly draw just for us, you know, and take that out. Those are issues you guys will need. This is one of the very contentious issues that we're dealing with. And, well, Drew and Howard know that I'm probably more emotional about this, and so, Drew and Howard, I'm gonna turn it over to you. Can you guys describe to Mike kind of what we're grappling with, and then let's brainstorm on how best to handle it? Yeah. Essentially, the five of us, yeah, or estais that earlier, are in very different economic circumstances. Some of us are working, some of us are not. Some of us need money, some of us don't. So we're trying to figure out the best way to incorporate. I guess between the five of us, there are differences. Different agreement, different thoughts about what the company's role in that is, right? Do us founders get paid earlier? Now, do we not? How much and how do we get paid? So those are questions which we have. It's been as bit contentious. And keeping in mind that the company doesn't have any money at this point, you and one other have agreed to invest. Mark, one of the other founders and I have contributed a little bit to get things going. But there isn't a ton of money. Right. And we have a lot of, you know, we've been putting our budget month by month and building that up and kind of getting a better sense of what our fundraising needs are. So I guess the question a couple questions that come from that is. Well, I guess one of maybe the simpler ones is how best do we. Compensate. The founders that are gonna start working for the company full time. Or more full time than others. Is the best way to do that. And owner draw is it? One of my attorney had suggested a way to do that as a loan against the company. Or from the company. I guess it's like, can be paid back with conversions. Or distributions when they happen. And then, of course, there are other ways is, you know, salary. W2. Right. So, like, what's the way that we should be thinking about that? So my. My personal thought is this. I'm of the mindset of doing the compensation model. And it may not have to be a W2. If you don't want to engage. And I would. And maybe I wouldn't engage, you know, in the payroll provider yet, you know, and go through that complication of submitting withholding taxes to the state and the IRS and also workers comp. And I would not set it up as a W2 employee. Yet. What I would do is have the person working for the company be a contractor, a vendor. Pay them on a 1099 basis, basically, if that's allowed, and just you're. The company's gonna pay them, let's say, a gross salary of that. Amount of money or compensation, I won't even call a salary. But of that amount of money, it's on that person. Contractor 1099 to take, not spend all of it. Because they're owe taxes on it, right? They're gonna pay their own taxes. And because no taxes withheld on it. But the company itself doesn't have to then engage in all the workman's comp insurance on employee, all that stuff, that overhead that comes with having an actual W2 employee. The reason that I like that model. Is. And it's something I saw y combinator a while ago is, you know, because some. Some people are like, do I bootstrap my own company and not raise capital and just try to pay for everything myself and get it up and running? Or do I go raise money? And yes, it dilutes me out some, but some of that money I can use to pay myself a salary. Because, you know what happens is it allows you to get off the ground faster. So that person who's getting compensated for working for the company. Is able to focus more on getting the company off the ground, which benefits all the owners, all the equity holders. Faster than everyone just trying to do it on the side as a side hustle. And. Well, I had a meeting where I got a work commitment for the side job that I got to do, and it just puts everyone, you know, in a slower. So there is value. And it, in my opinion, it shouldn't. It should. Be something that everyone agrees to. It's not like, hey, I'm going to be the CEO of this startup, and so my salary is going to be $300,000 a year. No, it's going to be like, okay, we'll pay you compensation of, you know, 50,000 a year or something. It's going to be low. And it's going to, because it's just enough to let that person focus on working for the company. And then everyone else is going to benefit from, you know, when the company becomes profitable, their, their equity stake now has money. So there are, there are funds later on to take owner Drawstrom, and then when there are owner draws. If that person who's also getting conversation is, you know, they get their owner draw the same as anyone else. They're not a lesser owner because they're also working for the company. They're actually, you know, allowing some of the other owners to focus on their other jobs. And so there's value in that, and that is what their being compensated for. That's. Actually, I thought about that last night. Paying a founder as a contractor, and I was. I wasn't sure if that was even legal. But it sounds like it is. Which certainly I'm not here to get legal advice, so I would. I would. That was just an idea to do, but I don't think it's illegal. But, you know, do your own research before. Hey. Sherwin told me we could do this, and then. I don't want a legal malpractice. I'll ask my attorney about that as well. He specializes in this kind of thing. But that. That actually did occur to me last night. Cause I was thinking about it, the best way to go about that, and then I totally forgot it. So that would certainly be the easiest, and I think if it's doable, most effective. Sherburn, how do you in my role of. I'm an ESA trustee. So when companies sell their when business owners sell their companies to their employees. Then I come in and negotiate the deal on behalf of the employees and stay on and oversee the trust that holds all their assets. And most of them are 100%. But there are partial sales. There are partial ESOPs where an owner will say, I'm gonna sell 45% or 49 or 30% to the employees. But they are still an owner, they're still an equity holder of the company, and they're still president. Well, after the sale. Of those companies, those owners now become, okay, your president and here's your salary. Like, that's it. Like, they become a W2 employee of the company, of which they still may own 70% of. But they are a W2 employee now of the company. Because they can't just dip in now and take money out as draws, because every. All the money that they take out, 30% of that has to go to the ESOP trust, like, so they. They don't have full control of the profits anymore. So it is allowed to be an owner, even a majority owner of a company, and still be an employee of that company as well. Yeah, I own 80% of my company. But I. When we restructured into a joint venture with a 20% partner, I started to take a payroll because for exactly that reason, I can't just distribute money to myself anymore. Exactly. Yeah. Okay? So can we touch? And now we're talking about the legal for the best process way to handle this. But just while we're on this, can we just talk about because we are running into this problem, which is for some of us that maybe have other jobs or their role is just not as active at this point. Right. And like, they're not like, Howard has spent 40 hours plus plus plus plus on this for almost a year for free. And Drew spent a lot of time on it for free as well. He's balancing two jobs. I've been working on this for five years, and I've spent a lot of time on it. Vinod has spent a lot of time on it, but not nearly as much as Howard, because right now he has another job. And that is a critical thing for us because we are stalling. And if we had Vinod full time, we would be able to advance the MVP faster than we are. But he's burning out and it's just, it's not possible for him to manage a software engineering team in India when he's working a full time job and then contribute himself. And then the last member is the person that is the person that has the most connections in the hotel industry and will make a lot of introductions and things like that. He also has his own company and works pretty much full time on that. And has probably spent the least amount of time and honestly contributed the least amount when it all comes down to it. But his connections are incredibly important for us growing this company. And we're all clashing because we're clashing. The gentleman that I just mentioned. Is very adamant that investors will view us taking an owner draw or salary very negatively, and they won't want to invest in us. I've done research that says that investors will understand that people have financial responsibilities, and they would prefer that the team be focused on the business if they're investing in it. So they will allow salaries or draws. Sherben, as you mentioned, in the lower range. Albeit the 50k range is probably more for a slower growth SaaS startup being a niche and very difficult asset class, we probably would slate in on a slightly higher range. On well, when we get to the point when we're really finalizing our precede and getting ready to raise our Series A that we would start to get to a more not a market because we'll still always be working below market. And so we've been in fighting about if the people that need to take draws or salaries should get help me here because I'm not sure I totally understand it. I'll just jump in. I think there have been again, it's like there have been a couple of points on which we have discussed. One of them. Which is why the one I brought up first is the mechanism for compensation early on. Which is it an owner draw? Is it a loan? Is it a salary? Being paid as a contractor. That one, I think, seems to be like the easiest because, Diane, I share Mark's concern that an owner draw is going to be looked at unfavorably by investors when the time comes, because it just looks like you're drawing. You're just taking investor money and then pulling it back out. Not that you're not doing something, but that owner draw is meant to say, right? Good job. This is the profit we're taking out, which so, like, it just doesn't. It's just not the right way to do it. That was the big concern. The second. I agree. And that's why view owner draws several compensation like it's got to be viewed as compensation. Not all the owners are pulling out an equal draw because I agree the investors would look at that. Just like that. I invested X amount. And immediately, you guys, I'll pull out, you know, 50 grand. And it's like, well, what did I get for that? I just paid you guys 50 grand. But that doesn't advance the the business. You know any farther? So. And then. So that's. I think the. I'll ask my attorney about the contractor pay. Cause I think could be. Could be the silver bullet to solve this. That, that piece of it. The second piece then is of course, the, you know, should founders get paid, or I think is more philosophical. Of, you know, should founders get paid for their work in addition to the equity that they already have? Cause, Diane, I would agree, I would disagree that none of us are working for free. We're all working for the equity that we have in the company. However, we also need. Everybody needs money to pay their bills. And that, that is the point, you know, kind of the challenge that again, like Mark and I have a full time job, the Node has a job, but we want Beno to leave so that he can spend more time on the company. And then you and Bernard, you. And excuse me, Howard are working full time on the company. But don't have secondary job. So I think. But actually, Mike, the way you phrase it, I think. Should be how we have this conversation internally. Is that compensation is in return for work being done today to grow the company. And as you pointed out, I mean, like, I don't know how many hours I'm spending on this. Maybe like 10ish a week. 1015 a week more than I anticipated, but certainly not full time. Mark is probably similar in that range. And then, you know, you and Howard are spending a lot more. I don't know how much he's spending. But he should be spending a lot more, right? So I think to the point about compensation is in exchange for work being done, I think maybe we need to restructure this part of the LLC agreement. To be very intentional that each, regardless of whether you're a founder or not, you know, people get paid, get compensated for their work. That is being done to grow the company. Cause I. Yeah, I think, Mike, again, you laid it out very, very clearly that the owner draw is, you know, it's very different than compensation. So. And if we have that conversation like that with Mark, I think that will be. Right, Because I'm very sensitive to the point of dilution of shares. I just have to tell you that because I've put my whole soul into this for so long. Right. And the lone piece of it. I worked at CBRE where all the employees were on a draw, and that was not a fun experience. It was very stressful thinking you had to owe back that money. And I don't want to go back into a situation like that. And then the third point is, how are we actually gonna decide? You and Mark draw a salary? Is it for 10 to 15 hours a week? Equivalent of 10. 15 hours a week. Because we have fundraising needs. Right. And you've mentioned before, only raise the funds that we need. Because of the dilution. This goes back to the business plan. If Mark and I personally at this point confident I will not need a salary. Mark, I think, is the same. That's what goes into the business plan. I mean, the less money we can raise, the more equity we will retain. However, if we need to spend money on something in order to grow the company, then we should do that. So it's like when we reviewed the budget yesterday. As I said, I am in no way trying to say that what I put on that page yesterday. Was the right answer. I was simply trying to put together a framework for the conversation. I think again Mark and I don't. We're not. I'm not gonna work full time on this company because I can't. Mark's probably not gonna same is cause he can't either. He's working another full time job as am I. You3 know Howard write different story. You want to can and will work full time on this. And therefore it should be part of your competition as part of the business plan. So the way that I would, it sort of ties back almost earlier to something way earlier discussed about do we need a schedule with the roles. Right. You could accomplish all this. Sort of. Let's. Let's say this one schedule, and you lay out all your roles. Maybe Vinog's chief technology officer, and I'm just making stuff up. So let's say chief technology officer. And his role. You all, all the founders have agreed or after discussion, you agree his role is going to be X. S is compensation. And if you can simplify it, and I don't know if you can, I hope you can, by this contractor model that just simplifies. You don't have to worry about withholding taxes and any of that. You can just pay them a gross, you know, x every month, you know, and, and that you've agreed to. And then, you know, Diane's got a role, Howard got a role, Drew's got a role. And I don't know the other gentleman's name. I apologize, but. So you can lay out all your rules for each of the five of you and some, like you say, Drew, you may say, I don't need a salary. I can do these 10 hours a week and that's it. And I don't. Need a salary. I'm just doing it for to, you know, do the company. And Vinod may need a salary. And it's this and Howard and Diane and the other gentlemen, you know, you all, you all agree as to what your compensation is going to be for those roles. And not affect anything with your ownership equity interest like this is just compensation for those roles. You're all still going to be equal owners. You're also no one's taken a loan against their ownership or their equity to pay back, or now someone else has the option to buy them because that's just going to really cause trouble and stress on folks. And then that. And then you take that budget that you agree to for comp. And then you obviously have other costs. You have those other developers, maybe you have server time or you're running space on the cloud or whatever, and then you can come up with, this is our burn rate, right? This is how much we need a month. To function this company with compensation, with maybe any capex or software licensing or server time or whatever. This is our burn rate. How long do we now go from here to generating revenue? Like how? Like what is that time? Not just we have an MVP that's going to beta test, but when we can start generating revenue. And now you can see, okay, we need that much money to get from zero revenue to revenue. That's when the decisions are. How much do we need to raise in capital? And then that's where that dilution is going to come in. Because then it's what's the valuation for each round? And then, because, as you know, each round is just going to lead to more dilution. But even, let's say I, my angel. Invest prior to any series. I get deluded too, as soon as you go, and I have no say in it because I'm not a voting member. So I just get deluded along with you guys as you go and keep raising more and more capital. And that's just. That's how I would approach it. Yeah. Okay?

### You (2025-09-17T19:58:10.374Z)

Makes sense. Thanks.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:58:10.834Z)

But you got to have those hard conversations. But to the folks that are getting compensation also, It's. You have to understand, you're a startup with no revenue, so you can't be like, hey, I want $100,000 a year. I don't. That's probably not going to happen because the investors aren't going to be like, we're paying you $100,000. A year for what? There's no revenue. You can, you know, And I would. I would go as low as you can go to be able to work on this. And then knowing as soon as you start getting revenue in the door, Then you can start giving. Then you can start having raises with, with the revenue that's coming in the door. Then as you grow, you guys can vote as a, as a voting class. Okay, we know you've been taking a very baseline pay, but now we're starting to be successful. Now we'll all agree to raise the, you know, start raising the compensation. But that vote would be require four of the five of us, not five of the five of us. Yes. I wouldn't have any votes. Really? Be five of the five of you.

### You (2025-09-17T19:59:18.054Z)

Yeah, yeah.

### Guest (2025-09-17T19:59:18.514Z)

Okay? Or it would be, you know, whether we, I think we said earlier we would change all decisions like that from action by members. We could say unanimous consent amendment certificates down or. We could include in here. This is a supermajority majority. It was probably a super majority, but, you know, changing of roles and compensation. I mean, this is this. Yes. And this is also another topic that I don't know if it has to go in here. It may or some future. It'll probably go definitely. When you were raising capital with Series A and now you have other equity owners. There'll be something called drag along rights that are going to be in there, like when, let's say, this thing goes public. And or not public. That's a veteran. Because everyone would get shares in public. Let's say CBRE comes in and wants to buy you guys out. Wants to buy the product. And so many of you agree to it, but you have some minority shareholders that are holding out. They're like, no, I'm not selling my shares. That could hold up the deal. Unless you have drag along rights where so many members are, so much percent of the equity owner agrees to sell. Those minorities are drug alone. They're forced to sell at that price. I mean they can't hold up that deal. So that's another, that's another reason why you don't want unanimous stuff. Interesting. That doesn't have to go in right now because. No, no, no. In the formal round of the Series A, where they're getting significant equity in the company. Their lawyers may have some in the, in those agreements that will go along with it. There may be something called drag along rights in there. Okay? I think so. Okay. This is all fair. Humbled, I think. Diane, to your. Or I guess, to this part of the conversation. Right. If we put in here that actions by members at a supermajority can include changes to roles and compensation. And in the founder. I guess we'll call it founder roles and maybe founder roles in compensation and exhibit, you know, of its own that will go at the bottom. Is where we'll lay this out. I mean, subject to the. I mean, that's the. Again, it'll come from the business plan that we reviewed. Which I think I have. Well, actually, I think I already sent it to you guys, but it's great. We stretch it out six months. We should stretch it out another six. And another six, just as best we can. And that'll help us understand, you know, again, like, where's the revenue generating mark? That I'm really not sure, but, you know, and then how much money do we need to raise? And then about the raising of capital because, I mean, go fast forward 18 months for doing well, this should be much easier. We can, you know, run a process and all the things that Mark has been talking about. But as we're in this very serious cash crunch situation, how are we deciding if we're taking an investment or not, it requires supermajority as well. Because there may be. There may be some unique clauses, right? Like, I'm gonna work a bit for Carlos junior, right? And I'm doing this. Even though it's gonna stretch me probably to my absolute limit, because I really believe he's a leader in technology in the hotel industry. He has a product internally that could help if we understand it. Could help us accelerate gotomer market strategies on the investment management module and some other things. So that's a little bit of a different thing. Right. And there's. And then we're debating about valuation caps. We're trying to understand that right now. I was researching this morning the idea of a special thank you friends and family pool that, I don't know, call it 2 to 3% that they are invested. They're subject to the valuation cap on the valuation of their shares. But on exit, they're awarded 2% that gets split peripasue according to their original investment. And I mean, I'm dreaming right here now, but that could be like $20 million for the group of five to seven people that come in and invest early. So how do we find a way to work? Through that. When there could be. Drew, you went through it, right? And I know you don't want us to go through what you went through with actable. But we're probably going to have some things we have to work out with the first handful of investors. Yeah. Talk about the Safe note now. I mean, maybe. Right? Because the safe note, I think. And thank both Sherben Andrew for all the information that you've shared with me on Safe Notes. I went through it all this morning. Right. Just because I believe that we have the ability to scale some of the other companies that I showed you. I think the bottom line 5 million valuation cap is a little too low for the first round of investors. It should be closer to seven. But we could have disagreement on this, right? We get a disagreement with the investor. Let me just throw this out. I don't like coming up with I don't know what the methodology is on the valuation. But I always like to go back to Apple. Everyone knows that Apple is. Fastest company you get to Fortune 100. All this so I don't think you'll grow faster than Apple went from zero to growth. Their initial angel round Investor valuation was $750,000. That was their opening valuation. Before Series A. The first Mike Markula. If you look them up, you know, famous investor. Paid $250,000 for 1/3 of Apple. And that was their initial valuation was 750. I don't think you'd get even at a Series A with no revenue. Multi million dollar valuation. Like when you were like saying 5 or 7 million. I'm not personally, Diane, I'm not going to invest at that valuation. That's way too high. So if you won the you can look this up on their site. If you win the Y Combinator competition, of all the great ideas that go through there. They work out of valuation? I think it's at one and a half million dollars. And they structure multiple rounds of investment. So a five million dollar initial valuation. I don't see any investor giving you guys that valuation. Go ahead. Drew. This is a, like, common. Yeah. Like I said, I went through the same thing with multiple potential investors with my own company, where it's, you know, they're like. We like the idea you have revenue, but the company is not worth the amount of money that you know. It's like you have this bid ask spread basically this gap between what the investor values and the founder values, and it's somewhat irreconcilable. Which is why we did what we were going to do. A safe note. Right. Which is for my. From my existing company, I did a convert a couple of convertible notes. But in this case, I mean, which were fine, but in this case, we were into a safe note, which is an investment for like a, you know, wait and see. Like, basically, like invest now and then you'll get shares of like, equity when the valuation occurs. Right? Because simple, simple agreement for future equity. That's where yeah, exactly. So we were, you know, for this first round, we were going to do a series of safe notes. Without any attached valuation, but with the valuation cap. Of $5 million because we feel that when we do get evaluation, right. So we'll pro I don't know how many rounds of seed or precede valuation we will do, but when we, you know, we'll do a couple rounds of those, it's increasingly, you know, higher valuation caps. But when we get to the. Valuation round. We should, you know, we will, we should be able to get 5 million or something like that. I mean, that's, and this is again, I hear you about Apple, but I think that was, I mean, nobody knew what technology and computer and Apple was in those days, so I would argue that the comparison is a little bit. Not quite apples to apples. Although I would love to have been back in the eighth. No. Yeah. On a safe note, right, you. You agree on what the valuation is on a post money basis? Well, yeah. There's like pre money and post money. So we the post run the post money is the, the market now, like, because it's a simpler one to understand. I mean everyone is so at, let's say in the, in the valuation that's agreed to, or the cap, if you will. Is if you guys. Yeah, if you guys, let's say. And I'll just throw a simple. Smaller numbers. $500,000 valuation in the safe round as and you raise $50,000 through that. Then that's easy to understand, right? A 10% dilution. So 2% out of all five of you. So you guys are all 18%, and then there's 10%. But that dilution does not happen now. It does. It may net. You know, it doesn't happen. It's just, you get. The money. And then you go to a seed round. And the value is, you know, 5 million. Let's say. Let's say it goes all the way to 5 million. And that's what's agreed in that round, the Series A, that's when all the safe notes convert, like right before, like right before the round. And then. So now that 10%. Dilution happens. And then you raise, you know, your, your Series A money at that valuation. Then even the safe investors are all diluted out like they contribute all their, you know, the share. So everyone gets deluded to the Series A round. The reason for that agreed to valuation in those safe agreements. So say you say you put a $5 million valuation in the SAFE agreement and 50 and you raised 50,000. Dollars. So. So now you're at, like, 1% dilution, right, for what you raised. But then you go and you Series A it, and they're all like, nope. And the best you can get at a Series a is a $1 million valuation, not a 5. Well, then instead of 1%, all those safe investors are going to convert to a 5%. Like they get the great. The. The sort of. They're capping their dilution at whatever the safe note says. But if, when the trigger happens to convert them to equity, if that valuation is lower than what the safe node said. Then those investors get the safe, investors get the lower valuation and their investment converts to whatever percent that lower, they get more, more equity. Yeah. And I think that the reason for, I mean, Having just gone through this over the last couple of years, like, no, no investors going to invest. Anything less than a million bucks. Like institutional investors, even. I shouldn't even say institutional investors. These are hospitality technology specific investors that are more strategic, you know? Strategic investors. Right. They're very familiar with the product. The platform, the niche, the market. All of that. I mean, very clearly not going to invest less than a million dollars. They're just not going to write a check for less than that. It's not worth it to them. So you know the value weight from a million dollar investment to our. From our perspective at the point at which we need a million dollar investment will have ARR. Like you know, like there's gonna the precede rounds up to that. Are going to be not valued. Rounds. So investing now at a $5 million cap. Means that when we do come to a valued round like a Series A, we expect to be at a five million dollar valuation with, say, a million dollar investment in exchange for 20%. It could be more, but. And I'm not doubting that, but I'm just saying as a potential safe round investor, I expect, since I'm investing earlier, to get a lower valuation than what you're going to present to the public. Otherwise, why would I just wait to the you guys raise the 5 million and then I'll, you know, when you go series A, then I'll say, give me a call at series A and I'll decide to invest then. Like to raise pre Series A. It's like getting in pre ipo. You get a better term than the public gets at the IPO because you're in first. There's no. I agree. I get that. If they're going to get the same valuation that you're going to give later. You're not going to raise anything early on because there's no incentive to that. I agree. I see. You're saying. All right, well, the five of us can go back. Do we need to talk about that? And just to put that out there, that actually might end the discussions, right? Because Sherbet and I totally hear what you're saying. But I have done. I feel like I've done so much research on this over the last couple of days. And I went to all the resources that you both told me. And the general advice is do pre money valuation caps. That 5 million is for a low growth company. A higher growth company. I can literally just take one that's in our space. It's called Paraview, and they are an investment management company. Institutional, like digitizing that space for office, retail, multifamily and industrial. Their pre money valuation was like 30, 30 to 50 million when they converted or when they did their Series A. So I just like look at this from our perspective. If you're 50K and then you become 10%, if we raise another 1, 2, 3, 4 investors at 50K, we've just diluted 50. Percent of our business, and we've only raised $250,000. And we're debating this internally about how much capital we're going to need. I mean, maybe Drew is right. It's only a million dollars. But if it takes us three years to get to Series A and to get. Or maybe it takes us two years to get to Series A, but we have 3 million in ARR. With a clear trajectory to get to 30 to 50 million, which is achievable. In our space because the company that Drew is working with right now. Where he is in the process of negotiating a partnership and an API integration. They are at 82 million in ARR. In this space. And so we just. I mean, we're coming. Somehow the two of us are just coming up with very different set of numbers. And if we can figure it out, that's great. But if we can't figure it out, I mean, well, we may. I mean, we may end up parting ways on a really nice, you know, like, come back to a sit Series A. And we'd love to talk to you, but we're learning this all ourselves. This is the first time, other than Drew, than. Any one of us has done this, so bear with us on that. Yeah. And you don't have to give the same valuation to every safe note is like you can. You can vary the valuations from. From person to person. Yeah, well, I think. And I think we absolutely will vary them. I think we for this first. Six month timeframe. We're close to figuring out exactly how much money we will need.

### You (2025-09-17T20:16:27.894Z)

They're all negotiable.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:16:40.834Z)

The valuation cap will be the lowest it's ever going to be. Once we raise that amount of money, whatever it is, we will stop and we will probably immediately start going to raise more money, but at a higher valuation cap. And I don't know how many times that will happen, but it'll happen a couple of times. In conjunction. My advice is don't. Don't. Why go through so many rounds evaluation like don't? I wouldn't have the goal of. What's the next round evaluation? You have a solver problem. It's to scale a software product. You're not building the factory. You're not. I mean, every. The infrastructure is there. Like if the cloud is there, aws, Azure, it's all there, built, pre built for you. It's just renting, leasing space on servers. You're not, it's not like you're starting Tesla or something and you have to scale a factory and you need, you have very low capex as a software company. Very high margin, very low Capex. Yeah, I would. I would get to a revenue producing product as fast as possible and then just stop raising capital. Just use your revenue to grow it and quit diluting yourselves out. Like that's. That would be. My goal is Series A maybe and then stop. Maybe you can raise enough in pre Series A to get you to revenue where you guys can just support yourself. If you think you're gonna be in one to two years in the tens of forget 50. But even like the millions of dollars that you should never have to raise capital again. Yeah, I agree. If we, if we are successful and start to get enough revenue within the first couple of years, then we wouldn't need to continue to raise money. And I know, and I probably I don't think I've ever said that, Diane, but that, you know, when we've been having this conversations is that if we could get enough, like, I don't I never did any more investing. Like, I never did any more fun raising. Cause I didn't. Well, Ape, because I nobody would invest. But also, you know, I got it. I could do everything I needed to with cash flow from operations. So if we can get enough money. Looking at a company like a lease, AI that just raised their Series E funding and has 250 million. And there are now segueing into health care. And there's another sector, but it took them eight years and they have a really good business plan. It was AI first. When AI wasn't even there. But I look at a model like that, I look at actable, and I say, okay, they can do this. This is a niche market, but it's very, very deep. And so we should aim for 100 million in ARR over 5 years. But every company that I've looked at that has that kind of revenue has associated Series A, B and Cs, at least to get. There? Yes, to get to that. To do that. I would agree. You would? Almost certainly. Even for a technology company, you would certainly need a massive amount of money. Right. I believe that we could truly, if you go into that many rounds at those valuations, Honestly, you all would be deluded, down to less than 5%. And those investors would very easily just kick you out of the company. Yeah. Five percent would be a lot of money. But it would be. You would no longer like actables found. You don't work there anymore. None of the profits. Poor people work there anymore.

### You (2025-09-17T20:20:03.014Z)

No.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:20:10.434Z)

Which was by design. I think they grew that company over 10 to 15 years from the, I don't know, whatever mid to late 90s to whenever it was acquired by Alpine investors. But they don't work there anymore. They did that awareness mean a song. I'm just gonna put an example out there. She's been with Elise AI for eight years and she's still running it. She started it just like we are, and they got it too. This crazy, you know, 100 million multiple. Range. And why I think we can do this is we go back to that network effect, right? There are Berends and there are so many disconnected processes that if we just start to solve them, Every piece of the puzzle that we put together has this network effect. And so we should be aiming high on this, and we should be looking at competitors more like Procore and BTS and Paraview, which, again, I understand they're. They're bigger property types, but they're taking a smaller piece of the operating landscape. Right. And my idea on this is we're a smaller property type, but no one really wants to deal with hotels. And so we go very, very deep into our property type and accomplish something similar.

### You (2025-09-17T20:21:27.894Z)

So, Diane, you and I had a conversation way back, like at the very beginning, probably even before I could committed to going full time, where I expressed a strong belief in bootstrapping and not getting funding. And we're not gonna make a decision today. But one thing I think we have a little bit of a different paradigm. I view fundraising as getting alone. They're giving us money because we need the money to do something more, Elise. They started off as a chat bot for leasing agents in apartment communities. Now they're looking at health care. They need that money in order to expand out and grow. And what Mike said is absolutely true. Every penny that we bring in from an investor. Means our share goes down. And like you said, we could get 95%. In fact, you and I talked about this a couple months ago. Where we could get fired, right? If somebody comes in here and all of a board. It happens all the time. They replace the C suite, they do whatever they want because they no longer own the company. I view fundraising as a bad thing. You, I think, are looking at it as a means of growth. And I kind of go back to what Mike said as well. Is that you don't have to continue to fundraise. If you are profitable and you can grow through your own cash flow, you have no reason at all to go out and get more funding.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:23:14.594Z)

Except for could limit your. Except what? Except that it could limit your growth.

### You (2025-09-17T20:23:15.574Z)

Right. Well, that's it.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:23:24.914Z)

We have X amount of profits, you'll only be able to reinvest that into your company versus the infusion of capital that would help you accelerate modules, accelerate things that get you to the higher revenue.

### You (2025-09-17T20:23:38.534Z)

That's what I meant. Where the only people that get funding is if they need that funding to accomplish something, whether it expand or Zion or vertically.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:23:45.074Z)

That's what I'm saying, too, right? Right.

### You (2025-09-17T20:23:50.534Z)

Let's look at this step by step. Right. What I always say. We're eating an elephant. Let's take it one bite at a time. Let's not worry about series b, c, d and e today. I don't want to sound like I'm being flippant about it, but let's cross that bear joint and get to it.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:24:12.194Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-09-17T20:24:12.694Z)

Let's get what we need to get started. Sure. Let's go for a Series A. But if we have enough cash flow. And I get Mike's point, too. We're not a test. We don't have a physical building. We are not investing in machinery. We don't have all this overhead. We're dealing in code, so if we need to expand, we're talking about. Okay, we hire one more developer for X amount of dollars a year.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:24:42.834Z)

So what it sounds like is I need to prove to you guys that the opportunity is there, right? Because I just don't, okay?

### You (2025-09-17T20:24:47.894Z)

Now we know the opportunity, sir. We know it's there. That's why we're here. I wouldn't be sitting in this chair if it wasn't there.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:24:53.314Z)

Firstly, as an outsider looking in. Well, first I'm sort of. I'm always. I'm in Howard sort of frame of thought and. Diane, you and I have had this conversation before. I'm a bootstrapper, right? Everything that I do is bouche. I don't have a ten million dollar company. But I'm happy. I don't need a ten million dollars company. I like working for myself and being so control of my domain, but be as an outside person or even outside say. I didn't even know you guys and I was an outside investor. The thing that would give me pause. I'm hearing you talk about $50 million. This, this, this. And look at this great opportunity. You have no product right now. Like we do, we haven't talked about. But we do have a product, yes? We are. We need a little bit more time to finish the mvp, but we have a solid base poc, and we'll have an MVP in the next few months. So we do have a product. And we do have a plan of going out and getting beta clients for each person a and starting in debt and structured finance, which could have a very quick multiplier effect. And look, I'm not, I'm not saying if we don't, if we have the profit and reinvested back in our company for growth, and we don't have to take money. Hallelujah. That's wonderful. But of the companies I'm talking about that, I'm saying the hospitality industry is big enough to support a strategy like an Elise AI because I just worked here 25 years, and I understand that nobody cares about hospitality and real estate, Right? So we're gonna go solve this problem. And we can make a lot of money. And not even the money. I mean, we can change the industry for the better. But I just. If we, if, and if you guys, if we get to the point where we can just reinvest our profits and get there, great. I'm happy with that. I've just never seen an example of a sizable company that's been able to. The other, the other question that you guys probably need to ask yourselves as a group because you have different personalities. The five of you in different places where you are in life. What is the exit strategy? Is everyone even agree I have that? Can I take that one, please? Because I haven't really thought through that in my mind. I'll just throw this out at you. If someone. If someone in a year from now came and offered you guys $20 million for your company. How many of you would take it? And say this was successful and how many are you are going to be like what I think were Diana is no pe. I'm gonna turn it down. Cause I think I can turn this into a hundred million dollar company. So Diana for them. Want to take the 20? You're out of the. Out of the hundred million dollar world, right? So that's all of you need to decide. Because that goes into Howard saying, do we need to raise money or. Enough of you satisfied with. I'm pro. I'm happy with the $20 million profitable company. I don't I have no illusions of running $100 million company or some of you all like no, I want to be the next unicorn and try to make and if that is where disconnects are, that will be disagreements down the road. You guys also need to get on, because that's gonna dictate. Because. And I'll just play devil's advocate, Diane, you may say we need to raise more money because we need to go vertical quick. And I want to get. And Howard like, are you kidding me? We got this great, profitable. Thing going slow and steady. I'm happy we're making money. And then you guys are doing this, and then that's when the whole. That's when some predator comes in and sees you guys are on different pages and then just buys you out for the 20 million. And then you made a lot of. Money. But I hope there's no hard feelings amongst you. I mean, that'd be great. Somebody can go buy my business they want tomorrow for 20 or 10 million, and I'll. And I'm out, and I'll just go sit on a beach somewhere. But those are also discussions you guys need to have. As, which is complicated. The more founders you have, the more what are your vision? Do you even have a shared vision for the same thing? And that's where you first got to start with, because I think investors are going to ask you guys that. And if you're getting different answers from different founders, what the vision of the property is or the company is, then you might scare some people off because they'll be like, you guys can't even agree amongst yourselves where you want it to go. How are we going to trust you to go row in the same direction? Okay? That's good advice. Thank you. Yeah. I need to go eat lunch. I haven't done that yet. I'm very hungry. Oh, you're on the West Coast. And Sherwin, thanks for staying on for an hour and a half. We really appreciate it. I got nothing going on the rest of the day since I got to get the fire, so I have a golf outing tomorrow. The law firm puts on. So I have nothing going on in the next 18 hours except play, so it's fine. That sounds nice. I'm jealous. But it's funny to hear. You're like, I eat lunch. And I'm like, wait, I forgot, you're in the West Coast. But this is very interesting. I think having Howard Fan and Mark and we should have a conversation because we didn't have that conversation. I did have that with Actus Data, my business partner. It was like one of the first things we talked about, so it would be good to talk about. And I think to. The safe note. Regardless of how we agree or how would that shakes out, we will need some money more than we, the five of us, I think, have. So the we will be using a safe note that will have some terms associated with it. So once we circle back and agree on that Mike, you'll be one of the person we come to and we hope that you will participate. I mentioned this to Diane as well. I may be willing to invest at a higher valuation if also, if we can work out something where there are options available. Because I know even in a Series A, they're going to force you to create an option pool which will also dilute you guys out too. Because the Series A folks are going to force you guys to dilute yourselves out first with an option pool and then to participate in some options, because I'll look at a total package. Diane did mention that goes back to what I asked. And you can all tell me to sound salt. I'm a big boy. Don't worry. No, but I think that goes back to my question at the beginning. Right. Which is like, what was your. Interest and level up design participation here. And this conversation has been extraordinarily helpful. So I think that's a good gauge for Howard, Diane and I to take back to Mark of Node and have a discussion about that. Amongst the other things that we've. Yeah, I just think that shared vision is probably the first place you guys need to start, is to where you see this going. And the various extra. And I'm not saying if Howard like, I'm just picking on two people that are here. If Howard like, 20 million is fine, and Diane's like, no, I need 100 million. All that means is in your operating agreement. Have the options built in that other founders can buy out other founders.

### You (2025-09-17T20:32:39.814Z)

Right.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:32:39.874Z)

Because when Howard is like, I'm done. This is big enough. I just want to go golf the rest of my life. But Diane's like, I want to keep taking the chance. Then Howard be like, there's a mechanism for Howard to sell his steak to you guys. And not sell it to some stranger that's going to come in and muck up the worst. So whether it's a writer, first refusal or something, if Howard looking to sell, then you guys had the first dibs on buying. And then it'll be like at the valuation, then you build something in there that will hire an independent valuation company that's going to come value the company so everyone's. Happy if you can't just agree amongst yourselves on what the value should be and then you can have it. You have all those mechanisms. In writing in place. So no one's hiring lawyers and suing. Because that's when I get involved, or used to get involved is are when people would start suing each other. And so I always see the fights. And if it was just straightforward at the beginning, that it saves you guys headaches later. Where would that go in the llc? Because that is a good point. Something like that. Like a buyout, right? Or first refusal. Yeah. You can just make up, put section 20 in there, write a first refusal or something, and you could probably chatgpt write something up for you if you wanted.

### You (2025-09-17T20:33:41.974Z)

Good point.

### Guest (2025-09-17T20:33:59.954Z)

But just something in there that if someone wants to exit. You guys have the right to buy them out because you have the stuff in there that I mentioned today. And God forbid any of you, something happens to you or you get divorced. None of you want to be in business with someone else's family member, so they get maybe economic benefit, but they don't get voting. Rights because that's the best thing. You want people coming in to do that. But then also put in there that you maybe have the right to buy those people out and so they don't get to just hang around too. You have the right to buy them out at a fair value as well. Yeah. I think we do have that in here already. Diane did with it. All right. This is all very helpful, surely helpful. Yeah. Thank you. We will circle up to discuss internally and no doubt be in touch. Very soon. Okay, Sooner than I appreciate.

### You (2025-09-17T20:34:58.454Z)

Yeah. Thank you very much.
