# Transcript for: InnVestAI All Team Meeting

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:30:19.806Z)

My notetaker's here too. Let me turn her off.

### You (2025-08-26T21:30:25.649Z)

Good afternoon.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:30:27.806Z)

Good afternoon. Drew, did you have your pitch yet? Or is it still later in the day, right after this? Because right after this, okay? If we go up to the end, I will probably drop off early. Mark isn't joining today. He has an event tonight. Drew, are you joining Thursday? Did I see a decline Thursday? Just so we know, because it's the holiday weekend and everything like that. No. I think I said yes to this Thursday. I sent it out. As a series this time, because this time seems to be working for us. This Tuesday, Thursday 5:30 slot. I think it was this one. I said maybe. Okay? Yeah, it was this one. I said maybe, but I'm here. Okay? All right, let's start with the LLC agreement. I finally got it out. I know. It's like it's an entire red line. And I'm very sorry about that. I just drew. As I started to go through and look at the OR provisions, I was using AI to say which one is better for us. And then it just kept recommending things that we should include. So I don't know if it's overkill or not. Do you have a chance? I've not looked yet. I should have a chance to do that. This weekend when I was done, probably tomorrow. Okay? And same Howard and Vinod. Did you guys have the chance to look at it or have thoughts? You shared it on the email then.

### You (2025-08-26T21:32:07.729Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:32:10.286Z)

Sunday. Okay. Sorry. I haven't even seen that email. But I'll go through that.

### You (2025-08-26T21:32:18.049Z)

I read through it. I also ran it through a little AI chatgpt. Claude, explain this to me like I'm a five year old thing.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:32:25.166Z)

Good. Yeah.

### You (2025-08-26T21:32:31.249Z)

It looks fine. Weather is overkill or not. I don't think so. But I've never set up an llc yet.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:32:41.566Z)

Done this. Right.

### You (2025-08-26T21:32:42.689Z)

So nothing to compare it to. But yeah, I think to be at least what was input makes sense.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:32:43.566Z)

Yeah. Okay. I appreciate that because, well, I want to say this. After doing this with AI, I could never go back. To doing this. And I think that's the way people are going to be with all things that they start to use AI for. Right. And then when companies put security provisions around it, employees are going to get mad like, well, wait a minute, I can get this done in like a fraction of the time if I have tools, and you're not giving me the tools. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens with security and company security and things like that going forward with AI. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing is this. The LLC that, as it was drafted, we could just. We can sign it. Obviously, we don't look at it unless something goes bad. But it's also, if we do raise Series A capital. This is fine for Series A capital. It's comprehensive enough that we wouldn't have to go in and redo the LLC agreement. So we just. If everyone's okay with it, or if we need to negotiate any provisions. Do. I put a provision in specifically about hotel biz and non competes, right? To make sure that got carved out. All good. We know you have this company and Vinod, I tried to put language in there about your wife signing and anything about a visa or check that language. Too. And, yeah, I think that's it pretty much.

### You (2025-08-26T21:34:22.129Z)

Actually, that brings up a good point. I mean, the way that I read and interpreted the spouse thing, it seemed like everybody had signed up. Was that the intent?

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:34:30.446Z)

I think that's true. I think that this is the first time I've done this, but it seems like spousal consent is like. Or spousal, I don't know. What would you call it? Is a pretty big thing. And I'll see. Everybody's spouses have to consent.

### You (2025-08-26T21:34:32.129Z)

Okay?

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:34:45.966Z)

Well, maybe. Howard, maybe if you have a minute, just research that and see if I'm overkill. But there was a so much about spousal consent.

### You (2025-08-26T21:34:56.289Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:34:56.366Z)

I've never heard of that. That's interesting, but you guys also need consent. From your spouse for llc. I don't. I thought. And I don't have any. I've never had my wife consent to any of them. She probably should.

### You (2025-08-26T21:35:13.649Z)

Yeah. I think in the nodes situation, if his wife is actually going to be the named the partner, that's a little bit different.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:35:19.406Z)

Yeah, I think that's more.

### You (2025-08-26T21:35:25.329Z)

My wife knows I'm doing this, so I'm not worried about it.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:35:27.326Z)

Yeah. I did put a provision in that said, because it didn't have it, that like successors, like, if our children or something like that were to take over this business for us,

### You (2025-08-26T21:35:39.249Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:35:39.966Z)

That they would. How did it go? They would have an economic right, but not like a voting right automatically. That would have to be a decision made by the majority or supermajority of the llc. Because there was a lot of talk about, all right, if second generation, like, we're not going into business with you're. Not going into business with Charlie Fox. Right? You're going into business with Diane Fox. So you might not want a Charlie Fox in the future. A 25 year old kid coming in and, you know, saying that this is my interest in the company.

### You (2025-08-26T21:35:53.249Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:36:16.606Z)

But I think we're close. And, Howard, you and I are talking to Mike Sherbin on Friday morning. He's an attorney as well, so we can run some of this by him. But that was a task. It really would have taken me weeks to do that without AI. So I'm really, really glad. And I reached out after I did that. I saw today. That or over the weekend. Watkins Latham, which is a law firm that Megan Kochi works for. Drew, they just did an enterprise agreement with Harvey. And so I reached out to her to try to talk about what that means for them and, like, what that could mean for us and the legal world. Right. As far as workflows. So I'm hoping at some point to have a conversation with her about it or another big law firm that might be looking to use an enterprise AI platform like Harvey. Interesting. Law firms using. I mean, I guess it's better that they use it than get replaced by it. Yeah. But the security is going to be. That's pretty. It is going to be really interesting to see how the security works. That's really all I have. This weekend. I might be talking to Carl Rodriguez Jr. But I was supposed to talk to him last Friday, but he tends to cancel a lot. So I'm hoping maybe this Friday I'll be able to connect with him about potential investment. And then after Labor Day, once we feel like the mvp, depending on where the MVP is, we'll just continue with fundraising efforts. It's the biggest thing right now. Labor Day. So I don't think we are going to have the product been very solid. State by Labor Day, and it's just probably less than one and a half month. Yeah. But yeah, as I said initially, it's going to take probably two to three months when it is much better state. It definitely getting in a demoable state, but not in a state where we can onboard a client and they can use it on day to day basis. Right. And there may be a few clients like, I guess, Drew. You and Mark and I will need to talk about Peachtree. Because my conversation with Brian, I told him we were at POC and we needed to get to mvp. And he asked me how much would it take for you guys to get to mvp? And, like, could we be a beta client with you? So you and Mark and I will just need to talk about that. Maybe after labor. Day. Like, is the MVP in enough of a position that we could go to Peachtree Group right after Labor Day and have that conversation with them. And there may be a few other. They wanted to be an investor or they wanted to, like, start using it. Start using it. But if Brian is right, their credit team, not the entire company. He thought it would best be used for their debt and structured finance team. And he was going to introduce us to his debt and structured finance team. But he was like, well, we spent 170k in a blink of a hat, right? And so that's not a lot for us to potentially work with you to get to your beta. And I know that Mark has Greg Friedman on his list as a potential friends and family investor, so it's all somewhat connected. My thought on that is one is I think we should have the expectations very clear right now. It's not very stable product, right? They come in a thought that they'll just start using it as a full fledged running application. And we are kind of is stabilizing lot of things. What if we brought on a beta client? Is it still way too early to bring on a beta client, or would a beta client help us? Still too early. Okay.

### You (2025-08-26T21:40:16.769Z)

Yeah. Yeah. It is too early. So kind of to tag on to what Vinod is mentioning. Over the weekend logged into the dev environment and started to take a look at it. I think we're at least three weeks from today before we could have anybody logging in. Maybe even more to know. Jump in if I'm making it. But from what I saw already, there was a lot of things that need to go back and change that. I'm not pointing fingers at the developers. They did a great job. It was like one of the very first things that they built just kind of to see if it works right. So like the property details modal was not at all like what was in the POC and scoped out. But they did it before that POC was or the PRD created anyway. So that's pretty minor. The other things that I found, like, on the pipeline were things that were added later, I think. Drew, you mentioned we would want to have the closing date on there, because that then goes into some of the other calculations that we added there. Super simple fix just to add another column for that right there. But they still have all. That's a small portion of the whole product, right?

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:41:53.246Z)

A few things to add there. Right. One is timeline. Yeah, I would say probably will be in much better shape after probably three, four weeks. A month. The other thing is, whatever feedback you guys sent me afterwards, we have not started working on those at all. But are we had initially we have that in progress. We kind of trying to. Go from there. But whatever feedback user I know, they are very quick fix. We can do that quickly. The other thing I want to discuss is whether we have any clarity. Like, when can I come full time? Because right now, I'm like, working. Yes, I know. We don't know how, Faith. Then work it till 4 o'clock in the morning. I'm messing up a lot of things. And then, of course, these guys have a lot of dependency on me, too. So even I'm in office, I'm kind of continuously in touch with you on this lot of many million office hours. So I would really like to see that happening. We don't need immigration. I don't need immigration right now. The company in the other company, the way I'm working with Morgan, we can do the same thing. So some company holds the Visa. We can just make contract through them. Are even simpler. Like my wife has S 480. If we can just pay her directly rather than coming payment to my account, that would work out too. But I really need to sit dedicatedly on this. There's a lot of work to be done. Team has dependency on me. These are all technical things, right? Pipelines are not doing. This is not happening. That is not happening. I'm in touch with them throughout the day, but I think I really need to be more focused. Right. I mean, Drew, I wasn't my intention in the beginning to go out and fundraise with a full mvp. Just for what it's worth, I'm going to just tell you guys, you probably saw it all over the LinkedIn. Elise AI secured their series E funding. Last week, and they're valued at $2 billion. And I'm going to forget Mina's last name. She's one of the founders, but Mina Song. And I was reading an interview. They started back in 2017, 2018, while they were working on their MVP and they went to a handful of user clients in the multifamily space, I think, like Avalon Bay. And a couple others that signed on and helped them finish the mvp. But they had either it was either income or investors through that stage. And so we have to figure something like that out in OR Q. Because, yeah, I think.

### You (2025-08-26T21:44:51.089Z)

I've been saying all along that we can use the POC for something like that. They don't need to actually get in there and start inputting values and clicking buttons. They just need to see that we have something that works. And then they can build on from there.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:45:08.046Z)

Well, I think that's the difference.

### You (2025-08-26T21:45:08.769Z)

It's not going to bring in the big money, but it can bring in some of the other ones.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:45:13.406Z)

I guess it would mean the difference between are we asking somebody or a company to. Pay money. And get nothing in return for 2, 3, 4, 5 months. And I guess, what are they getting in return, right? It could be use of the product or it could be a stake in the company. Those are all very different things. And companies are going to have very different perspectives. On what they're willing to do. I think the easiest or the easiest thing to accomplish would be to get a couple of companies like a peach tree and maybe an access point financial to, if the product were to a point where they could start to use it, Then we'd say, like, look, pay something for. Very basic functionality as we continue to ramp it if they really obviously didn't have to believe. And that's a very different ask than saying, like, we have a POC and we're going to build it, but we are building it. And it'll be ready in three months. Start paying us money now. In exchange for. I mean, if we got equity, then that's a different story, which maybe we want to go down that road. It's just hard to. I think on Peachtree that would. I mean, if Mark knows Greg as well as he does, because this is going to go to Greg, I'm sure, right? So why wouldn't they? Why wouldn't it? Well, if it were me, I would put 50k in and just try to have a say in how the product looks and feels so it fits my function. To the best of its ability. But you're right. You're every. Every investor will view this a different way. I just. I feel like we just can't hang on for, like, we have to figure something out in 4Q because going another six months without any investors. Is very, very hard for us. And so we need to. Know, Howard. How long do you think? Roughly. Until we have something that a customer could use. Probably three to four weeks. Oh, so they could probably upload their document, see the data in pro forma, see the deal pipeline, deal details, all those things.

### You (2025-08-26T21:47:50.049Z)

Yeah. And when we say a product that they can use, it will not be a product that's going to replace their Excel spreadsheet.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:47:57.086Z)

Right.

### You (2025-08-26T21:47:57.649Z)

In four weeks, right? But for somebody to get in there and start critiquing. And just giving us some feedback.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:48:04.846Z)

Saying how they want it to look right and giving feedback on that Persona of what is a lender need in this tool.

### You (2025-08-26T21:48:06.609Z)

Yeah. Right? Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:48:14.046Z)

Yeah, I mean, Greg Freeman probably has a lot more say over how the money in Peachtree is invested, I get the sense, anyway, than, say, start with capital. Well, I'm sure Barry Stern has a lot. I'm sure. Actually, he has as much say as Greg Friedman. But even I. Have not probably for better. I have not gotten from a Barry Stern, like, nor do I have any desire to do so. Right. We need to go to people that are, have more that aren't. Well, I mean, eventually we'll go to the big like the big companies for their. I'm sorry, I'm tired tonight, so. But the incubator program s. But we need true friends and family in the hospitality industry. You're like, we need people that can write a 50k track, right? Like Dan Lesser. I mean, we need a few day unlessers. I'm talking to a woman on Thursday. Her name is Glenn Appeal. I don't know, Drew, if you've ever heard of her, but she's one of the only women that is senior. That is maybe like Mark's class, if you would call it like from a grouping perspective, and she is huge. Into supporting female led businesses. So I'm gonna see if I can ask her to help with some introductions. The people that might be willing to invest in us. I have another call after Labor Day with a woman is the founder of. I've told you guys, I mentioned this before, but the place where Andrea works and this is escaping my mind tonight. With the company's name is, but to see if maybe their founder would be interested in an investment in US. But I'll just. Drew, I'll kind of beg that you and Mark and I need to really start to figure this out in 4Q because it's been seven, eight months. And that's a long time for a team to go without any funding. If there's something that can. Yeah. I get reluctant to show the POC to additional groups because I don't want to repeat of what happened with Ellen. Right. She was less than enthusiastic about it. And if we are going to ask the company to start to actually pay something, then I think. It's overwhelming. Ly better to have something they can actually use. An IP or just something to show. Before Lisa would. If we onboard a client towardly they might lose interest in for long term involvement. Well, that's who. Yeah, I mean. There's not like a very. Thread the needle, I guess. But I totally hear what you guys are coming from. I have been there. Think about it. I mean, Mark is going to obviously have strong opinions on this as well. But if we're four weeks away from having something that. Is maybe. And actually, let me rephrase the question. I haven't looked at the dev site or the staging site, so maybe that's where I should go look next. But if we're close to having something that. Has most of the same functionality that the Presentation Perspective has most of the same functionality that the POC has, then perhaps that's closer to the point where we can take it to a Greg Friedman or to Access Point Financial. I think true. Part of the thing is I understand the idea of pitching in a half hour and being succinct. But where we made the mistake is we didn't take in the pitch deck. Talon. Maybe more than the poc. Talked about the poc a little bit. But she needs to be able to understand what the vision is and that it's realistic. If you look at companies like Elise, AI and others, it's being done in other sectors. So we need to do this in hospitality. So we messed up a little bit in that we probably should have blocked an hour of Ellen's. Time and spent a good half hour talking about how we plan to. What does Mark say? It's not where the hockey puck is, it's where the hockey puck is going. Right. So that's what we should have explained to her is where the hockey puck is going. It was the first time the four of us had all been on a call together, so we were trying to, I think, mesh different styles. And it didn't quite fit right because Mark style is a half hour succinct, but we're not to the point yet where we have a demo product that's like that. And also we have to get people comfortable with what this idea is, even because the hospitality industry, probably as investors, have never really thought about a product like this. End to end if this is making sense. Product like this, right? Yeah. No, it's honestly hard to. Even for me, doing what I do for five years. I only recently, literally the last couple of months, really started to grasp what is a good dashboard and how does it work and how to build one for hospital. Ity. We built our first ones for this demo that I would actually say are good dashboards five years in, because I did. This is just not something I've ever seen before. So it's very hard to explain to people that are wholly unfamiliar with something. I guess Diane went. Maybe on our call with Mark. Whatever's tomorrow the next day? We can talk more about this. But three to four weeks from now. We should. Optimistically, that's when we should start to go at Phoenix October 6th. Right. I feel like that's almost like our soft launch. If he's going to mention it at a conference, then we're out there at this point. A lot. That Manager Association Conference in September that I got to book my flight for. That's a good one. I always get a bunch of there. That they would be. You know, they're your competition. That's where Michelle and Chad dominate that conference. Yeah, they do. Well, the single pain is for some reason, not present and nor is profit. It. At least I haven't seen them. But that's because you're not supposed to go there as a vendor. So technically, what I'm doing is against the rules. But they haven't really called me on it yet. Yeah. I think. Well, Vinod, can you show me? Show us what? Or should I just go to the staging or just like, see what the latest. Yeah, sure. ST was much more. But again, these guys have a lot of dependency on me. I see. Right. Whatever. They're young, and they need someone that can help them get there on this. Right? Kind of guide them. Or help them on day to day basis because they get blocked when I'm not there. Sometimes in my office I just take my laptop. I do hop on the call with them, I try to unblock them. But there are many times we are like blog like today. They are trying to release something on stage with their thought was good on Dev, but then both the environments were broken. Stage. Right now. I just showed you in the last demo that we were able to upload the document here. Then we have the pipeline and we also have the deal detail. Do you want me to go over that again? We can do that if you want. No, I think I'm interested in the pro forma piece. Yeah. Okay? So performa. If you see, I haven't taken Harvard's opinion yet, and Howard and me, I think we have amazing scheduled on Friday. Well, this idea there are any UI changes or all there, but I think pretty close to what we have in the poc. So right now if I show you almost most of the UI is ready except few things here and there. If you see right now. Just the ui. These are hard coded values which weren't supposed to be there, but still there. It's fine. Then adr so ui is completed. In a way. Now what we are trying to do is extract the data from the dock. We had great success yesterday, Nile. We are able to extract good data from PDFs and Excel in two different formats. One is. What is that called us? Eli. And there's another one. Yeah. Amp range 1 right the amplitude 1U really getting good data from both the formats, PDF as well as Excel. And then after that, we kind of insert all the values in our database and then try to bind all the data and apply the formulas, whatever formulas we have for now on that data, and show up here on the app. So. We are close to that, but we still have to sit on each value and see whether it's doing what we think it is doing, right? And test. Confirm that it is working, and I've been doing that a lot. Yesterday, I probably created 50 different days to just make sure things were working good. But we need to make it more better in a way that we have solid unit tests. Wherein we compare the functionality of the application with this test so that if there's anything broken, We can see upfront that this one's letter is not working as we expected to do.

### You (2025-08-26T21:59:08.849Z)

So.

### Guest (2025-08-26T21:59:10.766Z)

Specifically the reading of the PNLs, right? Or you mean more broadly? Just the calculations and the formulas. And the pro forma tab as well. Right now we are mostly focusing on PNLs. So summary tab, the entire sample tag. So that consists of actuals, budget, forecast, extracting all that data. Yeah, and that can be a PDF, which will basically either have multiple pages or one page, but we'll just focus on the PNL part. So right now, basically, Performa is the bigger piece. Other biggest piece was the extraction. I think we are getting very good success on that right now, but I still need to refine that. So, yeah, basically. Can I ask a question? Could we. For, like, the very. Maybe not the full mvp, but like a demo version. Drew, could you not disguise 10 hotels and, like, share them with Vinod in a formidable way so that he can just pull them up? The historicals and all of that. And then we could focus on the formulas. And then if we, if we could show that to an investor, then maybe then we spend more time on going back on the extraction piece, but just to show the vision that you can pull data and map it, we're just. Does that make sense. Or is that. I mean, yeah, I did share I don't know how many properties. With the team at some point earlier, and it's like structured data. Versus pulling data from these P and ls, which is, I would say, more unstructured. I guess the reason is. I wonder what is if we had to pick the tightest, smallest, narrowest. Feature to take to Greg. Or Access Point Financial. What is that feature that would be most appealing to them? Is it the ability to load a summary P and L and have it and have a system read that and populate the summary summary PNL numbers correctly? Into the input section. Or is it having a robust working pro forma where they can put their numbers to do the projections? Know, assuming that the historical stuff is just there already. Right. What's going to be. I mean, a. What's more appealing? To get somebody to be like, yeah, I'll write a check for this. In exchange for just knowing that it's going to work. Or getting it to work more. Not an exchange. For equity. Equity, I think, is a different story. And then what is quickest for us. To accomplish. Because if we can get the P L, the summary PNLs, if we can get that. Working in such a way that. It's stable. And usable. Then, as Greg Friedman said, it's his credit division he wants. How many PNLs do they run through every week? Probably a ton. Yeah. Right. So that has a lot of value very quickly. Gives us to test sample data. To further build that. And then we say, like, look, this is working. Pay us for this now. And the pro forma input output functionality. It's not quite done yet, but it's close. You can see this, right? And so when it is, you'll have a very good, working, simple tool to use right off the bat. That makes sense. So going back to your original question. So that's why you got the picture right where we are getting and what we are exactly trying to complete. In map. About a month away, right, from having that down, but it's taking a lot of time and effort. As I know. I don't think we're going to solve that in the next 30 days. I mean, we're going to be talking to people, but maybe we'll get one more check in September. I will say, though, that we're coming out of summer, and the lull of summer is just people don't do things and people are more active in 4Q and 1Q. Which will help us.

### You (2025-08-26T22:03:48.529Z)

So here's a couple things. Just. I can jump in. When it comes to the development. Vinod and I were messaging over the weekend, and we agreed that one of the things that would really help is to have a kickoff meeting. Where before they actually start writing code. I would go through the POC and show them what is the expected result. Go over the formulas. I want to make sure that. The engine ers understand why they're doing something as well as what the expected outcome is, so that we don't have to keep going back and fixing and plugging holes and doing things like that. So I'm not going to be able to help with the dev environment crashing or staging crashing like that, but I think we can make the developers time. More efficient if they have a really clear understanding of what they're going to be working on.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:04:54.606Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-26T22:04:54.849Z)

In that particular sprint, so I think that'll help.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:04:56.926Z)

That's a good idea. There will be useful.

### You (2025-08-26T22:04:59.809Z)

And the second thing to Drew's question and yours, Diana, is what do we think would be the most impactful? I'm putting on my asset manager hat here, and I would say that the document processing is by far the most valuable.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:05:20.446Z)

Yes.

### You (2025-08-26T22:05:20.689Z)

Of anything, because the rest of our tool, it's just Excel, it's just formulas, right? So if the data coming in is correct,

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:05:21.166Z)

I agree. Just formulas. Right.

### You (2025-08-26T22:05:31.969Z)

There's no reason why anything else would not match A plus or one plus. Two is going to be three throughout the model. If we could focus on the document process ing, I would rather push the others back a week or so. If we could just do that. To get down and sit down in front of somebody. And even you can always do it using your own data. I don't want to call it smoke and mirrors, but sometimes you can set it up so you can keep uploading the same document. Boom. Extracts the data. It's good. But what I would love to see. Is let them provide us a spreadsheet. During the demo. And if we can upload that and it extracts the data, You're going to get signatures. Right, because the rest of it's going to fall.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:06:28.766Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-26T22:06:30.849Z)

In line. Once we get that.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:06:33.486Z)

Yeah, that's kind of my thought as well. I'd be like, that's the piece that. Precedence, everything else, right? All the projection functionality is predicated upon having data, historical data populated. This is the same thing we struggle with on our side. It's like we spend all this time when building dashboards. Reports. Somebody's like, oh, that number is not right. I'm like, okay, well, we got to go back. The data has to be in there. Dashboards and reports that you got to have the data. In order. But I think again, if that's the narrowest, just thinking about expediency and getting something. Just the summary PNL too, right? But no, that's what you just sent a picture of. That's all we need to worry about initially. If we can get the summary P and L upload it. Then I shared that picture because our system was getting confused between those same items like room rooms, hotel and residential is operating revenue as well. Then it is also in department expense same same thing. Well, we can take out the profit because investors really we look at everything on an expense perspective. Operators look at things on a profit perspective, if that makes sense. So if that would help the engineering team, we can take out the entire profit section.

### You (2025-08-26T22:07:56.769Z)

Yeah. The Prophets formula. We shouldn't have to extract anything. We just extract the revenue and we extract the expenses and then the market data. So. Yeah, I saw the same thing, too. I saw that a lot of them did have the profit section. But that's something we wouldn't extract. Profit. This is your revenue minus your expenses.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:08:19.086Z)

In time, we can do it right, But Right.

### You (2025-08-26T22:08:22.369Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:08:25.406Z)

For the MVP. The AVMs are valuation s don't ever really. I mean, I've not really used profit in my. Yeah, they're always driven off expenses and profit is just a result of the calculation, the calculated result I did, Howard. I also provided feedback on the calculations or formulas. PDR a lot.

### You (2025-08-26T22:08:38.209Z)

Yeah. I saw the notifications. I haven't looked at all of them yet, but I appreciate that.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:08:50.846Z)

I don't know if that'll help Enod and the team.

### You (2025-08-26T22:08:53.729Z)

Yeah. That's why I was pushing on that, because that's what they have to do now. Once they extract that data, they need those formulas to be able to make the model work. So, yeah, I think we're in good shape now. I appreciate it.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:09:09.486Z)

Yeah. I have such a backlog right now. I haven't got to draw or I've not been checking emails or I think Howard also sent me few items. All are kind of pending. I keep promising Howard, yes, I'll get to them. I have n't.

### You (2025-08-26T22:09:23.969Z)

Yeah. Vinod, the only thing that I asked of you was just the user and account setup, and I don't think that that's really. I mean, I just need you to confirm that what's in the document is correct.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:09:38.046Z)

All right.

### You (2025-08-26T22:09:39.729Z)

Drew was very crucial to the calculations and the formulas.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:09:45.726Z)

Yeah.

### You (2025-08-26T22:09:47.329Z)

That's just it. I did send another one. Over the weekend. The AI that again? I think both you and Drew and Diane yourself as well, we can take a look at that. The idea being that in the poc. We can have a very simple AI generated summary. Of the deal. It would require having all of the data input. It would be the last thing they could do. Obviously, you can't summarize a deal that's partially done. So we were thinking, where do you put the button? On something like that. And I think the suggestion to put that on the investment summary page. Is probably the most logical place for it. So that they can take a look at the investment summary page. They can see all the metrics that are calculated, push a button and have generate a summary of the deal. Getting the market data, comp data, everything else. So that's the last PRD that we have to go over.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:11:11.086Z)

All right, I got to go to my call. I get ready for my demo. But, Diane, let's talk with Mark about this. Just focusing on this narrow piece. So until we have something that we can possibly says about you taking this to Peach Truly or Access Point Financial or maybe some brokers in exchange for ideally not investment, ideally just payment as. Okay, yeah, it can be either. But. And you need to go, Drew. So go. Peace. Good luck. Go get this host or whatever this Australia. Group is.

### You (2025-08-26T22:11:46.209Z)

Yeah. Good luck.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:11:50.766Z)

Thank you, guys. And we'll chat on what? Thursday? If not sooner. All right. Can you guys have been out and how can you guys stay on for a little bit longer? So. And I'm sorry, this is just going to be a question we have to work out, but the found, er, draw is pitifully low, right?

### You (2025-08-26T22:12:00.289Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:12:12.686Z)

And it's really depressing. Ly low. It's probably 125 to 150 a year. Is that going to work for you versus where you're working right now? Does this make sense? Because you need to be free of your day job so you can focus on this. But I think the maximum founder draw that we can include for each of us in a budget that can get investors is 125 to 150k for each of us. And I think Drew and Mark could probably defer theirs. And we. We charge, they get interest on it until we get to a point where we have more funders. Because they both have day jobs. But the three of us would need a draw. And so. You don't have to answer that right now, but that was like, I can answer so that probably you can take it. In that's conversation. 7. 150 is definitely workable. 125 is definitely low. But, yeah, 150 should be right. I've plugged 150 in for the three of us. I plugged it in for Drew and Mark, too. I just have it deferring with interest, which I believe is fair. And I mean, is it fair and reasonable? I mean, it's just realistic, right? Maybe that's a better way to put it. But the interest is market interest. It's not like it's below market interest, interest rate. Do. I understand. Probably we should put some condition that till we get good funding. Once we get good funding, then we should look for how we can put. Probably increase that. In near future. And what I've, I mean, this is what I've read, is that when you get to Series A funding, then it kind of converts to more market pay, but on the lower side of market pay. But that's when you then launch benefits and bonuses and like, when you, when you get to the Series A which I know we're not. I mean, that's going to take us like, 18 to 24 months. And unless we just really hit it out of the park with clients and it goes faster than we think it will. I'm going to add more than I definitely get paid. More than that. And I only work for literally eight hours. I'm like, I go in at 8:30 and I'm out by 4:30, and in between, I'm kind of coordinating with my team as well. Here. I understand there's more commitment and all that, but. Which is good too, right? That's what I want to do. Right. And I feel the same way. It's so far below what market salary is in the hotel investment space. It really makes me sick to my stomach. But I guess the upside here, and I really do believe this, I know I'm optimistic. But if the least AI can do this, and they can be 2 billion, right, we can do this in the a billion. I'm confident that the market is deep enough and we have the right vertical, we have the right team. Like we have so many good things going for us. That literally. I was trying to understand. Even with dilution of owner interest, even if we all get diluted down to like 5% or something like that, when we add investors, If we can actually get to a billion. And, Howard, your idea of international is an honest to God true opportunity for us because Berends are brands and they're global. So if, say we add a billion dollar valuation in five years, we could all be taking home like 10 million or something like that. Right. Even if we get diluted down. So it is. I mean, if we just set our caps to like, we can do this. We have the right vertical, we know how to go deep, we have six Personas, and we can go international in a few years. I believe we can do it.

### You (2025-08-26T22:16:08.449Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:16:09.086Z)

If Mina Song can do it, we can do it.

### You (2025-08-26T22:16:16.849Z)

The reality is we just have to know that we're not going to make as much on the front end. But when we get going on the back end, that's where it's going to come. So, yeah, I think all three of us made well above the 150. Do I want to make 150 or 200 or 250 a year for the next 10 years, or do I want to make 150 and have the bigger payout at the end? And you don't have to wait until you're sold either. You have the distributions.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:16:45.966Z)

And you will. Right.

### You (2025-08-26T22:16:51.089Z)

Everything that you can do in the meantime.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:16:56.206Z)

And at Series A will convert closer to market.

### You (2025-08-26T22:16:56.769Z)

Smaller monthly and big into year. Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:16:59.326Z)

Right. And Series A is 18 to 24 months away. So I just want you guys to believe in this, because if you. I mean, if trying to find a multifamily product that isn't already saturated, I mean, you guys know a lot of people, so I'm sure there's other products in the multifamily space, but this is 100. Untapped percent potential, right? No competitors are looking at it like we are. Yes, we will have other competitors. But I think we have a solid 12 to 18 month start on them. Our view is just something that's never even been discussed in hospitality. So stick with me, because I really believe this can happen. No, definitely. I'm definitely committed. Howard. Howard puts in so much work as well. I think he has given us really good start. So we are kind of able to build on top of that. Quick update from team as well. I've been having some challenges with Sharik to kind of get him up to the speed. So I'm also looking for little more senior person trying to find suitable ones probably, let's say if we can. Find. Probably that will be a little more expensive than sharing, but at least there would be more contribution. Shivam Ras. They both are very. Shivam is most committed. He's always working. I love about that part about him. Raj is also very committed. Sarik has been having some challenges getting up to this breed. So I'm giving him some time. Let's say hopefully he'll pick up. The stream, but I'm also looking for something else I can find, and that will be really good. Like a little bit of a node. Okay?

### You (2025-08-26T22:19:05.569Z)

Cool.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:19:06.766Z)

All right. I think that's it. Just really. You guys go read the Mina song and the Elise AI story if you haven't, because it's incredibly inspirational. I mean, I know they only have two founders and we have five, but this can be huge. And there is enough here for all of us if we can go deep into this vertical. Exactly. I believe in that, and that's why I feel like I'm wasting my time. But then I could add lot more value and, you know, do lot more work here. Rather than add driving for one hour, then I'm sitting there for eight hours, then I'm driving back. One hour. Like I'm wasting my ten hours. I know, I know.

### You (2025-08-26T22:19:45.969Z)

Yeah.

### Guest (2025-08-26T22:19:47.166Z)

I'm sorry, Vinod. I wish I had a million in funding for us to start out. But fortunately there's no rich Berends In the box household. I understand that in a similar board, yeah. Yes. All right, guys, thank you, and we will talk Thursday. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Okay. Bye.
