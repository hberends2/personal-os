**Meeting ID:** 2212c062-8ca6-473a-9469-5ec1329bac7f

## Granola Summary

POC Demo & Technical Updates

Demonstrated updated InnXchange POC with improved interface

Added search functionality and column customization

Streamlined property addition workflow with 4-page modal

Enhanced valuation calculations with real-time updates

Fixed equity percentage validation (must total 100%)

Visual improvements to match Excel-like interface

Cleaner penetration/revenue analysis displays

Collapsible sections for better navigation

Consistent column alignment throughout

Terminology adjustments needed for hotel industry

Change "Revenue" tab to "Penetration Analysis"

Separate occupancy, ADR, RevPAR metrics (hotels view these together, not independently)

Hotel cap rates typically 7-8% range vs multifamily 4% range

Partnership Strategy & Market Approach

Four target partnership options prioritized:

Atelier (first choice) - US-focused with Sri Lanka tech team

Hot Stats - acquired by Duetto (SaaS platform), UK presence

Calibri - led by Cindy Estes Green

M3 - partially acquired by Blackstone, processes P&L data

Marketplace integration planned similar to DealPath's CBRE/JLL model

Brokers can share deals publicly or privately

Built-in confidentiality agreements and LOI generation

Commission structure: $2,000 flat fee or $2,000 + 5 bps on purchase price

Seeking experienced startup advisor with hotel tech background

Ben Rafter (Hotel Equities) - built 2 successful exits, tech-oriented

Sloan - COO/CEO level, capital markets + operations experience

Vinod & Technical Team Discussion

Vinod willing to handle GitHub transfer process when agreements signed

No current contact with Drew, unlikely to return immediately

Would consider returning only with salary (not equity-only arrangement)

Claude Code development more enterprise-ready than Lovable/Bold alternatives

Current POC needs security enhancements for SOC2 compliance

Single sign-on and multi-user capabilities required for production

Next Steps

Diane: Finalize pitch deck by tomorrow morning for Sloan meeting

Diane: Pursue Ben Rafter introduction through Joe Reardon at Hotel Equities

Howard: Provide 3 POC screenshots for pitch deck inclusion

Howard: Email terminology changes for hotel industry alignment

Both: Schedule follow-up with Pranav at Driftoid after Sloan pitch

Both: Evaluate partnership options over next 4-6 weeks
