**Meeting ID:** 37b8a12e-3a1b-4331-a538-f45ad6b245a1

## Granola Summary

Pitch Deck Review & Feedback

Diane created comprehensive pitch deck from scratch using Pop AI

Avoided previous work from Drew/Mark entirely

Used structured framework from LinkedIn startup expert

Key positioning: "AI-powered operating system for hotel real estate investments"

Combines DealPath + RedIQ + Paraview functionality

Pipeline management, AI underwriting, equity/debt asset management

Market sizing: $57.4B global transaction volume (2024)

Growing 15-25% to $72B in 2025

Represents 6% of total global CRE transactions

JLL projects $178B by 2034

Claude/Excel Integration Discussion

Diane included Claude Excel announcement in deck

Howard recommended removing specific Claude references

Not a direct threat to core platform value

Only helps Excel users who refuse other solutions

Risk of drawing attention to well-funded competitor

Suggested reframing as general "AI Excel integration" if mentioned

Emphasize platform provides value beyond underwriting models

Data extraction, market analysis still require dedicated solution

Revenue Projections & Pricing

Two pathway scenarios presented:

Lighthouse client approach: 3 customers by month 9, scaling to 10 by month 18

$14K per user annually (Howard suggested reducing to 4 users average vs 6)

$252K ARR by month 9, $960K by month 18

Enterprise account: Land JLL/CBRE with 30 users at $20K each

$500K ARR from single enterprise client

Howard emphasized need to justify user counts and pricing

Archer data shows 4 users average for major investors

Suggested adding 24-month projection to show $1M+ ARR milestone

Missing Marketplace Component

Howard identified gap: marketplace needed before transaction management

Marketplace functionality:

Direct broker-investor interaction within platform

Investor profiles with investment criteria

Automated notifications for matching deals

Embedded confidentiality agreements and LOI templates

Revenue potential significant and largely automated

Must precede full transaction management capabilities

Strategic Partnerships & Networking

Upcoming call Feb 3 with Sloan Dean (former Remington Hotels)

17-year hospitality operations background

Transitioning to technology role/founding company

Connected to tech-forward industry leaders

Target introduction: Ben Rafter at Hotel Equities

Startup background with two successful exits

Current CEO after Springboard acquisition

Hotel Equities is Otellier customer (potential data partnership)

Funding ask: $1.2M over 18 months

$520K people/payroll (includes sales, engineering roles)

Strategic partnerships and AI integrations prioritized

Next Steps

Howard: Review POC on Monday 11 AM

Diane: Add marketplace slide before transaction management

Diane: Remove Claude references, adjust user counts to 4 average

Diane: Clean up pitch deck formatting with uncle's help before Ben Rafter meeting
