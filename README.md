## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanaiproduct/howard-os.git
cd howard-os
```

### 2. Run Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The setup will:
- Create your workspace directories
- Guide you through questions about your goals and priorities
- Generate your personalized GOALS.md
- Copy template files

**Note:** Python 3.10+ is only needed if you want to run the MCP server. The basic setup works with just bash.

### 3. Start Using It
```
# In your AI assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
"Read AGENTS.md and help me get organized"
```

## How It Works

1. **Brain dump** - Drop notes into `BACKLOG.md` (no structure needed)
2. **Process** - Say "process my backlog" to your AI
3. **Get organized** - AI creates prioritized tasks based on your GOALS.md
4. **Stay focused** - Ask "what should I work on?" for smart suggestions

### Common Commands

- `"What should I work on today?"` - Morning briefing with calendar, email, and tasks
- `"Process my backlog"` - Turn notes into tasks
- `"Show me my P0 tasks"` - See urgent items
- `"Any emails I should respond to first?"` - Surface action-required email
- `"What's on my calendar tomorrow?"` - Preview next business day
- `"Mark [task] as done"` - Complete work
- `"Import my Linear issues"` - Sync Linear tasks (optional)
- `"Sync Linear with local tasks"` - Two-way sync (optional)

### Priorities

| Priority | Meaning | Limit |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **P0** | Do today | max 3 |
| **P1** | This week | max 7 |
| **P2** | Scheduled | - |
| **P3** | Someday/maybe | - |

```

## Daily Workflow

**Morning:** `"What should I work on today?"` → AI reads your calendar, unread email, and tasks, then suggests 1-3 priorities

**During work:** Brain dump into Apple Notes "Brain Dump" → auto-synced to BACKLOG.md every 30 min

**End of day:** `"Mark [task] as done"`

**Weekly:** `"Process my backlog"` + `"Clean up old tasks"`

## Features

- Goal-driven prioritization based on your vision
- Smart deduplication detects duplicate tasks
- Natural language - just talk to your AI
- Session evals to review and learn from AI interactions
- 2-minute setup, no Python required
- MCP integration for Claude and other AI assistants
- Linear integration for team collaboration (optional)
- Apple ecosystem sync (Calendar, Mail, Notes) via `sync_local.sh` running every 30 min

## Integrations

### Linear

HowardOS integrates seamlessly with Linear project management:
- **Import issues**: Pull assigned Linear issues into your daily planning
- **Create issues**: Push tasks from your backlog to Linear
- **Two-way sync**: Keep Linear and local tasks in sync
- **Query anywhere**: Ask questions about Linear issues directly
- **Automated workflows**: Convert Granola meetings → Linear todos
- **Persistent auth**: OAuth token survives restarts (no re-auth needed)

**Setup:**
1. Linear MCP server is pre-configured in `.mcp.json`
2. Restart Claude Code to load the Linear MCP server
3. On first use, OAuth auto-triggers (one-time browser authorization)
4. Token persists - ready for automated workflows

**Quick start:**
```
"Import my Linear issues for today"
"Process yesterday's Granola meetings and create Linear action items"
```

**Documentation:**
- Setup guide: `docs/LINEAR_SETUP.md`
- Sync workflows: `examples/workflows/linear-sync.md`
- Granola → Linear: `examples/workflows/granola-to-linear-sync.md`

### Apple Ecosystem (Calendar, Mail, Notes)

HowardOS syncs automatically with your Apple apps every 30 minutes via `sync_local.sh` (scheduled via macOS launchd):

| Source | Destination | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Apple Notes "Brain Dump" | `BACKLOG.md` | Full note content, HTML stripped |
| Apple Calendar | `Tasks/TODAY_CALENDAR.md` | **Today** (full table) + **next business day** (summary). Excludes Calvin Calendar and system calendars. All events now synced correctly. |
| Apple Mail | `Tasks/TODAY_EMAIL.md` | Unread from **last 48hrs** (all messages captured, newest first). Includes iCloud, Gmail, Berends Consulting. Excludes InnVestAI and live.com. |

All three files are auto-loaded into every Claude Code session via `CLAUDE.md` `@` imports.

**Sync Details:**
- **Calendar**: Captures today's events (full details) and next business day preview
- **Email**: Returns all unread messages from the past 48 hours, properly sorted by recency
- **Notes**: Extracts plain text from "Brain Dump" note (HTML tags stripped)

**Manual run:**
```bash
"/Users/howardberends/Claude Code/howard-os/sync_local.sh"
```

**Logs:** `~/Library/Logs/howard-os-sync.log`
- Main sync log: `howard-os-sync.log`
- Detailed errors: `howard-os-sync-error.log`

### Granola (Meeting Intelligence)

Meeting data syncs automatically — no manual steps needed:

1. **Obsidian Granola plugin** exports structured meeting files from Granola
2. **`obsidian_sync.py`** processes those files and writes directly to `Knowledge/Transcripts/`

Meeting content is organized into three subfolders:

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `Knowledge/Transcripts/alter_summaries/` | AI-structured summaries by topic section (269+ files) |
| `Knowledge/Transcripts/alter_action_items/` | Extracted action items, owner-prefixed (186+ files) |
| `Knowledge/Transcripts/transcripts/` | Full raw transcripts (reference only, 239+ files) |

**Manual sync trigger:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Alter/granola_sync
python3 scripts/obsidian_sync.py
```

See **[README_OBSIDIAN_SYNC.md](../../Documents/Alter/granola_sync/README_OBSIDIAN_SYNC.md)** for detailed configuration and troubleshooting.
